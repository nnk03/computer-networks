Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book I. The History Of A Family
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and
Enter Input : still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which
Enter Input : happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper
Enter Input : place. For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so we
Enter Input : used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own
Enter Input : estate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a
Enter Input : type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of
Enter Input : those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their
Enter Input : worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest;
Enter Input : he ran to dine at other men’s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet
Enter Input : at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard
Enter Input : cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless,
Enter Input : fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not
Enter Input : stupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and
Enter Input : intelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first
Enter Input : wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch’s first
Enter Input : wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble
Enter Input : family, also landowners in our district, the Miüsovs. How it came to pass
Enter Input : that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those
Enter Input : vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes
Enter Input : also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny
Enter Input : weakling, as we all called him, I won’t attempt to explain. I knew a young
Enter Input : lady of the last “romantic” generation who after some years of an
Enter Input : enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have
Enter Input : married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and
Enter Input : ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid
Enter Input : river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to
Enter Input : satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, if
Enter Input : this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less
Enter Input : picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most
Enter Input : likely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and
Enter Input : probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or
Enter Input : three generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s action was similarly, no
Enter Input : doubt, an echo of other people’s ideas, and was due to the irritation
Enter Input : caused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her
Enter Input : feminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism of
Enter Input : her family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for
Enter Input : a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic
Enter Input : position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive
Enter Input : epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
Enter Input : What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement,
Enter Input : and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy. Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, for
Enter Input : he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another. To
Enter Input : attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring
Enter Input : prospect. As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in the
Enter Input : bride or in him, in spite of Adelaïda Ivanovna’s beauty. This was,
Enter Input : perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who
Enter Input : was always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on
Enter Input : the slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman who
Enter Input : made no particular appeal to his senses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Immediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flash
Enter Input : that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage
Enter Input : accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.
Enter Input : Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the
Enter Input : runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most
Enter Input : disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It was
Enter Input : said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity
Enter Input : than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up
Enter Input : to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that those
Enter Input : thousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the rather
Enter Input : fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a
Enter Input : long time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance. He
Enter Input : would probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire to
Enter Input : get rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his
Enter Input : persistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda
Enter Input : Ivanovna’s family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is known
Enter Input : for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife,
Enter Input : but rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was
Enter Input : beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient
Enter Input : woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the
Enter Input : house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity
Enter Input : student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband’s
Enter Input : hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the
Enter Input : house, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he
Enter Input : used to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all
Enter Input : of Adelaïda Ivanovna’s having left him, going into details too disgraceful
Enter Input : for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to
Enter Input : gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part
Enter Input : of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One would think that you’d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seem
Enter Input : so pleased in spite of your sorrow,” scoffers said to him. Many even added
Enter Input : that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and
Enter Input : that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of
Enter Input : his ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At
Enter Input : last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor
Enter Input : woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity
Enter Input : student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete
Enter Input : emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making
Enter Input : preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself
Enter Input : have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do
Enter Input : so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another
Enter Input : bout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife’s family
Enter Input : received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly
Enter Input : in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had
Enter Input : it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife’s
Enter Input : death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting
Enter Input : with joy, raising his hands to Heaven: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
Enter Input : depart in peace,” but others say he wept without restraint like a little
Enter Input : child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the
Enter Input : repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true,
Enter Input : that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who
Enter Input : released him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more
Enter Input : naïve and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would
Enter Input : bring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what might be
Enter Input : expected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with Adelaïda
Enter Input : Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but
Enter Input : simply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his
Enter Input : tears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a
Enter Input : faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya
Enter Input : into his care. If he hadn’t looked after him there would have been no one
Enter Input : even to change the baby’s little shirt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened moreover that the child’s relations on his mother’s side
Enter Input : forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow,
Enter Input : Mitya’s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his
Enter Input : daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in
Enter Input : old Grigory’s charge and lived with him in the servant’s cottage. But if
Enter Input : his father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether
Enter Input : unaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as
Enter Input : the child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a
Enter Input : cousin of Mitya’s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, happened to return
Enter Input : from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that
Enter Input : time quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miüsovs as a man of
Enter Input : enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals
Enter Input : and abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the type
Enter Input : common in the forties and fifties. In the course of his career he had come
Enter Input : into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in
Enter Input : Russia and abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in
Enter Input : his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the
Enter Input : Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost
Enter Input : taken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most
Enter Input : grateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of
Enter Input : about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate
Enter Input : lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our
Enter Input : famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless
Enter Input : lawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rights
Enter Input : of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I don’t know
Enter Input : exactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of
Enter Input : culture to open an attack upon the “clericals.” Hearing all about Adelaïda
Enter Input : Ivanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time
Enter Input : been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, in
Enter Input : spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : He made the latter’s acquaintance for the first time, and told him
Enter Input : directly that he wished to undertake the child’s education. He used long
Enter Input : afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak
Enter Input : of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not
Enter Input : understand what child he was talking about, and even as though he was
Enter Input : surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story may
Enter Input : have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an
Enter Input : unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to
Enter Input : his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This
Enter Input : habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some
Enter Input : of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch
Enter Input : carried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house
Enter Input : and land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this
Enter Input : cousin’s keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and after
Enter Input : securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to
Enter Input : Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living in
Enter Input : Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too,
Enter Input : forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out,
Enter Input : making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his
Enter Input : life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her
Enter Input : married daughters. I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. I
Enter Input : won’t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential
Enter Input : facts about him, without which I could not begin my story.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the
Enter Input : only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s three sons who grew up in the belief that
Enter Input : he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. He
Enter Input : spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the
Enter Input : gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was
Enter Input : promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion
Enter Input : again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin
Enter Input : to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and
Enter Input : until then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : for the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on
Enter Input : purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have liked
Enter Input : his father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away,
Enter Input : having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an
Enter Input : agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value
Enter Input : of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get
Enter Input : a statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time
Enter Input : then (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated
Enter Input : idea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this,
Enter Input : as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young man
Enter Input : was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and
Enter Input : that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although
Enter Input : only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take
Enter Input : advantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles,
Enter Input : installments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience,
Enter Input : came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his
Enter Input : father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was
Enter Input : difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of
Enter Input : his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even
Enter Input : in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own
Enter Input : desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect
Enter Input : anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed,
Enter Input : suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed,
Enter Input : this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the
Enter Input : subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.
Enter Input : But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : other two sons, and of their origin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years.
Enter Input : He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from
Enter Input : another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in
Enter Input : company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious
Enter Input : debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his
Enter Input : business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not
Enter Input : over-scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon,
Enter Input : and was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up in
Enter Input : the house of a general’s widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who
Enter Input : was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, but
Enter Input : I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, was
Enter Input : once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the
Enter Input : loft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting
Enter Input : nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had
Enter Input : become an insufferable tyrant through idleness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and he
Enter Input : was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopement
Enter Input : to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would not on any
Enter Input : account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.
Enter Input : But she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl of
Enter Input : sixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom of
Enter Input : the river than remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child
Enter Input : exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a
Enter Input : penny this time, for the general’s widow was furious. She gave them
Enter Input : nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry; what
Enter Input : allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all her
Enter Input : innocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious
Enter Input : profligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine
Enter Input : beauty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,” he used to say
Enter Input : afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this might,
Enter Input : of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had received no
Enter Input : dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her “from the halter,” he
Enter Input : did not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel that she had “wronged”
Enter Input : him, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to
Enter Input : trample on the elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women
Enter Input : into his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife’s
Enter Input : presence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that
Enter Input : Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had
Enter Input : always hated his first mistress, Adelaïda Ivanovna, took the side of his
Enter Input : new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a
Enter Input : manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels
Enter Input : and drove all the disorderly women out of the house. In the end this
Enter Input : unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that
Enter Input : kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women
Enter Input : who are said to be “possessed by devils.” At times after terrible fits of
Enter Input : hysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two
Enter Input : sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the
Enter Input : second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth
Enter Input : year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all
Enter Input : his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same
Enter Input : thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.
Enter Input : They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were
Enter Input : looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were
Enter Input : found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was
Enter Input : still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done
Enter Input : her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya’s
Enter Input : manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she
Enter Input : declared aloud two or three times to her retainers:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna’s death the general’s widow
Enter Input : suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.
Enter Input : It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eight
Enter Input : years, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him,
Enter Input : without any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slaps
Enter Input : on the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times up
Enter Input : and down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to the
Enter Input : two boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in
Enter Input : dirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and
Enter Input : announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them
Enter Input : just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to her
Enter Input : own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word,
Enter Input : and when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow
Enter Input : and pronounced impressively that, “God would repay her for the orphans.”
Enter Input : “You are a blockhead all the same,” the old lady shouted to him as she
Enter Input : drove away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, and
Enter Input : did not refuse the general’s widow his formal consent to any proposition
Enter Input : in regard to his children’s education. As for the slaps she had given him,
Enter Input : he drove all over the town telling the story.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the boys
Enter Input : in her will a thousand roubles each “for their instruction, and so that
Enter Input : all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so
Enter Input : portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it is more than
Enter Input : adequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to throw
Enter Input : away their money, let them.” I have not read the will myself, but I heard
Enter Input : there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. The
Enter Input : principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the
Enter Input : province, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him
Enter Input : for his children’s education (though the latter never directly refused but
Enter Input : only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was, indeed, at
Enter Input : times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interest
Enter Input : in the orphans. He became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, who
Enter Input : lived for a long while as one of his family. I beg the reader to note this
Enter Input : from the beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and
Enter Input : humanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted for
Enter Input : their education and bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand
Enter Input : roubles left to them by the general’s widow intact, so that by the time
Enter Input : they came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of
Enter Input : interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent
Enter Input : far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won’t enter into a
Enter Input : detailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few
Enter Input : of the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he
Enter Input : grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. At
Enter Input : ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home
Enter Input : but on other people’s charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
Enter Input : was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancy
Enter Input : (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for
Enter Input : learning. I don’t know precisely why, but he left the family of Yefim
Enter Input : Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and
Enter Input : boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of
Enter Input : Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to
Enter Input : the “ardor for good works” of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the
Enter Input : idea that the boy’s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
Enter Input : neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man
Enter Input : finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch
Enter Input : had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady’s legacy,
Enter Input : which had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to
Enter Input : formalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits
Enter Input : for the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep
Enter Input : himself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not
Enter Input : even attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from
Enter Input : contempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him
Enter Input : that from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that may
Enter Input : have been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in
Enter Input : getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting
Enter Input : paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of
Enter Input : “Eye-Witness.” These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting and
Enter Input : piquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young man’s
Enter Input : practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and
Enter Input : unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the
Enter Input : newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than
Enter Input : everlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.
Enter Input : Having once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept
Enter Input : up his connection with them, and in his latter years at the university he
Enter Input : published brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
Enter Input : that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his last year
Enter Input : he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of
Enter Input : readers, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It was
Enter Input : rather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and was
Enter Input : preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : published in one of the more important journals a strange article, which
Enter Input : attracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have been
Enter Input : supposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. The
Enter Input : article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the
Enter Input : time—the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several
Enter Input : opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most
Enter Input : striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion.
Enter Input : Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.
Enter Input : And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their
Enter Input : applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was
Enter Input : nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident
Enter Input : particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in
Enter Input : our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the
Enter Input : question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.
Enter Input : Learning the author’s name, they were interested in his being a native of
Enter Input : the town and the son of “that Fyodor Pavlovitch.” And just then it was
Enter Input : that the author himself made his appearance among us.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the
Enter Input : time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first
Enter Input : step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.
Enter Input : It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud,
Enter Input : and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house
Enter Input : and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never
Enter Input : thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him
Enter Input : money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
Enter Input : also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the
Enter Input : house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they
Enter Input : were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of
Enter Input : wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of
Enter Input : whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s first wife,
Enter Input : happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had
Enter Input : come from Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was more
Enter Input : surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man, who
Enter Input : interested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not
Enter Input : without an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is proud,” he used to say, “he will never be in want of pence; he has
Enter Input : got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every one can
Enter Input : see that he hasn’t come for money, for his father would never give him
Enter Input : any. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his father can’t
Enter Input : do without him. They get on so well together!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over his
Enter Input : father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even
Enter Input : seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and even
Enter Input : spitefully perverse.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the request
Enter Input : of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he saw for
Enter Input : the first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving Moscow
Enter Input : been in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concern
Enter Input : to Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader will learn fully
Enter Input : in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still
Enter Input : felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit
Enter Input : rather mysterious.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator
Enter Input : between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel
Enter Input : with his father and even planning to bring an action against him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its
Enter Input : members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,
Enter Input : Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the
Enter Input : three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to
Enter Input : speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of
Enter Input : him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce
Enter Input : my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been
Enter Input : for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered
Enter Input : there for the rest of his life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at the
Enter Input : time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven. First of all, I
Enter Input : must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my
Enter Input : opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my full
Enter Input : opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and
Enter Input : that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it
Enter Input : struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from
Enter Input : the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason
Enter Input : this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as
Enter Input : he thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whom
Enter Input : he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart. But I
Enter Input : do not dispute that he was very strange even at that time, and had been so
Enter Input : indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned already, by the way, that though
Enter Input : he lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life—her
Enter Input : face, her caresses, “as though she stood living before me.” Such memories
Enter Input : may persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two
Enter Input : years old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots
Enter Input : of light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which
Enter Input : has all faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
Enter Input : with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the
Enter Input : slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all);
Enter Input : in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on
Enter Input : her knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and
Enter Input : moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,
Enter Input : and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both arms to
Enter Input : the image as though to put him under the Mother’s protection ... and
Enter Input : suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the
Enter Input : picture! And Alyosha remembered his mother’s face at that minute. He used
Enter Input : to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely
Enter Input : cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth he
Enter Input : was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness
Enter Input : or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different,
Enter Input : from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with
Enter Input : other people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, to
Enter Input : forget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed
Enter Input : throughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever
Enter Input : looked on him as a simpleton or naïve person. There was something about
Enter Input : him which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards)
Enter Input : that he did not care to be a judge of others—that he would never take it
Enter Input : upon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. He
Enter Input : seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though
Enter Input : often grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could
Enter Input : surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty to
Enter Input : his father’s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste
Enter Input : and pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on was
Enter Input : unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.
Enter Input : His father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so was
Enter Input : sensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and
Enter Input : sullenness. “He does not say much,” he used to say, “and thinks the more.”
Enter Input : But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissing
Enter Input : him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yet
Enter Input : he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had never
Enter Input : been capable of feeling for any one before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was so
Enter Input : from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his patron
Enter Input : and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts of all the
Enter Input : family, so that they looked on him quite as their own child. Yet he
Enter Input : entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted from
Enter Input : design nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift of making
Enter Input : himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very
Enter Input : nature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he seemed to be
Enter Input : just one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and
Enter Input : even disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and
Enter Input : rather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into
Enter Input : a corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
Enter Input : at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at the
Enter Input : first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the contrary he was
Enter Input : bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off among his
Enter Input : schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never afraid of any one,
Enter Input : yet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his
Enter Input : fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous. He
Enter Input : never resented an insult. It would happen that an hour after the offense
Enter Input : he would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and
Enter Input : candid an expression as though nothing had happened between them. And it
Enter Input : was not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the
Enter Input : affront, but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this
Enter Input : completely conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
Enter Input : which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to
Enter Input : mock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. This
Enter Input : characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could not
Enter Input : bear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women. There
Enter Input : are “certain” words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in
Enter Input : schools. Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking
Enter Input : in school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and
Enter Input : images of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than
Enter Input : that, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to
Enter Input : quite young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
Enter Input : moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the
Enter Input : appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something
Enter Input : refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha
Enter Input : Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of “that,” they
Enter Input : used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shout
Enter Input : nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor, tried
Enter Input : to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insults
Enter Input : in silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him with
Enter Input : being a “regular girl,” and what’s more they looked upon it with
Enter Input : compassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in the class but
Enter Input : was never first.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the time of Yefim Petrovitch’s death Alyosha had two more years to
Enter Input : complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went almost
Enter Input : immediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her whole
Enter Input : family, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to live in
Enter Input : the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had
Enter Input : never seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did not know
Enter Input : himself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at
Enter Input : whose expense he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to
Enter Input : his elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two years
Enter Input : in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had from
Enter Input : childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his
Enter Input : benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha’s character must not, I
Enter Input : think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance with
Enter Input : him any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths,
Enter Input : almost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to
Enter Input : come into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give it
Enter Input : away for the asking, either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue.
Enter Input : In general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course,
Enter Input : in a literal sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked
Enter Input : for, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a
Enter Input : moment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive on the
Enter Input : score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment,
Enter Input : after getting to know Alyosha:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone
Enter Input : without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million
Enter Input : inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold and
Enter Input : hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were not, he
Enter Input : would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort or
Enter Input : humiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on the contrary,
Enter Input : would probably be looked on as a pleasure.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end of
Enter Input : the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to see
Enter Input : his father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry and
Enter Input : unwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and the
Enter Input : ladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from his
Enter Input : benefactor’s family. They provided him liberally with money and even
Enter Input : fitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the money
Enter Input : they gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival
Enter Input : in the town he made no answer to his father’s first inquiry why he had
Enter Input : come before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
Enter Input : thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother’s
Enter Input : tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only
Enter Input : object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.
Enter Input : It is more probable that he himself did not understand and could not
Enter Input : explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn him irresistibly
Enter Input : into a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show
Enter Input : him where his second wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave
Enter Input : since he had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had
Enter Input : entirely forgotten where she was buried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been
Enter Input : living in our town. Three or four years after his wife’s death he had gone
Enter Input : to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he spent
Enter Input : several years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own words, “of a
Enter Input : lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,” and ended by being received by
Enter Input : “Jews high and low alike.” It may be presumed that at this period he
Enter Input : developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money. He finally
Enter Input : returned to our town only three years before Alyosha’s arrival. His former
Enter Input : acquaintances found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means
Enter Input : an old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more
Enter Input : effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making
Enter Input : buffoons of others. His depravity with women was not simply what it used
Enter Input : to be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a great number
Enter Input : of new taverns in the district. It was evident that he had perhaps a
Enter Input : hundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of the inhabitants of the
Enter Input : town and district were soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good
Enter Input : security. Of late, too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more
Enter Input : irresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to
Enter Input : begin one thing and go on with another, as though he were letting himself
Enter Input : go altogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not
Enter Input : been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerably
Enter Input : too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyosha’s arrival seemed
Enter Input : to affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in this
Enter Input : prematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know,” he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, “that you are
Enter Input : like her, ‘the crazy woman’ ”—that was what he used to call his dead wife,
Enter Input : Alyosha’s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the “crazy woman’s” grave
Enter Input : to Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remote
Enter Input : corner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which were
Enter Input : inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death, and
Enter Input : below a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned
Enter Input : middle-class tombs. To Alyosha’s amazement this tomb turned out to be
Enter Input : Grigory’s doing. He had put it up on the poor “crazy woman’s” grave at his
Enter Input : own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about the
Enter Input : grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories.
Enter Input : Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother’s grave.
Enter Input : He only listened to Grigory’s minute and solemn account of the erection of
Enter Input : the tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a
Enter Input : word. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this
Enter Input : little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch—and a
Enter Input : very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to
Enter Input : pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,
Enter Input : Alyosha’s mother, the “crazy woman,” but for the first, Adelaïda Ivanovna,
Enter Input : who used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and
Enter Input : abused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he
Enter Input : had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange
Enter Input : impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at this
Enter Input : time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he
Enter Input : had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent,
Enter Input : suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in
Enter Input : his little fat face, the Adam’s apple hung below his sharp chin like a
Enter Input : great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual
Enter Input : appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between
Enter Input : which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobbered
Enter Input : every time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his own
Enter Input : face, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it. He used
Enter Input : particularly to point to his nose, which was not very large, but very
Enter Input : delicate and conspicuously aquiline. “A regular Roman nose,” he used to
Enter Input : say, “with my goiter I’ve quite the countenance of an ancient Roman
Enter Input : patrician of the decadent period.” He seemed proud of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Not long after visiting his mother’s grave Alyosha suddenly announced that
Enter Input : he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing to
Enter Input : receive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong desire, and
Enter Input : that he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The old man knew
Enter Input : that the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, had
Enter Input : made a special impression upon his “gentle boy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That is the most honest monk among them, of course,” he observed, after
Enter Input : listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprised
Enter Input : at his request. “H’m!... So that’s where you want to be, my gentle boy?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken grin,
Enter Input : which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. “H’m!... I had
Enter Input : a presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would you
Enter Input : believe it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you have
Enter Input : your own two thousand. That’s a dowry for you. And I’ll never desert you,
Enter Input : my angel. And I’ll pay what’s wanted for you there, if they ask for it.
Enter Input : But, of course, if they don’t ask, why should we worry them? What do you
Enter Input : say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H’m!...
Enter Input : Do you know that near one monastery there’s a place outside the town where
Enter Input : every baby knows there are none but ‘the monks’ wives’ living, as they are
Enter Input : called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it’s
Enter Input : interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is
Enter Input : it’s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they
Enter Input : could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear
Enter Input : of it they’ll come along. Well, there’s nothing of that sort here, no
Enter Input : ‘monks’ wives,’ and two hundred monks. They’re honest. They keep the
Enter Input : fasts. I admit it.... H’m.... So you want to be a monk? And do you know
Enter Input : I’m sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I’ve really grown
Enter Input : fond of you? Well, it’s a good opportunity. You’ll pray for us sinners; we
Enter Input : have sinned too much here. I’ve always been thinking who would pray for
Enter Input : me, and whether there’s any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I’m
Enter Input : awfully stupid about that. You wouldn’t believe it. Awfully. You see,
Enter Input : however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking—from time
Enter Input : to time, of course, not all the while. It’s impossible, I think, for the
Enter Input : devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. Then
Enter Input : I wonder—hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do
Enter Input : they forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in the
Enter Input : monastery probably believe that there’s a ceiling in hell, for instance.
Enter Input : Now I’m ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it more
Enter Input : refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after all, what
Enter Input : does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn’t? But, do you know,
Enter Input : there’s a damnable question involved in it? If there’s no ceiling there
Enter Input : can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which is
Enter Input : unlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me down to hell, and
Enter Input : if they don’t drag me down what justice is there in the world? _Il
Enter Input : faudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if you
Enter Input : only knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But there are no hooks there,” said Alyosha, looking gently and seriously
Enter Input : at his father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That’s how a
Enter Input : Frenchman described hell: ‘_J’ai bu l’ombre d’un cocher qui avec l’ombre
Enter Input : d’une brosse frottait l’ombre d’une carrosse._’ How do you know there are
Enter Input : no hooks, darling? When you’ve lived with the monks you’ll sing a
Enter Input : different tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tell
Enter Input : me. Anyway it’s easier going to the other world if one knows what there is
Enter Input : there. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here
Enter Input : with me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you’re like
Enter Input : an angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch you
Enter Input : there. That’s why I let you go, because I hope for that. You’ve got all
Enter Input : your wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will be
Enter Input : healed and come back again. And I will wait for you. I feel that you’re
Enter Input : the only creature in the world who has not condemned me. My dear boy, I
Enter Input : feel it, you know. I can’t help feeling it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked and
Enter Input : sentimental.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. Elders
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic,
Enter Input : poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On the contrary,
Enter Input : Alyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of
Enter Input : nineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome, too, graceful,
Enter Input : moderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long,
Enter Input : oval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he was very
Enter Input : thoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red
Enter Input : cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy
Enter Input : that Alyosha was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the
Enter Input : monastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are
Enter Input : never a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
Enter Input : realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
Enter Input : always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if
Enter Input : he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather
Enter Input : disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he
Enter Input : admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does
Enter Input : not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.
Enter Input : If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to
Enter Input : admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not
Enter Input : believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, “My Lord and my God!”
Enter Input : Was it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed
Enter Input : solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his
Enter Input : secret heart even when he said, “I do not believe till I see.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had not
Enter Input : finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies is
Enter Input : true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
Enter Input : I’ll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path only
Enter Input : because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and presented
Enter Input : itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul from
Enter Input : darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of our
Enter Input : last epoch—that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for it
Enter Input : and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength
Enter Input : of his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice
Enter Input : everything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily fail to
Enter Input : understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest of
Enter Input : all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years of
Enter Input : their seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiply
Enter Input : tenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set
Enter Input : before them as their goal—such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength
Enter Input : of many of them. The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite
Enter Input : direction, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As
Enter Input : soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God
Enter Input : and immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: “I want to
Enter Input : live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.” In the same way,
Enter Input : if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at once
Enter Input : have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely the
Enter Input : labor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the
Enter Input : question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower of
Enter Input : Babel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up
Enter Input : heaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go
Enter Input : on living as before. It is written: “Give all that thou hast to the poor
Enter Input : and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha said to himself: “I can’t give two roubles instead of ‘all,’ and
Enter Input : only go to mass instead of ‘following Him.’ ” Perhaps his memories of
Enter Input : childhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have taken
Enter Input : him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his
Enter Input : poor “crazy” mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination.
Enter Input : Brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see
Enter Input : whether here he could sacrifice all or only “two roubles,” and in the
Enter Input : monastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what an “elder” is
Enter Input : in Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent
Enter Input : to do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a
Enter Input : few words. Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of
Enter Input : “elders” is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our
Enter Input : monasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos,
Enter Input : it has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
Enter Input : ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
Enter Input : Russia—the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the East
Enter Input : after the destruction of Constantinople—this institution fell into
Enter Input : oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end of last century by one
Enter Input : of the great “ascetics,” as they called him, Païssy Velitchkovsky, and his
Enter Input : disciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and has
Enter Input : sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It flourished
Enter Input : especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was
Enter Input : introduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three
Enter Input : such elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying of
Enter Input : weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The question
Enter Input : for our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguished
Enter Input : by anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints,
Enter Input : nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical
Enter Input : exploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its
Enter Input : elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles
Enter Input : from all parts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,
Enter Input : into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your
Enter Input : own will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete
Enter Input : self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is
Enter Input : undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, in
Enter Input : order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from
Enter Input : self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without
Enter Input : finding their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is not
Enter Input : founded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of a
Enter Input : thousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary
Enter Input : “obedience” which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
Enter Input : obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
Enter Input : themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
Enter Input : one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his
Enter Input : elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after great
Enter Input : exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr’s
Enter Input : death for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, was
Enter Input : burying him, suddenly, at the deacon’s exhortation, “Depart all ye
Enter Input : unbaptized,” the coffin containing the martyr’s body left its place and
Enter Input : was cast forth from the church, and this took place three times. And only
Enter Input : at last they learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and
Enter Input : left his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder’s
Enter Input : absolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral
Enter Input : take place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
Enter Input : instance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he loved
Enter Input : as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem to
Enter Input : do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:
Enter Input : “There is the place for thee and not here.” The monk, overwhelmed with
Enter Input : sorrow, went to the Œcumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought
Enter Input : him to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not
Enter Input : only was he unable to release him, but there was not and could not be on
Enter Input : earth a power which could release him except the elder who had himself
Enter Input : laid that duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain
Enter Input : cases with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many of
Enter Input : our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
Enter Input : persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed
Enter Input : among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men of
Enter Input : distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery to
Enter Input : confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask for
Enter Input : counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declared
Enter Input : that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously
Enter Input : degraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the
Enter Input : monk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In the
Enter Input : end, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming
Enter Input : established in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this
Enter Input : instrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral
Enter Input : regeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility
Enter Input : may be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
Enter Input : complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondage
Enter Input : and not to freedom.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners, had
Enter Input : been in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.
Enter Input : He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul.
Enter Input : Alyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and let
Enter Input : him wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no
Enter Input : obligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days.
Enter Input : Though he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different
Enter Input : from others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination
Enter Input : was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that so
Enter Input : many people had for years past come to confess their sins to Father
Enter Input : Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he had
Enter Input : acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a
Enter Input : new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his conscience. He
Enter Input : sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of
Enter Input : their secrets before they had spoken a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first
Enter Input : time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy
Enter Input : faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was
Enter Input : not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks
Enter Input : used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the
Enter Input : greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the
Enter Input : end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
Enter Input : were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of
Enter Input : great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks
Enter Input : distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the
Enter Input : majority were on Father Zossima’s side and very many of them loved him
Enter Input : with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically
Enter Input : devoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint,
Enter Input : that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near,
Enter Input : they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the
Enter Input : immediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the
Enter Input : miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the
Enter Input : story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with
Enter Input : sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and
Enter Input : to pray over them, return shortly after—some the next day—and, falling in
Enter Input : tears at the elder’s feet, thank him for healing their sick.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural
Enter Input : course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for
Enter Input : he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in
Enter Input : his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His heart
Enter Input : throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out to
Enter Input : the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the
Enter Input : humbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to see
Enter Input : the elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissed
Enter Input : his feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the women
Enter Input : held up their children to him and brought him the sick “possessed with
Enter Input : devils.” The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed
Enter Input : them, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks of
Enter Input : illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrims
Enter Input : waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder why
Enter Input : they loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotion
Enter Input : merely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of
Enter Input : the Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the
Enter Input : everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world’s, it was
Enter Input : the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall
Enter Input : down before and worship.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere on
Enter Input : earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows the
Enter Input : truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us,
Enter Input : too, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. He
Enter Input : understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian of
Enter Input : God’s truth—of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the
Enter Input : sick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction that
Enter Input : after his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery
Enter Input : was even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind
Enter Input : of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart.
Enter Input : He was not at all troubled at this elder’s standing as a solitary example
Enter Input : before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal for
Enter Input : all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and all
Enter Input : men will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich nor
Enter Input : poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, and
Enter Input : the true Kingdom of Christ will come.” That was the dream in Alyosha’s
Enter Input : heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then, seemed
Enter Input : to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made friends with
Enter Input : his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than with his own
Enter Input : brother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but when
Enter Input : the latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairly
Enter Input : often, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he
Enter Input : seemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his
Enter Input : brother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
Enter Input : curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyosha
Enter Input : noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother’s indifference
Enter Input : at first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wondered
Enter Input : whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some
Enter Input : other cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was
Enter Input : absorbed in something—something inward and important—that he was striving
Enter Input : towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he
Enter Input : had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some
Enter Input : contempt on the part of the learned atheist for him—a foolish novice. He
Enter Input : knew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take
Enter Input : offense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment
Enter Input : which he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come
Enter Input : nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and
Enter Input : with a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of
Enter Input : the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
Enter Input : bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri’s enthusiastic references to
Enter Input : Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha’s eyes since Dmitri was, compared
Enter Input : with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in
Enter Input : personality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more
Enter Input : unlike.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members
Enter Input : of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had
Enter Input : such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gathering
Enter Input : was a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and
Enter Input : his father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become
Enter Input : insufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to
Enter Input : suggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima’s
Enter Input : cell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might
Enter Input : more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of
Enter Input : the elder’s presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally
Enter Input : supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretly
Enter Input : blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several
Enter Input : recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he was
Enter Input : not, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other end
Enter Input : of the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was staying
Enter Input : in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the
Enter Input : forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by
Enter Input : boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with
Enter Input : the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the
Enter Input : monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the
Enter Input : Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with
Enter Input : such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and
Enter Input : consideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from
Enter Input : within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had
Enter Input : scarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his
Enter Input : ordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was
Enter Input : fixed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who has made me a judge over them?” was all he said, smilingly, to
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the
Enter Input : wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the
Enter Input : interview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives,
Enter Input : perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and
Enter Input : Miüsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his
Enter Input : father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said
Enter Input : nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was
Enter Input : far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with
Enter Input : a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the family
Enter Input : discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety concerned the elder. He
Enter Input : trembled for him, for his glory, and dreaded any affront to him,
Enter Input : especially the refined, courteous irony of Miüsov and the supercilious
Enter Input : half-utterances of the highly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture on
Enter Input : warning the elder, telling him something about them, but, on second
Enter Input : thoughts, said nothing. He only sent word the day before, through a
Enter Input : friend, to his brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep
Enter Input : his promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had
Enter Input : promised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let
Enter Input : himself be provoked “by vileness,” but that, although he had a deep
Enter Input : respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that the
Enter Input : meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respect
Enter Input : to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,” he wrote in conclusion.
Enter Input : Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.

Enter Input : Book II. An Unfortunate Gathering
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with the
Enter Input : elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass.
Enter Input : Our visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it was
Enter Input : over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove
Enter Input : up with Miüsov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty,
Enter Input : called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter the
Enter Input : university. Miüsov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to
Enter Input : persuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young
Enter Input : man was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was
Enter Input : nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixity
Enter Input : in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he would
Enter Input : sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and rather
Enter Input : awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he became
Enter Input : talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But his
Enter Input : animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and even
Enter Input : elaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and
Enter Input : expectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old
Enter Input : pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Miüsov’s carriage, came Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been
Enter Input : informed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriage
Enter Input : at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the
Enter Input : monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever
Enter Input : seen the monastery, and Miüsov had probably not even been to church for
Enter Input : thirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumed
Enter Input : ease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these too
Enter Input : were ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the
Enter Input : monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church,
Enter Input : bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few of
Enter Input : higher rank—two or three ladies and a very old general. They were all
Enter Input : staying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, but
Enter Input : none of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took a
Enter Input : ten-copeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed—God knows
Enter Input : why!—hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: “Divide it equally.” None
Enter Input : of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to be
Enter Input : embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they
Enter Input : were not received with special honor, though one of them had recently made
Enter Input : a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy and
Enter Input : highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense
Enter Input : dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their
Enter Input : fishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Miüsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and was
Enter Input : on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty
Enter Input : penny for the right of lying in this “holy place,” but refrained. His
Enter Input : liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out,
Enter Input : for time is passing,” he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating
Enter Input : little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, he
Enter Input : introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula. He
Enter Input : at once entered into our visitors’ difficulty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from the
Enter Input : monastery, the other side of the copse.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know it’s the other side of the copse,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : “but we don’t remember the way. It is a long time since we’ve been here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Come
Enter Input : with me, won’t you? I’ll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself.
Enter Input : This way, this way.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man of
Enter Input : sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, with
Enter Input : an incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out of
Enter Input : his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,” observed
Enter Input : Miüsov severely. “That personage has granted us an audience, so to speak,
Enter Input : and so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you to
Enter Input : accompany us.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been there. I’ve been already; _un chevalier parfait_,” and Maximov
Enter Input : snapped his fingers in the air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is a _chevalier_?” asked Miüsov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the
Enter Input : monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk of
Enter Input : medium height, wearing a monk’s cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : and Miüsov stopped.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after
Enter Input : your visit to the hermitage. At one o’clock, not later. And you also,” he
Enter Input : added, addressing Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That I certainly will, without fail,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely
Enter Input : delighted at the invitation. “And, believe me, we’ve all given our word to
Enter Input : behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here?
Enter Input : The only obstacle to me is your company....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It would be a capital thing if he didn’t turn up. Do you suppose I like
Enter Input : all this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner.
Enter Input : Thank the Father Superior,” he said to the monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,” answered the monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If so I’ll go straight to the Father Superior—to the Father Superior,”
Enter Input : babbled Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please—” the monk
Enter Input : hesitated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Impertinent old man!” Miüsov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to
Enter Input : the monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s like von Sohn,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Have
Enter Input : you ever seen von Sohn?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve seen his portrait. It’s not the features, but something indefinable.
Enter Input : He’s a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave
Enter Input : properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin
Enter Input : to play the fool I don’t intend to be associated with you here.... You see
Enter Input : what a man he is”—he turned to the monk—“I’m afraid to go among decent
Enter Input : people with him.” A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to
Enter Input : the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and was
Enter Input : evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. Miüsov frowned more than
Enter Input : ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, and
Enter Input : nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,” flashed through
Enter Input : Miüsov’s mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here’s the hermitage. We’ve arrived,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “The gates
Enter Input : are shut.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above
Enter Input : and on the sides of the gates.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitage
Enter Input : there are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, and
Enter Input : eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That’s what is
Enter Input : remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives
Enter Input : ladies,” he remarked suddenly to the monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting.
Enter Input : But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the
Enter Input : portico, but outside the precincts—you can see the windows—and the elder
Enter Input : goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They are
Enter Input : always outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,
Enter Input : waiting there now with her sick daughter. Probably he has promised to come
Enter Input : out to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown
Enter Input : himself even to the people.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage to
Enter Input : the ladies. Don’t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do you
Enter Input : know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but no
Enter Input : creature of the female sex—no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. They’ll
Enter Input : turn you out when I’m gone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I’m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,” he cried
Enter Input : suddenly, stepping within the precincts, “what a vale of roses they live
Enter Input : in!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautiful
Enter Input : autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidently
Enter Input : tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, and
Enter Input : between the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived
Enter Input : was also surrounded with flowers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didn’t
Enter Input : care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladies
Enter Input : with a stick,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great deal
Enter Input : that’s told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,” answered the monk.
Enter Input : “Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behave
Enter Input : properly or I will pay you out!” Miüsov had time to mutter again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t think why you are so agitated,” Fyodor Pavlovitch observed
Enter Input : sarcastically. “Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell by
Enter Input : one’s eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their
Enter Input : opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I’m surprised at you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to come
Enter Input : in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to
Enter Input : quarrel—and lower myself and my ideas,” he reflected.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. The Old Buffoon
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in
Enter Input : from his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, two
Enter Input : monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other Father
Enter Input : Païssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though not
Enter Input : old. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty,
Enter Input : standing in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh
Enter Input : face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary
Enter Input : dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of the
Enter Input : monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,
Enter Input : reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an
Enter Input : equality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks
Enter Input : rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their
Enter Input : fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as
Enter Input : deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was
Enter Input : performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an
Enter Input : everyday rite. But Miüsov fancied that it was all done with intentional
Enter Input : impressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought—he had
Enter Input : reflected upon it the evening before—from simple politeness, since it was
Enter Input : the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder’s blessing, even if
Enter Input : he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on
Enter Input : the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified
Enter Input : gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a
Enter Input : chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Miüsov like an ape. Ivan
Enter Input : bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his
Enter Input : sides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The
Enter Input : elder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again,
Enter Input : asked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha’s cheeks. He was
Enter Input : ashamed. His forebodings were coming true.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, covered
Enter Input : with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite
Enter Input : wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monks
Enter Input : sat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student,
Enter Input : the novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large and
Enter Input : had a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture,
Enter Input : of coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window,
Enter Input : and a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon
Enter Input : of the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures in
Enter Input : shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic
Enter Input : cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign
Enter Input : engravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to these
Enter Input : costly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints
Enter Input : of saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the
Enter Input : fairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and
Enter Input : present.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Miüsov took a cursory glance at all these “conventional” surroundings and
Enter Input : bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his own
Enter Input : insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which a
Enter Input : clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking
Enter Input : himself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima.
Enter Input : There was, indeed, something in the elder’s face which many people besides
Enter Input : Miüsov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very
Enter Input : weak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years
Enter Input : older. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,
Enter Input : particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,
Enter Input : quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of gray
Enter Input : hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and his
Enter Input : lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads. His nose was
Enter Input : not long, but sharp, like a bird’s beak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,” thought
Enter Input : Miüsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to
Enter Input : begin the conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Precisely to our time,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “but no sign of my son,
Enter Input : Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!” (Alyosha shuddered all over at
Enter Input : “sacred elder.”) “I am always punctual myself, minute for minute,
Enter Input : remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you are not a king, anyway,” Miüsov muttered, losing his
Enter Input : self-restraint at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; that’s true. I’m not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say the
Enter Input : wrong thing. Your reverence,” he cried, with sudden pathos, “you behold
Enter Input : before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. It’s an old
Enter Input : habit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it’s with an
Enter Input : object, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. One
Enter Input : must be agreeable, mustn’t one? I was seven years ago in a little town
Enter Input : where I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We
Enter Input : went to the captain of police because we had to see him about something,
Enter Input : and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, the
Enter Input : most dangerous type in such cases. It’s their liver. I went straight up to
Enter Input : him, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, ‘Mr. Ispravnik,’
Enter Input : said I, ‘be our Napravnik.’ ‘What do you mean by Napravnik?’ said he. I
Enter Input : saw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there so
Enter Input : glum. ‘I wanted to make a joke,’ said I, ‘for the general diversion, as
Enter Input : Mr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we
Enter Input : need for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.’ And I
Enter Input : explained my comparison very reasonably, didn’t I? ‘Excuse me,’ said he,
Enter Input : ‘I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.’ He
Enter Input : turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, ‘Yes, yes, you are an
Enter Input : Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘since you called me a
Enter Input : Napravnik I am one.’ And would you believe it, it ruined our business! And
Enter Input : I’m always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with my
Enter Input : politeness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: ‘Your
Enter Input : wife is a ticklish lady,’ in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities,
Enter Input : so to speak. But he asked me, ‘Why, have you tickled her?’ I thought I’d
Enter Input : be polite, so I couldn’t help saying, ‘Yes,’ and he gave me a fine
Enter Input : tickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I’m not ashamed to
Enter Input : tell the story. I’m always injuring myself like that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re doing it now,” muttered Miüsov, with disgust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon as
Enter Input : I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you’d be the first
Enter Input : to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn’t coming off, your
Enter Input : reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower
Enter Input : jaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That’s been so since I was young,
Enter Input : when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen’s families. I am an
Enter Input : inveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it’s as
Enter Input : though it were a craze in me. I dare say it’s a devil within me. But only
Enter Input : a little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But
Enter Input : not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you’re not a lodging worth having
Enter Input : either. But I do believe—I believe in God, though I have had doubts of
Enter Input : late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I’m like the philosopher,
Enter Input : Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot
Enter Input : went to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?
Enter Input : He went in and said straight out, ‘There is no God.’ To which the great
Enter Input : bishop lifted up his finger and answered, ‘The fool hath said in his heart
Enter Input : there is no God.’ And he fell down at his feet on the spot. ‘I believe,’
Enter Input : he cried, ‘and will be christened.’ And so he was. Princess Dashkov was
Enter Input : his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you’re telling lies and
Enter Input : that that stupid anecdote isn’t true. Why are you playing the fool?” cried
Enter Input : Miüsov in a shaking voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I suspected all my life that it wasn’t true,” Fyodor Pavlovitch cried
Enter Input : with conviction. “But I’ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great
Enter Input : elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot’s christening I made up
Enter Input : just now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I
Enter Input : play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though I
Enter Input : really don’t know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot,
Enter Input : I heard as far as ‘the fool hath said in his heart’ twenty times from the
Enter Input : gentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that the
Enter Input : infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan
Enter Input : Platon....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Miüsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, and
Enter Input : conscious of being ridiculous.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty or
Enter Input : fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had entered
Enter Input : that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every one
Enter Input : admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Many
Enter Input : remained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had been
Enter Input : men of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted by
Enter Input : curiosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence
Enter Input : and delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on the
Enter Input : one side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to
Enter Input : decide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed
Enter Input : and bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with
Enter Input : unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the
Enter Input : elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Miüsov.
Enter Input : Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed to
Enter Input : him strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he had
Enter Input : rested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that he
Enter Input : could have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes,
Enter Input : apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had
Enter Input : nothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the
Enter Input : divinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the
Enter Input : monastery knew Rakitin’s thoughts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me,” began Miüsov, addressing Father Zossima, “for perhaps I seem
Enter Input : to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in believing
Enter Input : that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on a
Enter Input : visit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I should have to
Enter Input : apologize simply for having come with him....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room,
Enter Input : overwhelmed with confusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t distress yourself, I beg.” The elder got on to his feeble legs, and
Enter Input : taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again. “I beg
Enter Input : you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest.” And
Enter Input : with a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?” Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as though
Enter Input : ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,”
Enter Input : the elder said impressively. “Do not trouble. Make yourself quite at home.
Enter Input : And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root
Enter Input : of it all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I
Enter Input : accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, you’d better not
Enter Input : invite me to be my natural self. Don’t risk it.... I will not go so far as
Enter Input : that myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged
Enter Input : in the mists of uncertainty, though there are people who’d be pleased to
Enter Input : describe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for
Enter Input : you, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, “Blessed be the womb that
Enter Input : bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck—the paps especially. When you
Enter Input : said just now, ‘Don’t be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root
Enter Input : of it all,’ you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me to
Enter Input : the core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than
Enter Input : all, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, ‘Let me really
Enter Input : play the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one
Enter Input : of you worse than I am.’ That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame,
Enter Input : great elder, from shame; it’s simply over-sensitiveness that makes me
Enter Input : rowdy. If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the
Enter Input : kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have been
Enter Input : then! Teacher!” he fell suddenly on his knees, “what must I do to gain
Enter Input : eternal life?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough:
Enter Input : don’t give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don’t give way
Enter Input : to sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. And close your
Enter Input : taverns. If you can’t close all, at least two or three. And, above
Enter Input : all—don’t lie.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You mean about Diderot?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not about Diderot. Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies
Enter Input : to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot
Enter Input : distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect
Enter Input : for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and
Enter Input : in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to
Enter Input : passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all
Enter Input : from continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to
Enter Input : himself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimes
Enter Input : very pleasant to take offense, isn’t it? A man may know that nobody has
Enter Input : insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied
Enter Input : and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a
Enter Input : mountain out of a molehill—he knows that himself, yet he will be the first
Enter Input : to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great
Enter Input : pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit
Enter Input : down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder’s
Enter Input : thin hand. “It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well,
Enter Input : as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking offense,
Enter Input : to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not so
Enter Input : much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted—that you had
Enter Input : forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a note of that.
Enter Input : But I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day and
Enter Input : hour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though I
Enter Input : believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say,
Enter Input : the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may
Enter Input : sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a
Enter Input : word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had
Enter Input : been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to
Enter Input : find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me.
Enter Input : Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told
Enter Input : somewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his
Enter Input : faith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his
Enter Input : head, and, ‘courteously kissing it,’ walked a long way, carrying it in his
Enter Input : hands. Is that true or not, honored Father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it is untrue,” said the elder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint
Enter Input : do you say the story is told of?” asked the Father Librarian.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can’t tell. I was deceived.
Enter Input : I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch Miüsov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it
Enter Input : was who told the story.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It
Enter Input : was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you
Enter Input : shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I went
Enter Input : home with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shaken
Enter Input : ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall.
Enter Input : That was not a Diderot!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clear
Enter Input : to every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet Miüsov was stung
Enter Input : by his words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,” he muttered. “I may really have
Enter Input : told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself. I
Enter Input : heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at our mass
Enter Input : from the _Lives of the Saints_ ... he was a very learned man who had made
Enter Input : a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in
Enter Input : Russia.... I have not read the _Lives of the Saints_ myself, and I am not
Enter Input : going to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinner—we were
Enter Input : dining then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!” said Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, mimicking him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do I care for your faith?” Miüsov was on the point of shouting, but
Enter Input : he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, “You defile
Enter Input : everything you touch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder suddenly rose from his seat. “Excuse me, gentlemen, for leaving
Enter Input : you a few minutes,” he said, addressing all his guests. “I have visitors
Enter Input : awaiting me who arrived before you. But don’t you tell lies all the same,”
Enter Input : he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He went
Enter Input : out of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps.
Enter Input : Alyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too,
Enter Input : that the elder was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going
Enter Input : towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Blessed man!” he cried, with feeling. “Allow me to kiss your hand once
Enter Input : more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think
Enter Input : I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting
Enter Input : like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all
Enter Input : the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my
Enter Input : humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one
Enter Input : can get on with you! But now, I’ll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the
Enter Input : time. I’ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak,
Enter Input : Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now—for ten
Enter Input : minutes.”

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct,
Enter Input : there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told that
Enter Input : the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in
Enter Input : anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come
Enter Input : out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it
Enter Input : set aside for women of rank.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and always
Enter Input : dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. She
Enter Input : was not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow. Her
Enter Input : daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The poor child had
Enter Input : not been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in a
Enter Input : long reclining chair. She had a charming little face, rather thin from
Enter Input : illness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark
Enter Input : eyes with their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her
Enter Input : abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by
Enter Input : business connected with their estate. They had been staying a week in our
Enter Input : town, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, but
Enter Input : had visited Father Zossima once already, three days before. Though they
Enter Input : knew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned up
Enter Input : again, and urgently entreated “the happiness of looking once again on the
Enter Input : great healer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter’s invalid
Enter Input : carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of our
Enter Input : monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north.
Enter Input : He too sought the elder’s blessing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the
Enter Input : peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into
Enter Input : the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and
Enter Input : began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led
Enter Input : up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking
Enter Input : and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her
Enter Input : forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and
Enter Input : quieted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to
Enter Input : see and hear these “possessed” women in the villages and monasteries. They
Enter Input : used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that
Enter Input : they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in
Enter Input : and they were led up to it, at once the “possession” ceased, and the sick
Enter Input : women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed
Enter Input : at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my
Enter Input : town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that
Enter Input : it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told
Enter Input : to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical
Enter Input : specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible
Enter Input : illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in
Enter Input : Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a
Enter Input : disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard,
Enter Input : abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery,
Enter Input : from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like
Enter Input : others. The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling
Enter Input : woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been
Enter Input : explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the “clericals,”
Enter Input : arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported
Enter Input : her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that
Enter Input : the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman
Enter Input : were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, with
Enter Input : a nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the
Enter Input : whole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the
Enter Input : moment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the
Enter Input : miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and
Enter Input : it did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same now
Enter Input : as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the
Enter Input : effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, others
Enter Input : cried out in sing-song voices.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The “possessed” woman he
Enter Input : knew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery,
Enter Input : and had been brought to him before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But here is one from afar.” He pointed to a woman by no means old but
Enter Input : very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened
Enter Input : by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder;
Enter Input : there was something almost frenzied in her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here.
Enter Input : From afar off, Father, from afar off!” the woman began in a sing-song
Enter Input : voice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head from side to
Enter Input : side with her cheek resting in her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the
Enter Input : peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief
Enter Input : that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent
Enter Input : in wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter a
Enter Input : grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart
Enter Input : still more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense
Enter Input : of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to
Enter Input : reopen the wound.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are of the tradesman class?” said Father Zossima, looking curiously
Enter Input : at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live in
Enter Input : the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father, we
Enter Input : heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a
Enter Input : pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, ‘Go,
Enter Input : Nastasya, go to them’—that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at the
Enter Input : service, and to-day I have come to you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you weeping for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s my little son I’m grieving for, Father. He was three years old—three
Enter Input : years all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I’m in anguish, for
Enter Input : my little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and
Enter Input : now we’ve no children, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the first
Enter Input : three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can’t
Enter Input : forget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He has
Enter Input : withered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his
Enter Input : little boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his
Enter Input : little things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, ‘Let
Enter Input : me go on a pilgrimage, master.’ He is a driver. We’re not poor people,
Enter Input : Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It’s all our own, the horse and
Enter Input : the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun
Enter Input : drinking while I am away. He’s sure to. It used to be so before. As soon
Enter Input : as I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I don’t think about him.
Enter Input : It’s three months since I left home. I’ve forgotten him. I’ve forgotten
Enter Input : everything. I don’t want to remember. And what would our life be now
Enter Input : together? I’ve done with him, I’ve done. I’ve done with them all. I don’t
Enter Input : care to look upon my house and my goods. I don’t care to see anything at
Enter Input : all!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, mother,” said the elder. “Once in olden times a holy saint saw in
Enter Input : the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only one,
Enter Input : whom God had taken. ‘Knowest thou not,’ said the saint to her, ‘how bold
Enter Input : these little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there are none
Enter Input : bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. “Thou didst give us life, O
Enter Input : Lord,” they say, “and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take
Enter Input : it back again.” And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them
Enter Input : at once the rank of angels. Therefore,’ said the saint, ‘thou, too, O
Enter Input : mother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the
Enter Input : fellowship of the angels.’ That’s what the saint said to the weeping
Enter Input : mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely.
Enter Input : Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before the
Enter Input : throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, and
Enter Input : therefore weep not, but rejoice.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. She
Enter Input : sighed deeply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. ‘Foolish one,’
Enter Input : he said, ‘why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before
Enter Input : God.’ He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he cries like
Enter Input : me. ‘I know, Nikita,’ said I. ‘Where could he be if not with the Lord God?
Enter Input : Only, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before.’ And
Enter Input : if only I could look upon him one little time, if only I could peep at him
Enter Input : one little time, without going up to him, without speaking, if I could be
Enter Input : hidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him
Enter Input : playing in the yard, calling in his little voice, ‘Mammy, where are you?’
Enter Input : If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room
Enter Input : just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used to run
Enter Input : to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet I should
Enter Input : know him! But he’s gone, Father, he’s gone, and I shall never hear him
Enter Input : again. Here’s his little sash, but him I shall never see or hear now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She drew out of her bosom her boy’s little embroidered sash, and as soon
Enter Input : as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes with her
Enter Input : fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is Rachel of old,” said the elder, “weeping for her children, and will
Enter Input : not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on earth for
Enter Input : you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep and
Enter Input : be not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep be sure to
Enter Input : remember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looks
Enter Input : down from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and
Enter Input : points at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that
Enter Input : great mother’s grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your
Enter Input : bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart
Enter Input : and delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child’s
Enter Input : soul. What was his name?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey, Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in my
Enter Input : prayers, and I will pray for your husband’s health. It is a sin for you to
Enter Input : leave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his
Enter Input : father, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his happiness? He is
Enter Input : living, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is not in the house he
Enter Input : is near you, unseen. How can he go into the house when you say that the
Enter Input : house is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together,
Enter Input : his father and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But
Enter Input : then he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this
Enter Input : very day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You’ve gone straight to my
Enter Input : heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,” the woman began in a
Enter Input : sing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very old
Enter Input : woman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes
Enter Input : showed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something.
Enter Input : She said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close
Enter Input : by in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had
Enter Input : gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now a
Enter Input : year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him, but she
Enter Input : did not know the proper place to inquire.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna—she’s a rich merchant’s wife—said
Enter Input : to me, ‘You go, Prohorovna, and put your son’s name down for prayer in the
Enter Input : church, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead. His
Enter Input : soul will be troubled,’ she said, ‘and he will write you a letter.’ And
Enter Input : Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many
Enter Input : times tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or
Enter Input : false, and would it be right?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t think of it. It’s shameful to ask the question. How is it possible
Enter Input : to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother too! It’s a
Enter Input : great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you.
Enter Input : Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for his
Enter Input : good health, and that she may forgive you for your error. And another
Enter Input : thing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you,
Enter Input : your son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in
Enter Input : peace. Your son is alive, I tell you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us and
Enter Input : for our sins!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon
Enter Input : him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman was
Enter Input : gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid to
Enter Input : approach.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it, my child?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Absolve my soul, Father,” she articulated softly, and slowly sank on her
Enter Input : knees and bowed down at his feet. “I have sinned, Father. I am afraid of
Enter Input : my sin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him, still
Enter Input : on her knees.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am a widow these three years,” she began in a half-whisper, with a sort
Enter Input : of shudder. “I had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man. He used
Enter Input : to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he were to
Enter Input : get well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the thought came
Enter Input : to me—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay!” said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to
Enter Input : catch anything. She had soon done.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three years ago?” asked the elder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three years. At first I didn’t think about it, but now I’ve begun to be
Enter Input : ill, and the thought never leaves me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you come from far?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Over three hundred miles away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you told it in confession?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you been admitted to Communion?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don’t fret. If only your penitence
Enter Input : fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there can be no sin
Enter Input : on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant!
Enter Input : Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God.
Enter Input : Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of
Enter Input : repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe
Enter Input : that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your
Enter Input : sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner
Enter Input : there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not.
Enter Input : Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the
Enter Input : dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in
Enter Input : truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All
Enter Input : things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even
Enter Input : as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will
Enter Input : God. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world
Enter Input : by it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a little
Enter Input : ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny
Enter Input : baby in her arms.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From Vyshegorye, dear Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve come to look at you. I have been to you before—or have you
Enter Input : forgotten? You’ve no great memory if you’ve forgotten me. They told us you
Enter Input : were ill. Thinks I, I’ll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, and
Enter Input : you’re not ill! You’ll live another twenty years. God bless you! There are
Enter Input : plenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thank you for all, daughter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty
Enter Input : copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought as
Enter Input : I came along, better give through him. He’ll know whom to give to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so
Enter Input : certainly. Is that your little girl?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You have
Enter Input : gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He blessed them all and bowed low to them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. A Lady Of Little Faith
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the peasants and
Enter Input : his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with her
Enter Input : handkerchief. She was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good
Enter Input : disposition in many respects. When the elder went up to her at last she
Enter Input : met him enthusiastically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...” She
Enter Input : could not go on for emotion. “Oh, I understand the people’s love for you.
Enter Input : I love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could help loving
Enter Input : them, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How is your daughter’s health? You wanted to talk to me again?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it! I was
Enter Input : ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until
Enter Input : you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express our ardent
Enter Input : gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely by
Enter Input : praying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We have
Enter Input : hastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our
Enter Input : homage.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her chair.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,” said the
Enter Input : lady with nervous haste. “And that’s not all. Her legs are stronger. This
Enter Input : morning she got up well; she had slept all night. Look at her rosy cheeks,
Enter Input : her bright eyes! She used to be always crying, but now she laughs and is
Enter Input : gay and happy. This morning she insisted on my letting her stand up, and
Enter Input : she stood up for a whole minute without any support. She wagers that in a
Enter Input : fortnight she’ll be dancing a quadrille. I’ve called in Doctor
Enter Input : Herzenstube. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘I am amazed; I can make
Enter Input : nothing of it.’ And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not
Enter Input : fly here to thank you? Lise, thank him—thank him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise’s pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She rose in
Enter Input : her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder, clasped her hands
Enter Input : before him, but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s at him,” she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation at
Enter Input : herself for not being able to repress her mirth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, he
Enter Input : would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant. His
Enter Input : eyes shone and he looked down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?” the mother
Enter Input : went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha. The
Enter Input : latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way, held
Enter Input : out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.” She handed him a little
Enter Input : note. “She particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible;
Enter Input : that you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?” Alyosha muttered in great
Enter Input : astonishment. His face at once looked anxious. “Oh, it’s all to do with
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch and—what has happened lately,” the mother explained
Enter Input : hurriedly. “Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see you
Enter Input : about it.... Why, of course, I can’t say. But she wants to see you at
Enter Input : once. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have only seen her once,” Alyosha protested with the same perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her
Enter Input : suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring now!
Enter Input : Think what awaits her! It’s all terrible, terrible!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well, I will come,” Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the
Enter Input : brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would
Enter Input : come, without any sort of explanation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!” cried Lise with sudden
Enter Input : animation. “I told mamma you’d be sure not to go. I said you were saving
Enter Input : your soul. How splendid you are! I’ve always thought you were splendid.
Enter Input : How glad I am to tell you so!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise!” said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had said
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said; “you never
Enter Input : come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except
Enter Input : with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled
Enter Input : without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He had
Enter Input : begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his
Enter Input : entrance by Lise’s chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that is
Enter Input : of the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in
Enter Input : his own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from the far
Enter Input : north, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor
Enter Input : monastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing
Enter Input : and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can you presume to do such deeds?” the monk asked suddenly, pointing
Enter Input : solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her “healing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete cure,
Enter Input : and may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing,
Enter Input : it is by no power but God’s will. It’s all from God. Visit me, Father,” he
Enter Input : added to the monk. “It’s not often I can see visitors. I am ill, and I
Enter Input : know that my days are numbered.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, long
Enter Input : time yet,” cried the lady. “And in what way are you ill? You look so well,
Enter Input : so gay and happy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it’s only for a
Enter Input : moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to you,
Enter Input : you could never say anything that would please me so much. For men are
Enter Input : made for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to say
Enter Input : to himself, ‘I am doing God’s will on earth.’ All the righteous, all the
Enter Input : saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!” cried the lady. “You seem
Enter Input : to pierce with your words. And yet—happiness, happiness—where is it? Who
Enter Input : can say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you have been so good as to
Enter Input : let us see you once more to-day, let me tell you what I could not utter
Enter Input : last time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and have been for so
Enter Input : long! I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From what specially?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I suffer ... from lack of faith.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lack of faith in God?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life—it is such
Enter Input : an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You are a healer, you
Enter Input : are deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare not expect you
Enter Input : to believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of honor that I am not
Enter Input : speaking lightly now. The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts
Enter Input : me to anguish, to terror. And I don’t know to whom to appeal, and have not
Enter Input : dared to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God! What
Enter Input : will you think of me now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She clasped her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t distress yourself about my opinion of you,” said the elder. “I
Enter Input : quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself if
Enter Input : every one has faith, where did it come from? And then they do say that it
Enter Input : all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and that none
Enter Input : of it’s real. And I say to myself, ‘What if I’ve been believing all my
Enter Input : life, and when I come to die there’s nothing but the burdocks growing on
Enter Input : my grave?’ as I read in some author. It’s awful! How—how can I get back my
Enter Input : faith? But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically,
Enter Input : without thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come now
Enter Input : to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this chance
Enter Input : slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can I
Enter Input : convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me and see
Enter Input : that scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his head about it, and
Enter Input : I’m the only one who can’t stand it. It’s deadly—deadly!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No doubt. But there’s no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor actively
Enter Input : and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of
Enter Input : the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to
Enter Input : perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will
Enter Input : believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has
Enter Input : been tried. This is certain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In active love? There’s another question—and such a question! You see, I
Enter Input : so love humanity that—would you believe it?—I often dream of forsaking all
Enter Input : that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy. I close my eyes
Enter Input : and think and dream, and at that moment I feel full of strength to
Enter Input : overcome all obstacles. No wounds, no festering sores could at that moment
Enter Input : frighten me. I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would
Enter Input : nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not
Enter Input : others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?” the lady went on
Enter Input : fervently, almost frantically. “That’s the chief question—that’s my most
Enter Input : agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, ‘Would you persevere
Enter Input : long on that path? And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not
Enter Input : meet you with gratitude, but worried you with his whims, without valuing
Enter Input : or remarking your charitable services, began abusing you and rudely
Enter Input : commanding you, and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which
Enter Input : often happens when people are in great suffering)—what then? Would you
Enter Input : persevere in your love, or not?’ And do you know, I came with horror to
Enter Input : the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity, it
Enter Input : would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant, I expect my payment
Enter Input : at once—that is, praise, and the repayment of love with love. Otherwise I
Enter Input : am incapable of loving any one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding, she
Enter Input : looked with defiant resolution at the elder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s just the same story as a doctor once told me,” observed the elder.
Enter Input : “He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as
Enter Input : frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. ‘I love humanity,’ he
Enter Input : said, ‘but I wonder at myself. The more I love humanity in general, the
Enter Input : less I love man in particular. In my dreams,’ he said, ‘I have often come
Enter Input : to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I
Enter Input : might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary;
Enter Input : and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two
Enter Input : days together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me, his
Enter Input : personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. In
Enter Input : twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he’s too
Enter Input : long over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing
Enter Input : his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But
Enter Input : it has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more
Enter Input : ardent becomes my love for humanity.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what’s to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one despair?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and it
Enter Input : will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you since you can so
Enter Input : deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have been talking to me so
Enter Input : sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did from
Enter Input : me just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in the
Enter Input : achievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and your
Enter Input : whole life will slip away like a phantom. In that case you will naturally
Enter Input : cease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer
Enter Input : after a fashion in the end.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that I was
Enter Input : really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you I
Enter Input : could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to myself. You have
Enter Input : seen through me and explained me to myself!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I believe
Enter Input : that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not attain happiness,
Enter Input : always remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it.
Enter Input : Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness
Enter Input : to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every
Enter Input : hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself.
Enter Input : What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of
Enter Input : your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the
Enter Input : consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own
Enter Input : faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don’t be frightened overmuch even at
Enter Input : your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for
Enter Input : love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.
Enter Input : Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in
Enter Input : the sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does
Enter Input : not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as
Enter Input : though on the stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some
Enter Input : people too, perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you
Enter Input : see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther
Enter Input : from your goal instead of nearer to it—at that very moment I predict that
Enter Input : you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who
Enter Input : has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you. Forgive me for
Enter Input : not being able to stay longer with you. They are waiting for me. Good-by.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The lady was weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise, Lise! Bless her—bless her!” she cried, starting up suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness all along,”
Enter Input : the elder said jestingly. “Why have you been laughing at Alexey?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time. She had
Enter Input : noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her, and she
Enter Input : found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to catch his eye.
Enter Input : Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was irresistibly and
Enter Input : suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she smiled triumphantly in
Enter Input : his face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed. At last he turned
Enter Input : away from her altogether and hid behind the elder’s back. After a few
Enter Input : minutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he turned again to see
Enter Input : whether he was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out
Enter Input : of her chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look.
Enter Input : Catching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying,
Enter Input : “Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed and her
Enter Input : face became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and nervously in a
Enter Input : warm and resentful voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me about when I
Enter Input : was little. We used to play together. He used to come to teach me to read,
Enter Input : do you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he would never
Enter Input : forget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he’s
Enter Input : afraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn’t he want to
Enter Input : come near me? Why doesn’t he talk? Why won’t he come and see us? It’s not
Enter Input : that you won’t let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It’s not good
Enter Input : manners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought of it first, if he
Enter Input : hasn’t forgotten me. No, now he’s saving his soul! Why have you put that
Enter Input : long gown on him? If he runs he’ll fall.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible,
Enter Input : prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a
Enter Input : smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly
Enter Input : pressed it to her eyes and began crying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be angry with me. I’m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps
Enter Input : Alyosha’s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a
Enter Input : ridiculous girl.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will certainly send him,” said the elder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder’s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five
Enter Input : minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account
Enter Input : they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be
Enter Input : forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests
Enter Input : engaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks took the leading
Enter Input : share in it. Miüsov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently very
Enter Input : eagerly, in the conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was
Enter Input : evidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with neglect,
Enter Input : which increased his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
Enter Input : Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showed
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is
Enter Input : progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,”
Enter Input : he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be quiet, had
Enter Input : actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his neighbor Miüsov with
Enter Input : an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his discomfiture. He had been
Enter Input : waiting for some time to pay off old scores, and now he could not let the
Enter Input : opportunity slip. Bending over his shoulder he began teasing him again in
Enter Input : a whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why didn’t you go away just now, after the ‘courteously kissing’? Why did
Enter Input : you consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you felt
Enter Input : insulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by showing
Enter Input : off your intelligence. Now you won’t go till you’ve displayed your
Enter Input : intellect to them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You again?... On the contrary, I’m just going.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll be the last, the last of all to go!” Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
Enter Input : him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossima’s return.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself in
Enter Input : his former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting them to
Enter Input : go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his face, saw that he was
Enter Input : fearfully exhausted and making a great effort. Of late he had been liable
Enter Input : to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face had the pallor that was common
Enter Input : before such attacks, and his lips were white. But he evidently did not
Enter Input : want to break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of his
Enter Input : own in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are discussing this gentleman’s most interesting article,” said Father
Enter Input : Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. “He
Enter Input : brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways.
Enter Input : It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical
Enter Input : authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of
Enter Input : its jurisdiction.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m sorry I have not read your article, but I’ve heard of it,” said the
Enter Input : elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He takes up a most interesting position,” continued the Father Librarian.
Enter Input : “As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed
Enter Input : to the separation of Church from State.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s interesting. But in what sense?” Father Zossima asked Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had
Enter Input : feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently
Enter Input : without the slightest _arrière-pensée_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of
Enter Input : the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for
Enter Input : ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and
Enter Input : that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even
Enter Input : normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it.
Enter Input : Compromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for
Enter Input : instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.
Enter Input : My clerical opponent maintains that the Church holds a precise and defined
Enter Input : position in the State. I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church ought
Enter Input : to include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and,
Enter Input : if this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in
Enter Input : reality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the future
Enter Input : development of Christian society!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perfectly true,” Father Païssy, the silent and learned monk, assented
Enter Input : with fervor and decision.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The purest Ultramontanism!” cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing and
Enter Input : recrossing his legs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, well, we have no mountains,” cried Father Iosif, and turning to the
Enter Input : elder he continued: “Observe the answer he makes to the following
Enter Input : ‘fundamental and essential’ propositions of his opponent, who is, you must
Enter Input : note, an ecclesiastic. First, that ‘no social organization can or ought to
Enter Input : arrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights of
Enter Input : its members.’ Secondly, that ‘criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to
Enter Input : belong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as a
Enter Input : divine institution and as an organization of men for religious objects,’
Enter Input : and, finally, in the third place, ‘the Church is a kingdom not of this
Enter Input : world.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!” Father Païssy could
Enter Input : not refrain from breaking in again. “I have read the book which you have
Enter Input : answered,” he added, addressing Ivan, “and was astounded at the words ‘the
Enter Input : Church is a kingdom not of this world.’ If it is not of this world, then
Enter Input : it cannot exist on earth at all. In the Gospel, the words ‘not of this
Enter Input : world’ are not used in that sense. To play with such words is
Enter Input : indefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth.
Enter Input : The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but
Enter Input : it is only entered through the Church which has been founded and
Enter Input : established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a
Enter Input : connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, a
Enter Input : kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the
Enter Input : kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine promise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After listening
Enter Input : attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder with
Enter Input : perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first
Enter Input : three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and was
Enter Input : nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to become
Enter Input : Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it included
Enter Input : the Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments. In
Enter Input : reality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of
Enter Input : the pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects
Enter Input : and fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering
Enter Input : into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental
Enter Input : principles—the rock on which it stands—and could pursue no other aims than
Enter Input : those which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them
Enter Input : that of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State
Enter Input : itself, into the Church. In that way (that is, with a view to the future)
Enter Input : it is not the Church that should seek a definite position in the State,
Enter Input : like ‘every social organization,’ or as ‘an organization of men for
Enter Input : religious purposes’ (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the
Enter Input : contrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completely
Enter Input : transformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a Church,
Enter Input : rejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this
Enter Input : will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great
Enter Input : State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false,
Enter Input : still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone
Enter Input : leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the book _On the
Enter Input : Foundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged correctly if, in
Enter Input : seeking and laying down those foundations, he had looked upon them as a
Enter Input : temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days. But as
Enter Input : soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he
Enter Input : predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the
Enter Input : permanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he is going directly
Enter Input : against the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist
Enter Input : of my article.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That is, in brief,” Father Païssy began again, laying stress on each
Enter Input : word, “according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the
Enter Input : nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, as
Enter Input : though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as to
Enter Input : disappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, and
Enter Input : civilization. And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will
Enter Input : be set apart for her in the State, and even that under control—and this
Enter Input : will be so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopes
Enter Input : and conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower
Enter Input : into a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State
Enter Input : should end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else. So
Enter Input : be it! So be it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I confess you’ve reassured me somewhat,” Miüsov said smiling, again
Enter Input : crossing his legs. “So far as I understand, then, the realization of such
Enter Input : an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ. That’s as
Enter Input : you please. It’s a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war,
Enter Input : diplomacy, banks, and so on—something after the fashion of socialism,
Enter Input : indeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that the
Enter Input : Church might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence them to
Enter Input : beating, prison, and even death.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would not
Enter Input : even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the way of
Enter Input : regarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, but
Enter Input : fairly soon,” Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you serious?” Miüsov glanced keenly at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the
Enter Input : criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,” Ivan went
Enter Input : on. “I ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut off
Enter Input : then not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he would
Enter Input : have transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ.
Enter Input : This is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly
Enter Input : enunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to-day compromises with
Enter Input : his conscience: ‘I steal,’ he says, ‘but I don’t go against the Church.
Enter Input : I’m not an enemy of Christ.’ That’s what the criminal of to-day is
Enter Input : continually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the
Enter Input : State it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over
Enter Input : the world, to say: ‘All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are
Enter Input : the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian
Enter Input : Church.’ It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires a
Enter Input : rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, take
Enter Input : the Church’s own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present
Enter Input : almost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its
Enter Input : tainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, into
Enter Input : completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man,
Enter Input : of his reformation and salvation?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean? I fail to understand again,” Miüsov interrupted. “Some
Enter Input : sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible. What
Enter Input : is excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I suspect you are simply
Enter Input : amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,” said the elder suddenly, and
Enter Input : all turned to him at once. “If it were not for the Church of Christ there
Enter Input : would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no real
Enter Input : chastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical
Enter Input : punishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only
Enter Input : embitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one,
Enter Input : the only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin
Enter Input : by conscience.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How is that, may one inquire?” asked Miüsov, with lively curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why,” began the elder, “all these sentences to exile with hard labor, and
Enter Input : formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what’s more, deter hardly
Enter Input : a single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish but is
Enter Input : continually on the increase. You must admit that. Consequently the
Enter Input : security of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious member
Enter Input : is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another criminal
Enter Input : always comes to take his place at once, and often two of them. If anything
Enter Input : does preserve society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform
Enter Input : the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience. It
Enter Input : is only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian
Enter Input : society—that is, of the Church—that he recognizes his sin against
Enter Input : society—that is, against the Church. So that it is only against the
Enter Input : Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day can
Enter Input : recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,
Enter Input : then it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to
Enter Input : itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the power of
Enter Input : moral condemnation, withdraws of her own accord from punishing the
Enter Input : criminal actively. She does not excommunicate him but simply persists in
Enter Input : motherly exhortation of him. What is more, the Church even tries to
Enter Input : preserve all Christian communion with the criminal. She admits him to
Enter Input : church services, to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him
Enter Input : more as a captive than as a convict. And what would become of the
Enter Input : criminal, O Lord, if even the Christian society—that is, the Church—were
Enter Input : to reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off? What
Enter Input : would become of him if the Church punished him with her excommunication as
Enter Input : the direct consequence of the secular law? There could be no more terrible
Enter Input : despair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still have
Enter Input : faith. Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen,
Enter Input : perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then
Enter Input : what would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother,
Enter Input : holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely
Enter Input : punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one to
Enter Input : have pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgment
Enter Input : is the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practically
Enter Input : and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary
Enter Input : compromise. She can enter into no compact about that. The foreign
Enter Input : criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to-day
Enter Input : confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction
Enter Input : against an unjustly oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a
Enter Input : force that triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of
Enter Input : themselves in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred,
Enter Input : forgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate
Enter Input : of the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the
Enter Input : compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are no
Enter Input : churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid church
Enter Input : buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass
Enter Input : from Church into State and to disappear in it completely. So it seems at
Enter Input : least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was proclaimed a State
Enter Input : instead of a Church a thousand years ago. And so the criminal is no longer
Enter Input : conscious of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If he
Enter Input : returns to society, often it is with such hatred that society itself
Enter Input : instinctively cuts him off. You can judge for yourself how it must end. In
Enter Input : many cases it would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is
Enter Input : that besides the established law courts we have the Church too, which
Enter Input : always keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious
Enter Input : son. And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought,
Enter Input : the judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice is
Enter Input : still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively
Enter Input : recognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said here just now is
Enter Input : true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introduced
Enter Input : in practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the society were
Enter Input : changed into the Church, not only the judgment of the Church would have
Enter Input : influence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, but
Enter Input : possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished. And
Enter Input : there can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the
Enter Input : crime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in
Enter Input : restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in
Enter Input : regenerating the fallen. It is true,” said Father Zossima, with a smile,
Enter Input : “the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven
Enter Input : righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will continue still
Enter Input : unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society
Enter Input : almost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful
Enter Input : Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for it is
Enter Input : ordained to come to pass! And there is no need to be troubled about times
Enter Input : and seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of
Enter Input : God, in His foresight, and His love. And what in human reckoning seems
Enter Input : still afar off, may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve
Enter Input : of its appearance. And so be it, so be it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So be it, so be it!” Father Païssy repeated austerely and reverently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Strange, extremely strange!” Miüsov pronounced, not so much with heat as
Enter Input : with latent indignation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What strikes you as so strange?” Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, it’s beyond anything!” cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking out; “the
Enter Input : State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the State.
Enter Input : It’s not simply Ultramontanism, it’s arch-Ultramontanism! It’s beyond the
Enter Input : dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are completely misunderstanding it,” said Father Païssy sternly.
Enter Input : “Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State. That is
Enter Input : Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. On the
Enter Input : contrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and become
Enter Input : a Church over the whole world—which is the complete opposite of
Enter Input : Ultramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the glorious
Enter Input : destiny ordained for the Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the
Enter Input : east!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Miüsov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary
Enter Input : personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile played on his
Enter Input : lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart. The whole
Enter Input : conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced casually at Rakitin, who
Enter Input : was standing immovable in his place by the door listening and watching
Enter Input : intently though with downcast eyes. But from the color in his cheeks
Enter Input : Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he knew
Enter Input : what caused his excitement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,” Miüsov said
Enter Input : impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. “Some years ago, soon after
Enter Input : the _coup d’état_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an
Enter Input : extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very
Enter Input : interesting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a
Enter Input : detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of
Enter Input : political detectives—a rather powerful position in its own way. I was
Enter Input : prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him.
Enter Input : And as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing
Enter Input : a special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, he
Enter Input : deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course.
Enter Input : He was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,
Enter Input : especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The subject
Enter Input : was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I will
Enter Input : quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. ‘We are not
Enter Input : particularly afraid,’ said he, ‘of all these socialists, anarchists,
Enter Input : infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all their
Enter Input : goings on. But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God
Enter Input : and are Christians, but at the same time are socialists. These are the
Enter Input : people we are most afraid of. They are dreadful people! The socialist who
Enter Input : is a Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.’
Enter Input : The words struck me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to
Enter Input : me here, gentlemen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?” Father Païssy
Enter Input : asked directly, without beating about the bush.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the door
Enter Input : opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in. They
Enter Input : had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden appearance caused
Enter Input : some surprise for a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height and
Enter Input : agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was muscular, and
Enter Input : showed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was something
Enter Input : not healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and
Enter Input : there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His rather large,
Enter Input : prominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet
Enter Input : there was a vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking
Enter Input : irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed
Enter Input : something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. “It’s
Enter Input : hard to tell what he’s thinking,” those who talked to him sometimes
Enter Input : declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes were
Enter Input : startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful and
Enter Input : light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so gloomy. A
Enter Input : certain strained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment.
Enter Input : Every one knew, or had heard of, the extremely restless and dissipated
Enter Input : life which he had been leading of late, as well as of the violent anger to
Enter Input : which he had been roused in his quarrels with his father. There were
Enter Input : several stories current in the town about it. It is true that he was
Enter Input : irascible by nature, “of an unstable and unbalanced mind,” as our justice
Enter Input : of the peace, Katchalnikov, happily described him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned
Enter Input : frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat. Having only lately
Enter Input : left the army, he still had mustaches and no beard. His dark brown hair
Enter Input : was cropped short, and combed forward on his temples. He had the long,
Enter Input : determined stride of a military man. He stood still for a moment on the
Enter Input : threshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder,
Enter Input : guessing him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his
Enter Input : blessing. Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed
Enter Input : his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long, but
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my inquiries, told
Enter Input : me twice over that the appointment was for one. Now I suddenly learn—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t disturb yourself,” interposed the elder. “No matter. You are a
Enter Input : little late. It’s of no consequence....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your goodness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards his
Enter Input : father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful bow. He had
Enter Input : evidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all seriousness,
Enter Input : thinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to the
Enter Input : occasion. In response to Dmitri’s bow he jumped up from his chair and made
Enter Input : his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly solemn and
Enter Input : impressive, which gave him a positively malignant look. Dmitri bowed
Enter Input : generally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with his
Enter Input : long, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near Father
Enter Input : Païssy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he
Enter Input : had interrupted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri’s entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the conversation
Enter Input : was resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary to reply to
Enter Input : Father Païssy’s persistent and almost irritable question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,” he observed with a certain
Enter Input : well-bred nonchalance. “It’s a subtle question, too. Here Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting to say
Enter Input : about that also. Ask him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing special, except one little remark,” Ivan replied at once.
Enter Input : “European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often mix
Enter Input : up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity. This wild
Enter Input : notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it’s not only Liberals
Enter Input : and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases,
Enter Input : it appears, the police—the foreign police, of course—do the same. Your
Enter Input : Paris anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,” Miüsov repeated.
Enter Input : “I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and rather
Enter Input : characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself. Only five days ago,
Enter Input : in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he solemnly declared in
Enter Input : argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their
Enter Input : neighbors. That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind,
Enter Input : and that, if there had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing
Enter Input : to a natural law, but simply because men have believed in immortality.
Enter Input : Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in
Enter Input : that faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in
Enter Input : immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of
Enter Input : the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then would be
Enter Input : immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism. That’s not all. He
Enter Input : ended by asserting that for every individual, like ourselves, who does not
Enter Input : believe in God or immortality, the moral law of nature must immediately be
Enter Input : changed into the exact contrary of the former religious law, and that
Enter Input : egoism, even to crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized as
Enter Input : the inevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position.
Enter Input : From this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric
Enter Input : and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch’s theories.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me,” Dmitri cried suddenly; “if I’ve heard aright, crime must not
Enter Input : only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the most
Enter Input : rational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is that so or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite so,” said Father Païssy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll remember it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he had
Enter Input : begun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
Enter Input : disappearance of the faith in immortality?” the elder asked Ivan suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no
Enter Input : immortality.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why unhappy?” Ivan asked smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Because, in all probability you don’t believe yourself in the immortality
Enter Input : of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your article on
Enter Input : Church jurisdiction.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn’t altogether joking,” Ivan suddenly
Enter Input : and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You were not altogether joking. That’s true. The question is still
Enter Input : fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes sometimes to
Enter Input : divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair
Enter Input : itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself with
Enter Input : magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don’t believe
Enter Input : your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....
Enter Input : That question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it
Enter Input : clamors for an answer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?” Ivan went on
Enter Input : asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable
Enter Input : smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If it can’t be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided in
Enter Input : the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and all
Enter Input : its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who has given you a
Enter Input : lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higher
Enter Input : things, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God grant that your heart will
Enter Input : attain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross over
Enter Input : Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his seat, went up to
Enter Input : him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand went back to his place in
Enter Input : silence. His face looked firm and earnest. This action and all the
Enter Input : preceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan, impressed every
Enter Input : one by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that all were silent
Enter Input : for a moment, and there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyosha’s
Enter Input : face. But Miüsov suddenly shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Most pious and holy elder,” he cried, pointing to Ivan, “that is my son,
Enter Input : flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most dutiful Karl
Enter Input : Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri, against
Enter Input : whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz Moor—they are
Enter Input : both out of Schiller’s _Robbers_, and so I am the reigning Count von Moor!
Enter Input : Judge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak without buffoonery, and don’t begin by insulting the members of
Enter Input : your family,” answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He was
Enter Input : obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!” cried Dmitri
Enter Input : indignantly. He too leapt up. “Forgive it, reverend Father,” he added,
Enter Input : addressing the elder. “I am not a cultivated man, and I don’t even know
Enter Input : how to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have been
Enter Input : too good-natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is a
Enter Input : scandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive. But
Enter Input : I believe I know why—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They all blame me, all of them!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn.
Enter Input : “Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch, you have!” he turned suddenly to Miüsov, although the
Enter Input : latter was not dreaming of interrupting him. “They all accuse me of having
Enter Input : hidden the children’s money in my boots, and cheated them, but isn’t there
Enter Input : a court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : from your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money you
Enter Input : had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left. Why does Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him.
Enter Input : Because they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to
Enter Input : me, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentary
Enter Input : proof. The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was
Enter Input : stationed before, he several times spent a thousand or two for the
Enter Input : seduction of some respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, in its most secret details. I’ll prove it.... Would you
Enter Input : believe it, holy Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable
Enter Input : of young ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,
Enter Input : formerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and had the
Enter Input : Anna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by his promise of
Enter Input : marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed to him, yet
Enter Input : before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress.
Enter Input : And although this enchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriage
Enter Input : with a respectable man, yet she is of an independent character, an
Enter Input : unapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wife—for she is
Enter Input : virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to
Enter Input : open this fortress with a golden key, and that’s why he is insolent to me
Enter Input : now, trying to get money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this
Enter Input : enchantress already. He’s continually borrowing money for the purpose.
Enter Input : From whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be silent!” cried Dmitri, “wait till I’m gone. Don’t dare in my presence
Enter Input : to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you should utter a
Enter Input : word about her is an outrage, and I won’t permit it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya! Mitya!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a
Enter Input : tear. “And is your father’s blessing nothing to you? If I curse you, what
Enter Input : then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shameless hypocrite!” exclaimed Dmitri furiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with others?
Enter Input : Gentlemen, only fancy; there’s a poor but honorable man living here,
Enter Input : burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and was
Enter Input : discharged from the army, but not publicly, not by court-martial, with no
Enter Input : slur on his honor. And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in
Enter Input : a tavern, dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly, and all
Enter Input : because he is an agent in a little business of mine.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all a lie! Outwardly it’s the truth, but inwardly a lie!” Dmitri was
Enter Input : trembling with rage. “Father, I don’t justify my action. Yes, I confess it
Enter Input : publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I regret it now, and
Enter Input : I’m disgusted with myself for my brutal rage. But this captain, this agent
Enter Input : of yours, went to that lady whom you call an enchantress, and suggested to
Enter Input : her from you, that she should take I.O.U.’s of mine which were in your
Enter Input : possession, and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by
Enter Input : means of them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my
Enter Input : property. Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you
Enter Input : yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face.... She
Enter Input : told me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to put me in prison
Enter Input : because you are jealous of me with her, because you’d begun to force your
Enter Input : attentions upon her; and I know all about that, too; she laughed at you
Enter Input : for that as well—you hear—she laughed at you as she described it. So here
Enter Input : you have this man, this father who reproaches his profligate son!
Enter Input : Gentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would
Enter Input : only bring you together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if
Enter Input : he held out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has
Enter Input : just this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady, for
Enter Input : whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in vain, I have
Enter Input : made up my mind to show up his game, though he is my father....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed with
Enter Input : difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except Father
Enter Input : Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere but
Enter Input : waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale, not from
Enter Input : excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring smile lighted up
Enter Input : his face; from time to time he raised his hand, as though to check the
Enter Input : storm, and, of course, a gesture from him would have been enough to end
Enter Input : the scene; but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched them
Enter Input : intently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectly
Enter Input : clear to him. At last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,” he said hotly. “But I did
Enter Input : not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal. This
Enter Input : must be stopped at once! Believe me, your reverence, I had no precise
Enter Input : knowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was unwilling to
Enter Input : believe them, and I learn for the first time.... A father is jealous of
Enter Input : his son’s relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the
Enter Input : creature to get his son into prison! This is the company in which I have
Enter Input : been forced to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was
Enter Input : as much deceived as any one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an unnatural
Enter Input : voice, “if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a
Enter Input : duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a handkerchief,” he
Enter Input : ended, stamping with both feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when
Enter Input : they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears
Enter Input : of emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later,
Enter Input : they are able to whisper to themselves, “You know you are lying, you
Enter Input : shameless old sinner! You’re acting now, in spite of your ‘holy’ wrath.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at his
Enter Input : father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thought ... I thought,” he said, in a soft and, as it were, controlled
Enter Input : voice, “that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart,
Enter Input : my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find nothing but a depraved
Enter Input : profligate, a despicable clown!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A duel!” yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at each
Enter Input : syllable. “And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me tell you that
Enter Input : there has never been in all your family a loftier, and more honest—you
Enter Input : hear—more honest woman than this ‘creature,’ as you have dared to call
Enter Input : her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for that
Enter Input : ‘creature,’ so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldn’t
Enter Input : hold a candle to her. That’s the woman called a ‘creature’!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shameful!” broke from Father Iosif.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shameful and disgraceful!” Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a boyish
Enter Input : voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till that moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why is such a man alive?” Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in a
Enter Input : hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed.
Enter Input : “Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?” He looked round
Enter Input : at every one and pointed at the old man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : rushing up to Father Iosif. “That’s the answer to your ‘shameful!’ What is
Enter Input : shameful? That ‘creature,’ that ‘woman of loose behavior’ is perhaps
Enter Input : holier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation! She
Enter Input : fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved much,
Enter Input : and Christ himself forgave the woman ‘who loved much.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was not for such love Christ forgave her,” broke impatiently from the
Enter Input : gentle Father Iosif.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here, eating
Enter Input : cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and you
Enter Input : think you bribe God with gudgeon.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is unendurable!” was heard on all sides in the cell.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way. Father
Enter Input : Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with anxiety for
Enter Input : the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supporting
Enter Input : him by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank
Enter Input : on his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness,
Enter Input : but this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at
Enter Input : Dmitri’s feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so
Enter Input : astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a
Enter Input : faint smile on his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!” he said, bowing on all sides to his
Enter Input : guests.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him—what did
Enter Input : it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, “Oh, God!” hid his face in his hands,
Enter Input : and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after him, in their
Enter Input : confusion not saying good-by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks went
Enter Input : up to him again for a blessing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic or
Enter Input : what?” said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen
Enter Input : conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They were
Enter Input : all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t answer for a madhouse and for madmen,” Miüsov answered at once
Enter Input : ill-humoredly, “but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : and, trust me, for ever. Where’s that monk?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That monk,” that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with the
Enter Input : Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came down
Enter Input : the steps from the elder’s cell, as though he had been waiting for them
Enter Input : all the time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest respect to the
Enter Input : Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov, to his reverence,
Enter Input : telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances I
Enter Input : am unable to have the honor of being present at his table, greatly as I
Enter Input : should desire to do so,” Miüsov said irritably to the monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,” Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch cut in immediately. “Do you hear, Father; this gentleman
Enter Input : doesn’t want to remain in my company or else he’d come at once. And you
Enter Input : shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and good
Enter Input : appetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home, I’ll eat at
Enter Input : home, I don’t feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable
Enter Input : relative.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible man!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim the
Enter Input : relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling.
Enter Input : I’ll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan, stay if you like.
Enter Input : I’ll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires you to go to the
Enter Input : Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to apologize for the disturbance
Enter Input : we’ve been making....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it true that you are going home? Aren’t you lying?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what’s happened! Forgive me,
Enter Input : gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And, indeed, I am
Enter Input : ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon and
Enter Input : another the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog
Enter Input : Fido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to
Enter Input : gobble up the monastery’s sauces? I am ashamed, I can’t. You must excuse
Enter Input : me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?” thought Miüsov, still
Enter Input : hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes. The
Enter Input : latter turned round, and noticing that Miüsov was watching him, waved him
Enter Input : a kiss.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, are you coming to the Superior?” Miüsov asked Ivan abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner,”
Enter Input : said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact that the
Enter Input : monk was listening. “We ought, at least, to apologize for the disturbance,
Enter Input : and explain that it was not our doing. What do you think?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, we must explain that it wasn’t our doing. Besides, father won’t be
Enter Input : there,” observed Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On the road
Enter Input : through the copse he made one observation however—that the Father Superior
Enter Input : had been waiting a long time, and that they were more than half an hour
Enter Input : late. He received no answer. Miüsov looked with hatred at Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,” he
Enter Input : thought. “A brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!”
Enter Input :

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed. It
Enter Input : was a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrow
Enter Input : iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the corner, under
Enter Input : the ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The
Enter Input : elder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard.
Enter Input : He looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are needed
Enter Input : there, go and wait at the Father Superior’s table.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me stay here,” Alyosha entreated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be
Enter Input : of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, my
Enter Input : son”—the elder liked to call him that—“this is not the place for you in
Enter Input : the future. When it is God’s will to call me, leave the monastery. Go away
Enter Input : for good.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha started.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great
Enter Input : service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have
Enter Input : to take a wife, too. You will have to bear _all_ before you come back.
Enter Input : There will be much to do. But I don’t doubt of you, and so I send you
Enter Input : forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you.
Enter Input : You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is
Enter Input : my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.
Enter Input : Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only my
Enter Input : days but my hours are numbered.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha’s face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouth
Enter Input : quivered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it again?” Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. “The worldly may
Enter Input : follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who is
Enter Input : departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go, and
Enter Input : make haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make no
Enter Input : protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover, to
Enter Input : ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tip
Enter Input : of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder would have
Enter Input : explained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it was not his
Enter Input : will. That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed
Enter Input : blindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in
Enter Input : time to serve at the Father Superior’s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at
Enter Input : his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima’s
Enter Input : words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly
Enter Input : must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how
Enter Input : could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing
Enter Input : him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the
Enter Input : monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He
Enter Input : hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage,
Enter Input : and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient
Enter Input : pines beside the path. He had not far to go—about five hundred paces. He
Enter Input : expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he
Enter Input : noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you waiting for me?” asked Alyosha, overtaking him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” grinned Rakitin. “You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know;
Enter Input : he has a banquet. There’s not been such a banquet since the Superior
Enter Input : entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shan’t be
Enter Input : there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what
Enter Input : does that vision mean? That’s what I want to ask you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What vision?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn’t he tap the ground with
Enter Input : his forehead, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You speak of Father Zossima?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of Father Zossima.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tapped the ground?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that
Enter Input : vision mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know what it means, Misha.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I knew he wouldn’t explain it to you! There’s nothing wonderful about it,
Enter Input : of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the
Enter Input : performance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it and
Enter Input : spread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To my
Enter Input : thinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your
Enter Input : house stinks of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What crime?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’ll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your rich
Enter Input : old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn
Enter Input : up. If something happens later on, it’ll be: ‘Ah, the holy man foresaw it,
Enter Input : prophesied it!’ though it’s a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.
Enter Input : ‘Ah, but it was symbolic,’ they’ll say, ‘an allegory,’ and the devil knows
Enter Input : what all! It’ll be remembered to his glory: ‘He predicted the crime and
Enter Input : marked the criminal!’ That’s always the way with these crazy fanatics;
Enter Input : they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like
Enter Input : your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a
Enter Input : murderer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What murderer? As though you didn’t know! I’ll bet you’ve thought of it
Enter Input : before. That’s interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you always
Enter Input : speak the truth, though you’re always between two stools. Have you thought
Enter Input : of it or not? Answer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have,” answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? Have you really?” he cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ... I’ve not exactly thought it,” muttered Alyosha, “but directly you
Enter Input : began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and your
Enter Input : brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then I’m not mistaken?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But wait, wait a minute,” Alyosha broke in uneasily. “What has led you to
Enter Input : see all this? Why does it interest you? That’s the first question.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I’ll deal with them separately.
Enter Input : What led me to see it? I shouldn’t have seen it, if I hadn’t suddenly
Enter Input : understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him all
Enter Input : at once. I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest but
Enter Input : passionate people have a line which mustn’t be crossed. If it were, he’d
Enter Input : run at your father with a knife. But your father’s a drunken and abandoned
Enter Input : old sinner, who can never draw the line—if they both let themselves go,
Enter Input : they’ll both come to grief.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Misha, no. If that’s all, you’ve reassured me. It won’t come to
Enter Input : that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our Mitya
Enter Input : (he is stupid, but honest), but he’s—a sensualist. That’s the very
Enter Input : definition and inner essence of him. It’s your father has handed him on
Enter Input : his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you, Alyosha, how you
Enter Input : can have kept your purity. You’re a Karamazov too, you know! In your
Enter Input : family sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these three
Enter Input : sensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts.
Enter Input : The three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be the
Enter Input : fourth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri—despises her,” said Alyosha,
Enter Input : with a sort of shudder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn’t despise her. Since he has openly
Enter Input : abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn’t despise her. There’s something
Enter Input : here, my dear boy, that you don’t understand yet. A man will fall in love
Enter Input : with some beauty, with a woman’s body, or even with a part of a woman’s
Enter Input : body (a sensualist can understand that), and he’ll abandon his own
Enter Input : children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia,
Enter Input : too. If he’s honest, he’ll steal; if he’s humane, he’ll murder; if he’s
Enter Input : faithful, he’ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women’s feet, sung of their
Enter Input : feet in his verse. Others don’t sing their praises, but they can’t look at
Enter Input : their feet without a thrill—and it’s not only their feet. Contempt’s no
Enter Input : help here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
Enter Input : can’t tear himself away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand that,” Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the
Enter Input : first word,” said Rakitin, malignantly. “That escaped you unawares, and
Enter Input : the confession’s the more precious. So it’s a familiar subject; you’ve
Enter Input : thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul!
Enter Input : You’re a quiet one, Alyosha, you’re a saint, I know, but the devil only
Enter Input : knows what you’ve thought about, and what you know already! You are pure,
Enter Input : but you’ve been down into the depths.... I’ve been watching you a long
Enter Input : time. You’re a Karamazov yourself; you’re a thorough Karamazov—no doubt
Enter Input : birth and selection have something to answer for. You’re a sensualist from
Enter Input : your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do you tremble? Is it
Enter Input : true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along.
Enter Input : ‘I’ll pull off his cassock,’ she says. You can’t think how she keeps
Enter Input : begging me to bring you. I wondered why she took such an interest in you.
Enter Input : Do you know, she’s an extraordinary woman, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank her and say I’m not coming,” said Alyosha, with a strained smile.
Enter Input : “Finish what you were saying, Misha. I’ll tell you my idea after.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s nothing to finish. It’s all clear. It’s the same old tune,
Enter Input : brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Enter Input : Ivan? He’s a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is
Enter Input : that you’re all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan writes
Enter Input : theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his own,
Enter Input : though he’s an atheist, and he admits it’s a fraud himself—that’s your
Enter Input : brother Ivan. He’s trying to get Mitya’s betrothed for himself, and I
Enter Input : fancy he’ll succeed, too. And what’s more, it’s with Mitya’s consent. For
Enter Input : Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to
Enter Input : Grushenka. And he’s ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and
Enter Input : disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
Enter Input : devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it!
Enter Input : Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mitya’s way
Enter Input : now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His mouth waters at the
Enter Input : sight of her. It’s simply on her account he made that scene in the cell
Enter Input : just now, simply because Miüsov called her an ‘abandoned creature.’ He’s
Enter Input : worse than a tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him in
Enter Input : connection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he
Enter Input : has suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
Enter Input : pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And they’ll
Enter Input : come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path! But
Enter Input : Grushenka favors neither of them, she’s still playing with them, and
Enter Input : teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of. For though
Enter Input : she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn’t marry her, and
Enter Input : maybe he’ll turn stingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. That’s where
Enter Input : Mitya’s value comes in; he has no money, but he’s ready to marry her. Yes,
Enter Input : ready to marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, who’s rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry
Enter Input : Grushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant,
Enter Input : Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict
Enter Input : may well come to pass from all this, and that’s what your brother Ivan is
Enter Input : waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He’ll carry off
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of
Enter Input : sixty thousand. That’s very alluring to start with, for a man of no
Enter Input : consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won’t be wronging Mitya, but
Enter Input : doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last
Enter Input : week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud
Enter Input : that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan,
Enter Input : he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
Enter Input : refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She’s hesitating between the two of
Enter Input : them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship
Enter Input : him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?” Alyosha asked
Enter Input : sharply, frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know
Enter Input : I’m speaking the truth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn’t be tempted by money.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It’s not only the money,
Enter Input : though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan is above that. He wouldn’t make up to any one for thousands. It is
Enter Input : not money, it’s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it’s suffering he is
Enter Input : seeking.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What wild dream now? Oh, you—aristocrats!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted
Enter Input : by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don’t want millions,
Enter Input : but an answer to their questions.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s plagiarism, Alyosha. You’re quoting your elder’s phrases. Ah, Ivan
Enter Input : has set you a problem!” cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice. His face
Enter Input : changed, and his lips twitched. “And the problem’s a stupid one. It is no
Enter Input : good guessing it. Rack your brains—you’ll understand it. His article is
Enter Input : absurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid theory just now: if
Enter Input : there’s no immortality of the soul, then there’s no virtue, and everything
Enter Input : is lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried
Enter Input : out: ‘I will remember!’) An attractive theory for scoundrels!—(I’m being
Enter Input : abusive, that’s stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic _poseurs_,
Enter Input : ‘haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.’ He’s showing off, and what it all
Enter Input : comes to is, ‘on the one hand we cannot but admit’ and ‘on the other it
Enter Input : must be confessed!’ His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in
Enter Input : itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality.
Enter Input : It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
Enter Input : though remembering something, he stopped short.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that’s enough,” he said, with a still more crooked smile. “Why are
Enter Input : you laughing? Do you think I’m a vulgar fool?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but ...
Enter Input : never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot about it,
Enter Input : Misha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna yourself; I’ve suspected that for a long time, brother, that’s
Enter Input : why you don’t like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And jealous of her money, too? Won’t you add that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivan
Enter Input : with you. Don’t you understand that one might very well dislike him, apart
Enter Input : from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? He
Enter Input : condescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven’t I a right to abuse him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He doesn’t
Enter Input : speak of you at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna’s he was
Enter Input : abusing me for all he was worth—you see what an interest he takes in your
Enter Input : humble servant. And which is the jealous one after that, brother, I can’t
Enter Input : say. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if I don’t go in for
Enter Input : the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and don’t become a
Enter Input : monk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid
Enter Input : magazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and in
Enter Input : the end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal
Enter Input : and atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of
Enter Input : socialism, but keeping a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in
Enter Input : with both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother’s
Enter Input : account, the tinge of socialism won’t hinder me from laying by the
Enter Input : proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the
Enter Input : end of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my
Enter Input : publishing offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
Enter Input : even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the Neva,
Enter Input : which they say is to be built in Petersburg.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Misha, that’s just what will really happen, every word of it,” cried
Enter Input : Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, I’m joking, forgive me. I’ve something quite different in my
Enter Input : mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You can’t have been
Enter Input : at Katerina Ivanovna’s yourself when he was talking about you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I wasn’t there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it with
Enter Input : my own ears; if you want to know, he didn’t tell me, but I overheard him,
Enter Input : unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in Grushenka’s bedroom and I
Enter Input : couldn’t go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, I’d forgotten she was a relation of yours.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!” cried Rakitin, turning
Enter Input : crimson. “Are you mad? You’re out of your mind!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, isn’t she a relation of yours? I heard so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient,
Enter Input : noble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon at
Enter Input : other men’s tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor. I may
Enter Input : be only a priest’s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but
Enter Input : don’t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too,
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn’t be a relation of Grushenka, a common
Enter Input : harlot. I beg you to understand that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin was intensely irritated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, for goodness’ sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you
Enter Input : call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?” Alyosha flushed
Enter Input : suddenly. “I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. You
Enter Input : often go to see her, and you told me yourself you’re not her lover. I
Enter Input : never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she
Enter Input : really deserve it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That’s not your business.
Enter Input : But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely
Enter Input : to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You’d better go to the
Enter Input : kitchen. Hullo! what’s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can’t have
Enter Input : finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No
Enter Input : doubt they have. Here’s your father and your brother Ivan after him.
Enter Input : They’ve broken out from the Father Superior’s. And look, Father Isidor’s
Enter Input : shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father’s
Enter Input : shouting and waving his arms. I expect he’s swearing. Bah, and there goes
Enter Input : Miüsov driving away in his carriage. You see, he’s going. And there’s old
Enter Input : Maximov running!—there must have been a row. There can’t have been any
Enter Input : dinner. Surely they’ve not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they,
Enter Input : perhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was reason for Rakitin’s exclamations. There had been a scandalous,
Enter Input : an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inward
Enter Input : qualms, when he reached the Father Superior’s with Ivan: he felt ashamed
Enter Input : of having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdained that
Enter Input : despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him
Enter Input : in Father Zossima’s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. “The monks
Enter Input : were not to blame, in any case,” he reflected, on the steps. “And if
Enter Input : they’re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
Enter Input : nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won’t argue, I’ll
Enter Input : fall in with everything, I’ll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
Enter Input : them that I’ve nothing to do with that Æsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot,
Enter Input : and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish
Enter Input : his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the more
Enter Input : ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he
Enter Input : had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father
Enter Input : Superior’s dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a
Enter Input : dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they
Enter Input : were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima’s. But
Enter Input : there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. The
Enter Input : furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned
Enter Input : style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining
Enter Input : with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the
Enter Input : most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the
Enter Input : beautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there
Enter Input : were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of
Enter Input : excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas—both the latter made in the
Enter Input : monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin
Enter Input : related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of
Enter Input : sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a
Enter Input : special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally,
Enter Input : blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could
Enter Input : not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He
Enter Input : had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of
Enter Input : an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable
Enter Input : abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he
Enter Input : would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to
Enter Input : him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and
Enter Input : quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that
Enter Input : because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the
Enter Input : highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced
Enter Input : him in that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invited
Enter Input : to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one other monk
Enter Input : were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were already waiting
Enter Input : when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a
Enter Input : little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of
Enter Input : the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous
Enter Input : old man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic
Enter Input : face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to
Enter Input : receive his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Enter Input : Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov
Enter Input : went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner,
Enter Input : kissing his hand as peasants do.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,” began Miüsov, simpering
Enter Input : affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. “Pardon us for
Enter Input : having come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He
Enter Input : felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not without
Enter Input : reason. In the reverend Father Zossima’s cell he was carried away by the
Enter Input : unhappy dissension with his son, and let fall words which were quite out
Enter Input : of keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ... as”—he glanced at the
Enter Input : monks—“your reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore,
Enter Input : recognizing that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame,
Enter Input : and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
Enter Input : apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
Enter Input : later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
Enter Input : place.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered his
Enter Input : self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation disappeared. He
Enter Input : fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight bend
Enter Input : of the head, replied:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have
Enter Input : learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent
Enter Input : their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with
Enter Input : peculiar fervor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It
Enter Input : must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt the
Enter Input : impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing
Enter Input : had happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elder’s cell. Not that
Enter Input : he was so very much ashamed of himself—quite the contrary perhaps. But
Enter Input : still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking
Enter Input : carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had
Enter Input : hardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own
Enter Input : words at the elder’s: “I always feel when I meet people that I am lower
Enter Input : than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
Enter Input : the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.” He
Enter Input : longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness. He
Enter Input : suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, “Why do you hate
Enter Input : so and so, so much?” And he had answered them, with his shameless
Enter Input : impudence, “I’ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a
Enter Input : dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for a
Enter Input : moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. “Well, since I
Enter Input : have begun, I may as well go on,” he decided. His predominant sensation at
Enter Input : that moment might be expressed in the following words, “Well, there is no
Enter Input : rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
Enter Input : show them I don’t care what they think—that’s all!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to the
Enter Input : monastery and straight to the Father Superior’s. He had no clear idea what
Enter Input : he would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that a
Enter Input : touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only to
Enter Input : obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be legally
Enter Input : punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had
Enter Input : marveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeared in the
Enter Input : Father Superior’s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and
Enter Input : all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the
Enter Input : company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
Enter Input : them all boldly in the face. “They thought I had gone, and here I am
Enter Input : again,” he cried to the whole room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once every
Enter Input : one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, was
Enter Input : about to happen. Miüsov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame
Enter Input : of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died
Enter Input : down in his heart revived instantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No! this I cannot endure!” he cried. “I absolutely cannot! and ... I
Enter Input : certainly cannot!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyond
Enter Input : thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it he cannot?” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “that he absolutely
Enter Input : cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will
Enter Input : you receive me as your guest?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are welcome with all my heart,” answered the Superior. “Gentlemen!”
Enter Input : he added, “I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your
Enter Input : dissensions, and to be united in love and family harmony—with prayer to
Enter Input : the Lord at our humble table.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, it is impossible!” cried Miüsov, beside himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for
Enter Input : me, and I won’t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
Enter Input : I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what
Enter Input : you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my
Enter Input : relation. That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn? Here’s von Sohn. How are you,
Enter Input : von Sohn?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you mean me?” muttered Maximov, puzzled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course I mean you,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “Who else? The Father
Enter Input : Superior could not be von Sohn.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It
Enter Input : was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry—I believe
Enter Input : that is what such places are called among you—he was killed and robbed,
Enter Input : and in spite of his venerable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from
Enter Input : Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing him
Enter Input : up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano.
Enter Input : So this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn’t he, von
Enter Input : Sohn?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is happening? What’s this?” voices were heard in the group of monks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let us go,” cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, excuse me,” Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another step
Enter Input : into the room. “Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me for
Enter Input : behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr
Enter Input : Alexandrovitch. Miüsov, my relation, prefers to have _plus de noblesse que
Enter Input : de sincérité_ in his words, but I prefer in mine _plus de sincérité que de
Enter Input : noblesse_, and—damn the _noblesse_! That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn?
Enter Input : Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet
Enter Input : I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of
Enter Input : honor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing
Enter Input : else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
Enter Input : Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and
Enter Input : it is my duty to care. While I’ve been playing the fool, I have been
Enter Input : listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the
Enter Input : last act of the performance. You know how things are with us? As a thing
Enter Input : falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever.
Enter Input : Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with
Enter Input : you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down
Enter Input : reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud.
Enter Input : Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
Enter Input : confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it
Enter Input : was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this
Enter Input : and that ... well, you understand what—sometimes it would not be proper to
Enter Input : talk about it—so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried
Enter Input : along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunity
Enter Input : I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak
Enter Input : spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached
Enter Input : the Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others where the
Enter Input : institution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the
Enter Input : elders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that the
Enter Input : elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on—absurd
Enter Input : charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of
Enter Input : folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the
Enter Input : current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
Enter Input : prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a
Enter Input : word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no
Enter Input : one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder’s cell, so that he
Enter Input : could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from
Enter Input : confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish
Enter Input : tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to
Enter Input : prove to his audience, and above all to himself, that he had not been
Enter Input : talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word
Enter Input : he would be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
Enter Input : and plunged forward blindly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How disgraceful!” cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Pardon me!” said the Father Superior. “It was said of old, ‘Many have
Enter Input : begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And
Enter Input : hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He
Enter Input : has sent it to heal my vain soul.’ And so we humbly thank you, honored
Enter Input : guest!” and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tut—tut—tut—sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old
Enter Input : gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. A
Enter Input : kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller’s _Robbers_. I
Enter Input : don’t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to
Enter Input : be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do
Enter Input : you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward
Enter Input : like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being
Enter Input : virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in
Enter Input : a monastery at other people’s expense, and without expecting a reward up
Enter Input : aloft for it—you’ll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father
Enter Input : Superior. What have they got here?” He went up to the table. “Old port
Enter Input : wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is
Enter Input : something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought
Enter Input : out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the
Enter Input : laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it
Enter Input : from his family and the tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy
Enter Input : fathers.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is too disgraceful!” said Father Iosif.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Païssy kept obstinately silent. Miüsov rushed from the room, and
Enter Input : Kalganov after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see
Enter Input : you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan’t come. I sent you a
Enter Input : thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No,
Enter Input : I’ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the
Enter Input : humiliation I endured.” He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm
Enter Input : of simulated feeling. “This monastery has played a great part in my life!
Enter Input : It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
Enter Input : against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me
Enter Input : all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the
Enter Input : age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles,
Enter Input : no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part
Enter Input : in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was
Enter Input : so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one moment
Enter Input : almost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But
Enter Input : at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke
Enter Input : impressively:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is written again, ‘Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh
Enter Input : upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who
Enter Input : hath dishonored thee.’ And so will we.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink
Enter Input : yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from
Enter Input : here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most
Enter Input : dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you
Enter Input : to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only
Enter Input : one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and
Enter Input : kasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I’ve
Enter Input : cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don’t lose your chance.” He went out,
Enter Input : shouting and gesticulating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey!” his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. “You
Enter Input : come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, and
Enter Input : leave no trace behind.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
Enter Input : Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was about
Enter Input : to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good-by to
Enter Input : Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque
Enter Input : buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly
Enter Input : appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being
Enter Input : too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was in such a hurry that
Enter Input : in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan’s left foot
Enter Input : was still resting, and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in.
Enter Input : “I am going with you!” he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh
Enter Input : with a look of reckless glee in his face. “Take me, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. “Did I not say he was von
Enter Input : Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear
Enter Input : yourself away? What did you _vonsohn_ there? And how could you get away
Enter Input : from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but
Enter Input : I am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It
Enter Input : will be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet,
Enter Input : von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von
Enter Input : Sohn!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a
Enter Input : violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance he
Enter Input : did not fall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Drive on!” Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?” Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch protested.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you are a fellow,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, “Why, it was you
Enter Input : got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Why
Enter Input : are you angry now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,” Ivan snapped
Enter Input : sullenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A drop of brandy would be nice now,” he observed sententiously, but Ivan
Enter Input : made no response.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You shall have some, too, when we get home.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan was still silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike
Enter Input : it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the
Enter Input : road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

Enter Input : Chapter I. In The Servants’ Quarters
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Karamazovs’ house was far from being in the center of the town, but it
Enter Input : was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old house of two
Enter Input : stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, and
Enter Input : might still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little
Enter Input : cupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. “One doesn’t feel so solitary
Enter Input : when one’s left alone in the evening,” he used to say. It was his habit to
Enter Input : send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up
Enter Input : alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was a
Enter Input : kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter
Enter Input : and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
Enter Input : house was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many,
Enter Input : with their servants. But at the time of our story there was no one living
Enter Input : in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodge
Enter Input : there were only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a
Enter Input : young man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Of
Enter Input : old Grigory we have said something already. He was firm and determined and
Enter Input : went blindly and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought
Enter Input : by any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that
Enter Input : it was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa
Enter Input : Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband’s will implicitly all her life, yet she
Enter Input : had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was set
Enter Input : on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with
Enter Input : their small savings. But Grigory decided then, once for all, that “the
Enter Input : woman’s talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,” and that they
Enter Input : ought not to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for “that was
Enter Input : now their duty.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you understand what duty is?” he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it’s our
Enter Input : duty to stay here I never shall understand,” Marfa answered firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, don’t understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your
Enter Input : tongue.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a
Enter Input : small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too, that he had
Enter Input : an indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and he was aware
Enter Input : of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though
Enter Input : his will was strong enough “in some of the affairs of life,” as he
Enter Input : expressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in
Enter Input : facing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of
Enter Input : them. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
Enter Input : that’s not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
Enter Input : trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory’s intervention,
Enter Input : and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But it
Enter Input : wasn’t only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were
Enter Input : graver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one
Enter Input : faithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
Enter Input : moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his
Enter Input : lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in
Enter Input : moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral
Enter Input : convulsion which took an almost physical form. “My soul’s simply quaking
Enter Input : in my throat at those times,” he used to say. At such moments he liked to
Enter Input : feel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a
Enter Input : strong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his
Enter Input : debauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to
Enter Input : overlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or
Enter Input : threaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in
Enter Input : case of need, to defend him—from whom? From somebody unknown, but terrible
Enter Input : and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was _another_ man, an
Enter Input : old and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely to
Enter Input : look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with
Enter Input : him. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he
Enter Input : were angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however)
Enter Input : that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
Enter Input : fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would
Enter Input : begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go
Enter Input : again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the
Enter Input : just. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on
Enter Input : Alyosha’s arrival. Alyosha “pierced his heart” by “living with him, seeing
Enter Input : everything and blaming nothing.” Moreover, Alyosha brought with him
Enter Input : something his father had never known before: a complete absence of
Enter Input : contempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural
Enter Input : unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was
Enter Input : a complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
Enter Input : ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till then
Enter Input : loved nothing but “evil.” When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to
Enter Input : himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to
Enter Input : learn.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaïda Ivanovna, the
Enter Input : first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he had,
Enter Input : on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor “crazy woman,” against
Enter Input : his master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His
Enter Input : sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him, so that
Enter Input : even now, twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to
Enter Input : her from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
Enter Input : Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words,
Enter Input : without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he
Enter Input : loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she knew
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
Enter Input : cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he in worldly
Enter Input : affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without question or
Enter Input : complaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for his spiritual
Enter Input : superiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the
Enter Input : course of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs. The
Enter Input : grave and dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone,
Enter Input : so that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did not
Enter Input : need her advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
Enter Input : it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once, and then
Enter Input : only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch’s marriage
Enter Input : with Adelaïda Ivanovna, the village girls and women—at that time
Enter Input : serfs—were called together before the house to sing and dance. They were
Enter Input : beginning “In the Green Meadows,” when Marfa, at that time a young woman,
Enter Input : skipped forward and danced “the Russian Dance,” not in the village
Enter Input : fashion, but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of
Enter Input : the rich Miüsov family, in their private theater, where the actors were
Enter Input : taught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wife
Enter Input : danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson,
Enter Input : pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was never
Enter Input : repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died.
Enter Input : Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. When
Enter Input : Adelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of three
Enter Input : years old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands, and
Enter Input : looked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan
Enter Input : and Alyosha, for which the general’s widow had rewarded him with a slap in
Enter Input : the face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his own
Enter Input : child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it
Enter Input : was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had six
Enter Input : fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only silent till
Enter Input : the day of the christening, but kept away in the garden. It was spring,
Enter Input : and he spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day was
Enter Input : fixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a
Enter Input : conclusion. Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the
Enter Input : visitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand
Enter Input : god-father, he suddenly announced that the baby “ought not to be
Enter Input : christened at all.” He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his
Enter Input : words, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not?” asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Because it’s a dragon,” muttered Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A dragon? What dragon?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory did not speak for some time. “It’s a confusion of nature,” he
Enter Input : muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayed
Enter Input : earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child remained
Enter Input : unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sickly
Enter Input : infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, and
Enter Input : for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of a
Enter Input : fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its
Enter Input : little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling
Enter Input : up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the
Enter Input : earth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfa
Enter Input : speak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, she
Enter Input : never spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day of
Enter Input : the burial, he devoted himself to “religion,” and took to reading the
Enter Input : _Lives of the Saints_, for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and
Enter Input : always putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read
Enter Input : aloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had
Enter Input : somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of “the God-fearing
Enter Input : Father Isaac the Syrian,” which he read persistently for years together,
Enter Input : understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the
Enter Input : more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect
Enter Input : of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood. He was evidently shaken by
Enter Input : them, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His habit of
Enter Input : theological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformed
Enter Input : child, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompanied
Enter Input : by another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said later, had left
Enter Input : a “stamp” upon his soul. It happened that, on the very night after the
Enter Input : burial of his child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of a new-born baby.
Enter Input : She was frightened and waked her husband. He listened and said he thought
Enter Input : it was more like some one groaning, “it might be a woman.” He got up and
Enter Input : dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
Enter Input : distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard
Enter Input : into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of
Enter Input : entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going
Enter Input : back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and
Enter Input : taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still
Enter Input : persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby
Enter Input : crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he
Enter Input : heard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near the
Enter Input : garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of
Enter Input : the bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who
Enter Input : wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname
Enter Input : of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the
Enter Input : bath-house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
Enter Input : baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak.
Enter Input : But her story needs a chapter to itself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. Lizaveta
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and
Enter Input : confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a
Enter Input : dwarfish creature, “not five foot within a wee bit,” as many of the pious
Enter Input : old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad,
Enter Input : healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her
Enter Input : eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered
Enter Input : about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen
Enter Input : smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb’s wool, and formed a
Enter Input : sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had
Enter Input : leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on
Enter Input : the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
Enter Input : called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with
Enter Input : some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and
Enter Input : diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to
Enter Input : him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look
Enter Input : after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilya’s
Enter Input : employers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople,
Enter Input : tried to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots and
Enter Input : sheepskin coat for the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress her
Enter Input : up without resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral
Enter Input : porch, and taking off all that had been given her—kerchief, sheepskin,
Enter Input : skirt or boots—she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock
Enter Input : as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the
Enter Input : province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was
Enter Input : wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told she was
Enter Input : an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about
Enter Input : in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur
Enter Input : again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At
Enter Input : last her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
Enter Input : the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemed
Enter Input : to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town,
Enter Input : especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk into
Enter Input : strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her and
Enter Input : gave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and at
Enter Input : once drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a
Enter Input : roll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met.
Enter Input : Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it
Enter Input : to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted
Enter Input : anything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
Enter Input : where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on
Enter Input : her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by
Enter Input : them, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to
Enter Input : church. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle
Enter Input : (there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a
Enter Input : kitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up “at home,” that
Enter Input : is at the house of her father’s former employers, and in the winter went
Enter Input : there every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People
Enter Input : were amazed that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to
Enter Input : it, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some
Enter Input : of the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
Enter Input : that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from time to
Enter Input : time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago)
Enter Input : five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late
Enter Input : hour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through the
Enter Input : “back-way,” which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdles
Enter Input : on either side. This way leads out on to the bridge over the long,
Enter Input : stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles
Enter Input : and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They
Enter Input : stopped to look at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled
Enter Input : licentiousness. It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical
Enter Input : inquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
Enter Input : woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it
Enter Input : was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward
Enter Input : and declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, there
Enter Input : was a certain piquancy about it, and so on.... It is true that at that
Enter Input : time he was overdoing his part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself
Enter Input : forward and entertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course,
Enter Input : though in reality he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at
Enter Input : the time when he had received the news of his first wife’s death in
Enter Input : Petersburg, and, with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so
Enter Input : shamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight
Enter Input : of him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and
Enter Input : one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelled
Enter Input : the idea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity,
Enter Input : and at last they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that
Enter Input : he had gone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for certain,
Enter Input : and no one ever knew. But five or six months later, all the town was
Enter Input : talking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta’s condition,
Enter Input : and trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then
Enter Input : suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
Enter Input : other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of that drunken
Enter Input : band five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderly
Enter Input : and much respected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, who
Enter Input : could hardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundation
Enter Input : for it. But rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in
Enter Input : pointing at him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would
Enter Input : not have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
Enter Input : was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the
Enter Input : officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provoked
Enter Input : quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing some
Enter Input : people round to his side. “It’s the wench’s own fault,” he asserted, and
Enter Input : the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and
Enter Input : whose name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. This
Enter Input : conjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been in
Enter Input : the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three
Enter Input : people. But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular
Enter Input : sympathy from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
Enter Input : well-to-do merchant’s widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into her
Enter Input : house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after the
Enter Input : confinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite of their
Enter Input : vigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made her way into Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s garden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over the
Enter Input : high, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have
Enter Input : been lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
Enter Input : most likely explanation is that it happened naturally—that Lizaveta,
Enter Input : accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
Enter Input : managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt
Enter Input : down, injuring herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an
Enter Input : old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at
Enter Input : dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit
Enter Input : down, put it on her lap. “A child of God—an orphan is akin to all,” he
Enter Input : said, “and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who
Enter Input : has come from the devil’s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no
Enter Input : more.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people
Enter Input : were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted
Enter Input : vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at
Enter Input : his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname
Enter Input : for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother’s nickname.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch’s second servant, and was
Enter Input : living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.
Enter Input : He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but
Enter Input : I am ashamed of keeping my readers’ attention so long occupied with these
Enter Input : common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of
Enter Input : Smerdyakov in the course of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—In Verse
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his
Enter Input : father shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness he
Enter Input : did not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchen
Enter Input : to find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off,
Enter Input : trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting
Enter Input : him. I hasten to add that his father’s shouts, commanding him to return
Enter Input : home “with his mattress and pillow” did not frighten him in the least. He
Enter Input : understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely “a flourish”
Enter Input : to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who was
Enter Input : celebrating his name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at being
Enter Input : refused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his
Enter Input : own and his wife’s clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for the
Enter Input : sake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the
Enter Input : broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go
Enter Input : back to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he
Enter Input : was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not
Enter Input : hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
Enter Input : want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him.
Enter Input : This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he
Enter Input : went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and
Enter Input : worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear of
Enter Input : a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in the
Enter Input : note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about something.
Enter Input : This request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy
Enter Input : feeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful all
Enter Input : the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father
Enter Input : Superior’s. He was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak
Enter Input : of and what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
Enter Input : woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life, from early
Enter Input : childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was
Enter Input : afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from
Enter Input : the first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, and
Enter Input : had only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as a
Enter Input : beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which troubled
Enter Input : him, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased
Enter Input : the apprehension itself. The girl’s aims were of the noblest, he knew
Enter Input : that. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
Enter Input : though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
Enter Input : recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a
Enter Input : shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend,
Enter Input : with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was even
Enter Input : more certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. And
Enter Input : so his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to run
Enter Input : and see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing
Enter Input : him the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way
Enter Input : off, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a
Enter Input : minute, he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and
Enter Input : accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
Enter Input : direction of his terrible lady.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across the
Enter Input : market-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it is
Enter Input : scattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father was
Enter Input : expecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might be
Enter Input : unreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So he
Enter Input : decided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the
Enter Input : ground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing
Enter Input : other people’s back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
Enter Input : him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had to pass the garden adjoining his father’s, and belonging to a
Enter Input : little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, as
Enter Input : Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who had
Enter Input : been a genteel maid-servant in generals’ families in Petersburg. Now she
Enter Input : had been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She always dressed
Enter Input : up in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had sunk into such
Enter Input : poverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s kitchen for soup
Enter Input : and bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up
Enter Input : for soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even had
Enter Input : a long train—a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always
Enter Input : knew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it as soon
Enter Input : as he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he remembered the dress
Enter Input : with the train, raised his head, which had been bowed in thought, and came
Enter Input : upon something quite unexpected.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaning
Enter Input : forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously afraid to
Enter Input : utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,” Mitya
Enter Input : said in a joyful, hurried whisper. “Climb in here quickly! How splendid
Enter Input : that you’ve come! I was just thinking of you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over the hurdle.
Enter Input : Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump. Tucking up
Enter Input : his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a
Enter Input : bare-legged street urchin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well done! Now come along,” said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where?” whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in a
Enter Input : deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small, but
Enter Input : the house was at least fifty paces away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no one here. Why do you whisper?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!” cried Dmitri at the top of his voice.
Enter Input : “You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and on
Enter Input : the watch. I’ll explain later on, but, knowing it’s a secret, I began
Enter Input : whispering like a fool, when there’s no need. Let us go. Over there. Till
Enter Input : then be quiet. I want to kiss you.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Glory to God in the world,
Enter Input :     Glory to God in me ...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only
Enter Input : along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees, maples, limes
Enter Input : and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, from
Enter Input : which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer. The garden
Enter Input : was let out for a few roubles for the summer. There were also plantations
Enter Input : of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a
Enter Input : kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden. There,
Enter Input : in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder,
Enter Input : snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house,
Enter Input : blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still a
Enter Input : roof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built.
Enter Input : There was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a
Enter Input : retired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It
Enter Input : was all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the
Enter Input : woodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table
Enter Input : fixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which it
Enter Input : was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his brother’s
Enter Input : exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of
Enter Input : brandy and a wineglass on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s brandy,” Mitya laughed. “I see your look: ‘He’s drinking again!’
Enter Input : Distrust the apparition.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,
Enter Input :     And lay aside thy doubts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I’m not drinking, I’m only ‘indulging,’ as that pig, your Rakitin, says.
Enter Input : He’ll be a civil councilor one day, but he’ll always talk about
Enter Input : ‘indulging.’ Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you
Enter Input : to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world—in reality—in
Enter Input : re-al-i-ty—(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one but you and one ‘jade’ I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. But
Enter Input : being in love doesn’t mean loving. You may be in love with a woman and yet
Enter Input : hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit down here by
Enter Input : the table and I’ll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. You
Enter Input : shall keep quiet and I’ll go on talking, for the time has come. But on
Enter Input : reflection, you know, I’d better speak quietly, for here—here—you can
Enter Input : never tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they
Enter Input : say, ‘the story will be continued.’ Why have I been longing for you? Why
Enter Input : have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It’s five
Enter Input : days since I’ve cast anchor here.) Because it’s only to you I can tell
Enter Input : everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shall
Enter Input : fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning. Have
Enter Input : you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a
Enter Input : pit? That’s just how I’m falling, but not in a dream. And I’m not afraid,
Enter Input : and don’t you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It’s not
Enter Input : enjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong
Enter Input : spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spirit—whatever it is! Let us praise
Enter Input : nature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all
Enter Input : green, it’s still summer; four o’clock in the afternoon and the stillness!
Enter Input : Where were you going?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was going to father’s, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna’s first.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you?
Enter Input : Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my
Enter Input : ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to
Enter Input : have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent
Enter Input : any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to
Enter Input : see father and her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you really mean to send me?” cried Alyosha with a distressed
Enter Input : expression.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet,
Enter Input : be quiet for a time. Don’t be sorry, and don’t cry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that’s why you’re
Enter Input : going to her? You wouldn’t be going except for that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here is her note.” Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked
Enter Input : through it quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by
Enter Input : the back-way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old
Enter Input : fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to
Enter Input : tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I’ve
Enter Input : told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on
Enter Input : earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that’s what I need, that
Enter Input : some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from
Enter Input : everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
Enter Input : and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says,
Enter Input : ‘Do this for me’—some favor never asked before that could only be asked on
Enter Input : one’s deathbed—would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Make haste! H’m!... Don’t be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worry
Enter Input : yourself. There’s no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a new
Enter Input : turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can’t understand ecstasy. But what
Enter Input : am I saying to him? As though you didn’t understand it. What an ass I am!
Enter Input : What am I saying? ‘Be noble, O man!’—who says that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his work
Enter Input : lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his elbow on the
Enter Input : table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha,” said Mitya, “you’re the only one who won’t laugh. I should like
Enter Input : to begin—my confession—with Schiller’s _Hymn to Joy_, _An die Freude_! I
Enter Input : don’t know German, I only know it’s called that. Don’t think I’m talking
Enter Input : nonsense because I’m drunk. I’m not a bit drunk. Brandy’s all very well,
Enter Input : but I need two bottles to make me drunk:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Silenus with his rosy phiz
Enter Input :     Upon his stumbling ass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But I’ve not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I’m not Silenus. I’m not
Enter Input : Silenus, though I am strong,(1) for I’ve made a decision once for all.
Enter Input : Forgive me the pun; you’ll have to forgive me a lot more than puns to-day.
Enter Input : Don’t be uneasy. I’m not spinning it out. I’m talking sense, and I’ll come
Enter Input : to the point in a minute. I won’t keep you in suspense. Stay, how does it
Enter Input : go?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “Wild and fearful in his cavern
Enter Input :      Hid the naked troglodyte,
Enter Input :      And the homeless nomad wandered
Enter Input :      Laying waste the fertile plain.
Enter Input :      Menacing with spear and arrow
Enter Input :      In the woods the hunter strayed....
Enter Input :      Woe to all poor wretches stranded
Enter Input :      On those cruel and hostile shores!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “From the peak of high Olympus
Enter Input :      Came the mother Ceres down,
Enter Input :      Seeking in those savage regions
Enter Input :      Her lost daughter Proserpine.
Enter Input :      But the Goddess found no refuge,
Enter Input :      Found no kindly welcome there,
Enter Input :      And no temple bearing witness
Enter Input :      To the worship of the gods.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “From the fields and from the vineyards
Enter Input :      Came no fruits to deck the feasts,
Enter Input :      Only flesh of bloodstained victims
Enter Input :      Smoldered on the altar-fires,
Enter Input :      And where’er the grieving goddess
Enter Input :      Turns her melancholy gaze,
Enter Input :      Sunk in vilest degradation
Enter Input :      Man his loathsomeness displays.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha’s hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. There’s a
Enter Input : terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble.
Enter Input : Don’t think I’m only a brute in an officer’s uniform, wallowing in dirt
Enter Input : and drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man—if only I’m
Enter Input : not lying. I pray God I’m not lying and showing off. I think about that
Enter Input : man because I am that man myself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Would he purge his soul from vileness
Enter Input :     And attain to light and worth,
Enter Input :     He must turn and cling for ever
Enter Input :     To his ancient Mother Earth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I don’t
Enter Input : kiss her. I don’t cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or a
Enter Input : shepherd? I go on and I don’t know whether I’m going to shame or to light
Enter Input : and joy. That’s the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle! And
Enter Input : whenever I’ve happened to sink into the vilest degradation (and it’s
Enter Input : always been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres and man. Has it
Enter Input : reformed me? Never! For I’m a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit,
Enter Input : I go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that
Enter Input : degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths of
Enter Input : that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me be
Enter Input : vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is
Enter Input : shrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I
Enter Input : love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Joy everlasting fostereth
Enter Input :     The soul of all creation,
Enter Input :     It is her secret ferment fires
Enter Input :     The cup of life with flame.
Enter Input :     ’Tis at her beck the grass hath turned
Enter Input :     Each blade towards the light
Enter Input :     And solar systems have evolved
Enter Input :     From chaos and dark night,
Enter Input :     Filling the realms of boundless space
Enter Input :     Beyond the sage’s sight.
Enter Input :     At bounteous Nature’s kindly breast,
Enter Input :     All things that breathe drink Joy,
Enter Input :     And birds and beasts and creeping things
Enter Input :     All follow where She leads.
Enter Input :     Her gifts to man are friends in need,
Enter Input :     The wreath, the foaming must,
Enter Input :     To angels—vision of God’s throne,
Enter Input :     To insects—sensual lust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness that
Enter Input : every one would laugh at. But you won’t laugh. Your eyes are shining, too.
Enter Input : Enough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gave
Enter Input : “sensual lust.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     To insects—sensual lust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we
Enter Input : Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives in
Enter Input : you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests, because
Enter Input : sensual lust is a tempest—worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and
Enter Input : awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can
Enter Input : be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet
Enter Input : and all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man,
Enter Input : brother, but I’ve thought a lot about this. It’s terrible what mysteries
Enter Input : there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as
Enter Input : we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can’t endure
Enter Input : the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of
Enter Input : the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What’s still more awful is
Enter Input : that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal
Enter Input : of the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on
Enter Input : fire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too
Enter Input : broad, indeed. I’d have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of
Enter Input : it! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart.
Enter Input : Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind
Enter Input : beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing is
Enter Input : that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are
Enter Input : fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a man always
Enter Input : talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.”

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—In Anecdote
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent several
Enter Input : thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That’s a swinish invention, and
Enter Input : there was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didn’t need money
Enter Input : simply for _that_. With me money is an accessory, the overflow of my
Enter Input : heart, the framework. To-day she would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out
Enter Input : of the streets in her place. I entertained them both. I threw away money
Enter Input : by the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the
Enter Input : ladies, too, for they’ll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be
Enter Input : pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of
Enter Input : them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths, little
Enter Input : dark back-alleys behind the main road—there one finds adventures and
Enter Input : surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking figuratively,
Enter Input : brother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in the
Enter Input : literal sense, but morally there were. If you were like me, you’d know
Enter Input : what that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I loved
Enter Input : cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov!
Enter Input : Once we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was
Enter Input : dark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girl’s hand, and forced her
Enter Input : to kiss me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle,
Enter Input : submissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She
Enter Input : thought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer (I
Enter Input : was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn’t say a word to her for
Enter Input : five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we were always
Enter Input : having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fire—a
Enter Input : fire of gentle indignation. This game only tickled that insect lust I
Enter Input : cherished in my soul. Five months later she married an official and left
Enter Input : the town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live
Enter Input : happily. Observe that I told no one. I didn’t boast of it. Though I’m full
Enter Input : of low desires, and love what’s low, I’m not dishonorable. You’re
Enter Input : blushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this
Enter Input : was nothing much—wayside blossoms _à la_ Paul de Kock—though the cruel
Enter Input : insect had already grown strong in my soul. I’ve a perfect album of
Enter Input : reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to break it
Enter Input : off without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of one
Enter Input : of them. But that’s enough. You can’t suppose I brought you here simply to
Enter Input : talk of such nonsense. No, I’m going to tell you something more curious;
Enter Input : and don’t be surprised that I’m glad to tell you, instead of being
Enter Input : ashamed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You say that because I blushed,” Alyosha said suddenly. “I wasn’t
Enter Input : blushing at what you were saying or at what you’ve done. I blushed because
Enter Input : I am the same as you are.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You? Come, that’s going a little too far!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it’s not too far,” said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not a
Enter Input : new one). “The ladder’s the same. I’m at the bottom step, and you’re
Enter Input : above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That’s how I see it. But it’s all
Enter Input : the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound
Enter Input : to go up to the top one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then one ought not to step on at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Any one who can help it had better not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But can you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so.
Enter Input : That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that she’d
Enter Input : devour you one day. There, there, I won’t! From this field of corruption
Enter Input : fouled by flies, let’s pass to my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that is
Enter Input : by every sort of vileness. Although the old man told lies about my
Enter Input : seducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy,
Enter Input : though it was only once, and then it did not come off. The old man who has
Enter Input : reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I
Enter Input : never told any one about it. You’re the first, except Ivan, of course—Ivan
Enter Input : knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan’s a tomb.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan’s a tomb?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha listened with great attention.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
Enter Input : like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little
Enter Input : town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so
Enter Input : myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although they
Enter Input : shook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man,
Enter Input : took a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had
Enter Input : powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he
Enter Input : couldn’t do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him
Enter Input : with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
Enter Input : really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives,
Enter Input : both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as
Enter Input : unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when I
Enter Input : was there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her mother’s
Enter Input : sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but
Enter Input : lively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of
Enter Input : more charming character than Agafya—fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna!
Enter Input : And she wasn’t bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with
Enter Input : a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had
Enter Input : not married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but was
Enter Input : as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in ‘that’ way, it was
Enter Input : pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I
Enter Input : used to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Many
Enter Input : women like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it very
Enter Input : amusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady. She
Enter Input : and her aunt lived in her father’s house with a sort of voluntary
Enter Input : humility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She was
Enter Input : a general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever
Enter Input : dressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without
Enter Input : asking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn’t refuse.
Enter Input : The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one of the
Enter Input : chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained the
Enter Input : whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I arrived and joined the
Enter Input : battalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of the
Enter Input : colonel’s second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionable
Enter Input : school in the capital. This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she
Enter Input : was the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguished
Enter Input : general’s family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she too brought
Enter Input : the colonel no money. She had connections, and that was all. There may
Enter Input : have been expectations, but they had come to nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the whole
Enter Input : town revived. Our most distinguished ladies—two ‘Excellencies’ and a
Enter Input : colonel’s wife—and all the rest following their lead, at once took her up
Enter Input : and gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of the balls and
Enter Input : picnics, and they got up _tableaux vivants_ in aid of distressed
Enter Input : governesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of
Enter Input : my exploits at the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking my
Enter Input : measure one evening at the battery commander’s, but I didn’t go up to her,
Enter Input : as though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an
Enter Input : evening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed
Enter Input : her lips scornfully. ‘Wait a bit. I’ll have my revenge,’ thought I. I
Enter Input : behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I was
Enter Input : conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt that ‘Katenka’
Enter Input : was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proud
Enter Input : and really high-principled; above all, she had education and intellect,
Enter Input : and I had neither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply
Enter Input : wanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didn’t seem to
Enter Input : feel it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
Enter Input : put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father sent me six
Enter Input : thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claims
Enter Input : upon him—settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldn’t
Enter Input : expect anything more. I didn’t understand a word of it at the time. Until
Enter Input : I came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I
Enter Input : haven’t been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father.
Enter Input : But never mind that, we’ll talk of it later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me
Enter Input : something that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, were
Enter Input : dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected of
Enter Input : irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him.
Enter Input : And then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil of
Enter Input : a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I won’t tell you
Enter Input : how it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked
Enter Input : coolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends all
Enter Input : turned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya
Enter Input : Ivanovna, with whom I’d always kept up a friendship, and said, ‘Do you
Enter Input : know there’s a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
Enter Input : father’s accounts?’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not long
Enter Input : ago, and everything was all right.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Then it was, but now it isn’t.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She was terribly scared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Don’t frighten me!’ she said. ‘Who told you so?’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Don’t be uneasy,’ I said, ‘I won’t tell any one. You know I’m as silent
Enter Input : as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of “possibilities,” to add, that when
Enter Input : they demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he can’t produce it,
Enter Input : he’ll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age,
Enter Input : unless you like to send me your young lady secretly. I’ve just had money
Enter Input : paid me. I’ll give her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret
Enter Input : religiously.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Ah, you scoundrel!’—that’s what she said. ‘You wicked scoundrel! How
Enter Input : dare you!’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once more
Enter Input : that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures, Agafya
Enter Input : and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels all
Enter Input : through this business. They genuinely adored their ‘Katya,’ thought her
Enter Input : far above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her of
Enter Input : our conversation. I found that out afterwards. She didn’t keep it back,
Enter Input : and of course that was all I wanted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The old
Enter Input : lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn’t leave his room for two
Enter Input : days, and didn’t hand over the government money. Dr. Kravchenko declared
Enter Input : that he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long
Enter Input : time, that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands
Enter Input : except when the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend
Enter Input : it to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
Enter Input : widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to go to the
Enter Input : fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum to
Enter Input : the colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interest
Enter Input : on the loan. But this time (I heard all about it quite by chance from
Enter Input : Trifonov’s son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in
Enter Input : the world)—this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair.
Enter Input : The lieutenant-colonel flew to him. ‘I’ve never received any money from
Enter Input : you, and couldn’t possibly have received any.’ That was all the answer he
Enter Input : got. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
Enter Input : round his head, while they’re all three busy putting ice on it. All at
Enter Input : once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to ‘hand
Enter Input : over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.’ He signed the
Enter Input : book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying he
Enter Input : would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barreled
Enter Input : gun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the gun
Enter Input : against his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his foot. But
Enter Input : Agafya, remembering what I had told her, had her suspicions. She stole up
Enter Input : and peeped into the room just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon
Enter Input : him from behind, threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the
Enter Input : ceiling, but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
Enter Input : him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was
Enter Input : getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed
Enter Input : my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the
Enter Input : door opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in the
Enter Input : street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two decrepit
Enter Input : old ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old things, ready
Enter Input : to do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as two
Enter Input : cast-iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at once. She walked in
Enter Input : and looked straight at me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on
Enter Input : her lips and round her mouth I saw uncertainty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘My sister told me,’ she began, ‘that you would give me 4,500 roubles if
Enter Input : I came to you for it—myself. I have come ... give me the money!’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She couldn’t keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice failed
Enter Input : her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered.
Enter Input : Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,” said Alyosha in agitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shan’t
Enter Input : spare myself. My first idea was a—Karamazov one. Once I was bitten by a
Enter Input : centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, I
Enter Input : felt a centipede biting at my heart then—a noxious insect, you understand?
Enter Input : I looked her up and down. You’ve seen her? She’s a beauty. But she was
Enter Input : beautiful in another way then. At that moment she was beautiful because
Enter Input : she was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her
Enter Input : generosity and sacrifice for her father, and I—a bug! And, scoundrel as I
Enter Input : was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. I
Enter Input : tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed my
Enter Input : heart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if there could be
Enter Input : no resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomous
Enter Input : spider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I
Enter Input : should have gone next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end
Enter Input : honorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though
Enter Input : I’m a man of base desires, I’m honest. And at that very second some voice
Enter Input : seemed to whisper in my ear, ‘But when you come to-morrow to make your
Enter Input : proposal, that girl won’t even see you; she’ll order her coachman to kick
Enter Input : you out of the yard. “Publish it through all the town,” she would say,
Enter Input : “I’m not afraid of you.” ’ I looked at the young lady, my voice had not
Enter Input : deceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from
Enter Input : her face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite was
Enter Input : roused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad’s trick: to look at
Enter Input : her with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her
Enter Input : with a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You’ve been counting
Enter Input : your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my
Enter Input : heart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity.
Enter Input : You’ve put yourself out to no purpose.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should have lost the game, of course. She’d have run away. But it would
Enter Input : have been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all. I’d have
Enter Input : howled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played that
Enter Input : trick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any other
Enter Input : woman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with hatred. But, on my
Enter Input : oath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful
Enter Input : hatred—that hate which is only a hair’s-breadth from love, from the
Enter Input : maddest love!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I
Enter Input : remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long,
Enter Input : don’t be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the drawer
Enter Input : and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying in a
Enter Input : French dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it, handed it
Enter Input : to her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her a
Enter Input : deep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! She
Enter Input : shuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale—white
Enter Input : as a sheet, in fact—and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently,
Enter Input : bowed down to my feet—not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow,
Enter Input : with her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
Enter Input : my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I
Enter Input : don’t know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it
Enter Input : was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from
Enter Input : delight? But I didn’t stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back
Enter Input : in the scabbard—which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And
Enter Input : I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on
Enter Input : rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who
Enter Input : pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that ‘adventure’ with Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you—no one else.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his
Enter Input : handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the same
Enter Input : place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn
Enter Input : quite round to face him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—"Heels Up"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now,” said Alyosha, “I understand the first half.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was played
Enter Input : out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I understand nothing of that second half so far,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I? Do you suppose I understand it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop, Dmitri. There’s one important question. Tell me, you were
Enter Input : betrothed, you are betrothed still?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We weren’t betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure.
Enter Input : The next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, that
Enter Input : there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer. On
Enter Input : her side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained in
Enter Input : the town; except, indeed, for one action. The day after her visit the
Enter Input : maid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it
Enter Input : open: it contained the change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five
Enter Input : hundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred
Enter Input : on changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I don’t
Enter Input : remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searched
Enter Input : the packet for a pencil mark—n-nothing! Well, I spent the rest of the
Enter Input : money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to the
Enter Input : astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the money
Enter Input : untouched. He’d no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed, and,
Enter Input : three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five days
Enter Input : afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had time to
Enter Input : receive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with
Enter Input : her aunt and sister, went to Moscow. And, behold, on the very day they
Enter Input : went away (I hadn’t seen them, didn’t see them off or take leave) I
Enter Input : received a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line
Enter Input : in pencil: ‘I will write to you. Wait. K.’ And that was all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changed
Enter Input : with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabian
Enter Input : fairy-tale. That general’s widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lost
Enter Input : the two nieces who were her heiresses and next-of-kin—both died in the
Enter Input : same week of small-pox. The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed
Enter Input : Katya as a daughter, as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in
Enter Input : Katya’s favor. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for
Enter Input : present use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what
Enter Input : she liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
Enter Input : Moscow, later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles. I
Enter Input : was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later came
Enter Input : the promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She offers
Enter Input : to be my wife, offers herself to me. ‘I love you madly,’ she says, ‘even
Enter Input : if you don’t love me, never mind. Be my husband. Don’t be afraid. I won’t
Enter Input : hamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under
Enter Input : your feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.’
Enter Input : Alyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
Enter Input : my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myself
Enter Input : of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don’t mind—that I don’t
Enter Input : mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it was impossible for me to
Enter Input : go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears. One thing I shall be ashamed of
Enter Input : for ever. I referred to her being rich and having a dowry while I was only
Enter Input : a stuck-up beggar! I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence,
Enter Input : but it slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all
Enter Input : I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do you
Enter Input : look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with
Enter Input : her; he’s in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, in
Enter Input : the world’s opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving
Enter Input : of us all now. Oo! Don’t you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she
Enter Input : respects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like
Enter Input : me, especially after all that has happened here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man like
Enter Input : him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She loves her own _virtue_, not me.” The words broke involuntarily, and
Enter Input : almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his eyes
Enter Input : gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I swear, Alyosha,” he cried, with intense and genuine anger at himself;
Enter Input : “you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is God, I swear
Enter Input : that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I know that I am a
Enter Input : million times baser in soul than she, and that these lofty sentiments of
Enter Input : hers are as sincere as a heavenly angel’s. That’s the tragedy of it—that I
Enter Input : know that for certain. What if any one does show off a bit? Don’t I do it
Enter Input : myself? And yet I’m sincere, I’m sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand
Enter Input : how he must be cursing nature now—with his intellect, too! To see the
Enter Input : preference given—to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he is
Enter Input : betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can’t restrain his
Enter Input : debaucheries—and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man like me
Enter Input : is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl wants to
Enter Input : sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It’s ridiculous! I’ve
Enter Input : never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped a
Enter Input : hint of the sort to me. But destiny will be accomplished, and the best man
Enter Input : will hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his
Enter Input : back-alley for ever—his filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where
Enter Input : he is at home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free
Enter Input : will and with enjoyment. I’ve been talking foolishly. I’ve no words left.
Enter Input : I use them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
Enter Input : back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop, Dmitri,” Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. “There’s one
Enter Input : thing you haven’t made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same,
Enter Input : aren’t you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your betrothed,
Enter Input : doesn’t want to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in
Enter Input : Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The general’s
Enter Input : wife blessed us, and—would you believe it?—congratulated Katya. ‘You’ve
Enter Input : made a good choice,’ she said, ‘I see right through him.’ And—would you
Enter Input : believe it?—she didn’t like Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of
Enter Input : talk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about myself—sincerely, honorably.
Enter Input : She listened to everything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     There was sweet confusion,
Enter Input :     There were tender words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty promise
Enter Input : to reform. I gave my promise, and here—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very
Enter Input : day—remember it—to send you—this very day again—to Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : and—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, ‘He sends you
Enter Input : his compliments.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But is that possible?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just the reason I’m sending you, in my place, because it’s
Enter Input : impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And where are you going?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To the back-alley.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Grushenka, then!” Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.
Enter Input : “Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had just
Enter Input : visited her, and that was all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and with
Enter Input : such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, I
Enter Input : have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be
Enter Input : betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look at
Enter Input : me? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and I
Enter Input : know for a fact now, that that captain, father’s agent, had given
Enter Input : Grushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an
Enter Input : end to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a
Enter Input : glimpse of her before. She doesn’t strike one at first sight. I knew about
Enter Input : her old merchant, who’s lying ill now, paralyzed; but he’s leaving her a
Enter Input : decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that she
Enter Input : hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that she’s a
Enter Input : merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I stayed. The storm
Enter Input : broke—it struck me down like the plague. I’m plague-stricken still, and I
Enter Input : know that everything is over, that there will never be anything more for
Enter Input : me. The cycle of the ages is accomplished. That’s my position. And though
Enter Input : I’m a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my
Enter Input : pocket. I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from
Enter Input : here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there
Enter Input : drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. In
Enter Input : three days’ time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the hero
Enter Input : had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue,
Enter Input : Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in her
Enter Input : little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that was
Enter Input : all, I swear! ‘I’ll marry you if you like,’ she said, ‘you’re a beggar,
Enter Input : you know. Say that you won’t beat me, and will let me do anything I
Enter Input : choose, and perhaps I will marry you.’ She laughed, and she’s laughing
Enter Input : still!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though he
Enter Input : were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you really mean to marry her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At once, if she will. And if she won’t, I shall stay all the same. I’ll
Enter Input : be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!” he cried. He stopped short before
Enter Input : him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently. “Do you
Enter Input : know, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium, senseless delirium, for
Enter Input : there’s a tragedy here. Let me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man,
Enter Input : with low and degraded passions, but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri
Enter Input : Karamazov never can be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and
Enter Input : a pickpocket. That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka,
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don’t know, I
Enter Input : suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of the
Enter Input : province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow,
Enter Input : so that nothing should be known of it in the town here. So I had that
Enter Input : three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it
Enter Input : was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been to
Enter Input : the town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sent
Enter Input : the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven’t brought it.
Enter Input : I’ve forgotten it. Now what do you think you’re going to her to-day to
Enter Input : say? ‘He sends his compliments,’ and she’ll ask you, ‘What about the
Enter Input : money?’ You might still have said to her, ‘He’s a degraded sensualist, and
Enter Input : a low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn’t send your money
Enter Input : then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn’t control
Enter Input : himself.’ But still you might have added, ‘He isn’t a thief though. Here
Enter Input : is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya
Enter Input : Ivanovna. But he told me to say “he sends his compliments.” ’ But, as it
Enter Input : is, she will ask, ‘But where is the money?’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don’t worry
Enter Input : yourself to death with despair.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, do you suppose I’d shoot myself because I can’t get three thousand
Enter Input : to pay back? That’s just it. I shan’t shoot myself. I haven’t the strength
Enter Input : now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I’m going to Grushenka. I don’t care
Enter Input : what happens.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I’ll
Enter Input : go into the next room. I’ll clean her friends’ goloshes, blow up their
Enter Input : samovar, run their errands.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,” Alyosha said solemnly. “She’ll
Enter Input : understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty
Enter Input : mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. She’ll see that for
Enter Input : herself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She won’t forgive everything,” said Dmitri, with a grin. “There’s
Enter Input : something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what
Enter Input : would be the best thing to do?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Pay back the three thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give you
Enter Input : another thousand—that makes three. Take it and pay it back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And when would you get it, your three thousand? You’re not of age,
Enter Input : besides, and you must—you absolutely must—take my farewell to her to-day,
Enter Input : with the money or without it, for I can’t drag on any longer, things have
Enter Input : come to such a pass. To-morrow is too late. I shall send you to father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, Mitya, he won’t give it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As though he would! I know he won’t. Do you know the meaning of despair,
Enter Input : Alexey?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I’ve had it all from him, I know
Enter Input : that. But morally he owes me something, doesn’t he? You know he started
Enter Input : with twenty-eight thousand of my mother’s money and made a hundred
Enter Input : thousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eight
Enter Input : thousand, and he’ll draw my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many
Enter Input : of his sins. For that three thousand—I give you my solemn word—I’ll make
Enter Input : an end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the last
Enter Input : time I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God Himself sends him
Enter Input : this chance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, he won’t give it for anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know he won’t. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. That’s not
Enter Input : all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps only
Enter Input : yesterday he found out for the first time _in earnest_ (underline _in
Enter Input : earnest_) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means to
Enter Input : marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose he’s
Enter Input : going to give me money to help to bring that about when he’s crazy about
Enter Input : her himself? And that’s not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I
Enter Input : know that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of
Enter Input : the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large
Enter Input : envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see
Enter Input : how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: ‘To my angel,
Enter Input : Grushenka, when she will come to me.’ He scrawled it himself in silence
Enter Input : and in secret, and no one knows that the money’s there except the valet,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now he has been expecting
Enter Input : Grushenka for the last three or four days; he hopes she’ll come for the
Enter Input : money. He has sent her word of it, and she has sent him word that perhaps
Enter Input : she’ll come. And if she does go to the old man, can I marry her after
Enter Input : that? You understand now why I’m here in secret and what I’m on the watch
Enter Input : for.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Foma
Enter Input : comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He does jobs for
Enter Input : them. He’s watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time; and
Enter Input : that’s how he lives. I’ve established myself in his room. Neither he nor
Enter Input : the women of the house know the secret—that is, that I am on the watch
Enter Input : here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was he told you about the money, then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. It’s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn’t know about the money, or
Enter Input : anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three
Enter Input : days’ journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he’ll give eight
Enter Input : thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him by
Enter Input : going to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That’s what the
Enter Input : old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he’s away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then he’s expecting Grushenka to-day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, she won’t come to-day; there are signs. She’s certain not to come,”
Enter Input : cried Mitya suddenly. “Smerdyakov thinks so, too. Father’s drinking now.
Enter Input : He’s sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three
Enter Input : thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, dear, what’s the matter with you?” cried Alyosha, jumping up from
Enter Input : his place, and looking keenly at his brother’s frenzied face. For one
Enter Input : moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it? I’m not insane,” said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestly
Enter Input : at him. “No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what I’m saying.
Enter Input : I believe in miracles.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In miracles?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my
Enter Input : despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won’t let something awful
Enter Input : happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. I know it will take some time. You can’t go at him point blank. He’s
Enter Input : drunk now. I’ll wait three hours—four, five, six, seven. Only remember you
Enter Input : must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if it has to be at midnight, _with
Enter Input : the money or without the money_, and say, ‘He sends his compliments to
Enter Input : you.’ I want you to say that verse to her: ‘He sends his compliments to
Enter Input : you.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day—if not to-day, to-morrow, or
Enter Input : the next day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And if—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If there’s an if, it will be murder. I couldn’t endure it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who will be murdered?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The old man. I shan’t kill her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, what are you saying?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I don’t know.... I don’t know. Perhaps I shan’t kill, and perhaps I
Enter Input : shall. I’m afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his
Enter Input : face at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his eyes, his
Enter Input : shameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. That’s what I’m afraid of.
Enter Input : That’s what may be too much for me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best, that
Enter Input : nothing awful may happen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn’t come to pass—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his father’s house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. Smerdyakov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a
Enter Input : dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room,
Enter Input : which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation.
Enter Input : The furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky
Enter Input : material. In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in
Enter Input : elaborate white and gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. On the walls,
Enter Input : covered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two
Enter Input : large portraits—one of some prince who had been governor of the district
Enter Input : thirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead.
Enter Input : In the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a
Enter Input : lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as
Enter Input : to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three
Enter Input : or four o’clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night
Enter Input : or sit in an arm-chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He
Enter Input : often slept quite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge;
Enter Input : but usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been
Enter Input : served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.
Enter Input : Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory and
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemed
Enter Input : in singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter.
Enter Input : Before he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so
Enter Input : well, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached
Enter Input : the good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here he is! Here he is!” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at
Enter Input : seeing Alyosha. “Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it’s hot
Enter Input : and good. I don’t offer you brandy, you’re keeping the fast. But would you
Enter Input : like some? No; I’d better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : go to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look
Enter Input : sharp!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind. If you won’t have it, we will,” said Fyodor Pavlovitch,
Enter Input : beaming. “But stay—have you dined?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and
Enter Input : drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior’s kitchen. “Though I should
Enter Input : be pleased to have some hot coffee.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo, my darling! He’ll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No, it’s
Enter Input : boiling. It’s capital coffee: Smerdyakov’s making. My Smerdyakov’s an
Enter Input : artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You must come
Enter Input : one day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay;
Enter Input : didn’t I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow
Enter Input : and all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I haven’t,” said Alyosha, smiling, too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren’t
Enter Input : you? There, my darling, I couldn’t do anything to vex you. Do you know,
Enter Input : Ivan, I can’t resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs?
Enter Input : It makes me laugh all over. I’m so fond of him. Alyosha, let me give you
Enter Input : my blessing—a father’s blessing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no,” he said. “I’ll just make the sign of the cross over you, for
Enter Input : now. Sit still. Now we’ve a treat for you, in your own line, too. It’ll
Enter Input : make you laugh. Balaam’s ass has begun talking to us here—and how he
Enter Input : talks! How he talks!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Balaam’s ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young man
Enter Input : of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not that he
Enter Input : was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to
Enter Input : despise everybody.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up by
Enter Input : Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up “with no sense of gratitude,” as
Enter Input : Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the
Enter Input : world mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats,
Enter Input : and burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as
Enter Input : though it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead
Enter Input : cat as though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the
Enter Input : greatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a
Enter Input : sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week. “He
Enter Input : doesn’t care for you or me, the monster,” Grigory used to say to Marfa,
Enter Input : “and he doesn’t care for any one. Are you a human being?” he said,
Enter Input : addressing the boy directly. “You’re not a human being. You grew from the
Enter Input : mildew in the bath-house.(2) That’s what you are.” Smerdyakov, it appeared
Enter Input : afterwards, could never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to
Enter Input : read and write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the
Enter Input : Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third
Enter Input : lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s that for?” asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from under
Enter Input : his spectacles.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, and
Enter Input : stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.
Enter Input : There was something positively condescending in his expression. Grigory
Enter Input : could not restrain himself. “I’ll show you where!” he cried, and gave the
Enter Input : boy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, but
Enter Input : withdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he had his
Enter Input : first attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of his
Enter Input : life—epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy
Enter Input : seemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he
Enter Input : never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him.
Enter Input : Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy something
Enter Input : sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed an
Enter Input : active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the
Enter Input : disease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, once
Enter Input : a month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some
Enter Input : were light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade
Enter Input : Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to
Enter Input : come upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a
Enter Input : time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the
Enter Input : glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books—over a hundred—but no
Enter Input : one ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the
Enter Input : bookcase. “Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You’ll be better sitting
Enter Input : reading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,” and Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He read a little but didn’t like it. He did not once smile, and ended by
Enter Input : frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why? Isn’t it funny?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov did not speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Answer, stupid!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all untrue,” mumbled the boy, with a grin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, here’s
Enter Input : Smaragdov’s _Universal History_. That’s all true. Read that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought it
Enter Input : dull. So the bookcase was closed again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary
Enter Input : fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his spoon and look
Enter Input : into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it to
Enter Input : the light.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it? A beetle?” Grigory would ask.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A fly, perhaps,” observed Marfa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread,
Enter Input : his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to the
Enter Input : light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberation
Enter Input : decide to put it in his mouth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach! What fine gentlemen’s airs!” Grigory muttered, looking at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he
Enter Input : determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained. He
Enter Input : spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance. He
Enter Input : looked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had grown wrinkled,
Enter Input : yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he seemed almost exactly
Enter Input : the same as before he went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not
Enter Input : the slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we
Enter Input : heard afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little
Enter Input : interest for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice
Enter Input : of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and
Enter Input : displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow well
Enter Input : dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes most
Enter Input : scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning his
Enter Input : smart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone like
Enter Input : mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a
Enter Input : salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade,
Enter Input : perfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the
Enter Input : female sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them.
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were
Enter Input : becoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did
Enter Input : not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are your fits getting worse?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking
Enter Input : askance at his new cook. “Would you like to get married? Shall I find you
Enter Input : a wife?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that he
Enter Input : had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three
Enter Input : hundred-rouble notes which he had only just received. He only missed them
Enter Input : next day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the
Enter Input : notes lying on the table. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked
Enter Input : them up and brought them in the day before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, my lad, I’ve never met any one like you,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said
Enter Input : shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed in
Enter Input : his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although the
Enter Input : young man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent.
Enter Input : He rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what
Enter Input : the young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have
Enter Input : been impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop
Enter Input : suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand
Enter Input : still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his face
Enter Input : would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only a
Enter Input : sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by the painter
Enter Input : Kramskoy, called “Contemplation.” There is a forest in winter, and on a
Enter Input : roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a
Enter Input : torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he
Enter Input : is not thinking; he is “contemplating.” If any one touched him he would
Enter Input : start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. It’s true he
Enter Input : would come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been
Enter Input : thinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden
Enter Input : within himself, the impression which had dominated him during the period
Enter Input : of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards
Enter Input : them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he
Enter Input : does not know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many
Enter Input : years, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his
Enter Input : soul’s salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native
Enter Input : village, and perhaps do both. There are a good many “contemplatives” among
Enter Input : the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he probably
Enter Input : was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing why.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. The Controversy
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Balaam’s ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one.
Enter Input : Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from the
Enter Input : shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared in
Enter Input : the newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken prisoner in some
Enter Input : remote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death
Enter Input : if he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny
Enter Input : his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and
Enter Input : glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk,
Enter Input : if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humored
Enter Input : and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening to the story, he
Enter Input : observed that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and to
Enter Input : take his skin to some monastery. “That would make the people flock, and
Enter Input : bring the money in.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched,
Enter Input : but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who was
Enter Input : standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table towards the
Enter Input : end of dinner, and since Ivan’s arrival in our town he had done so every
Enter Input : day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you grinning at?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile
Enter Input : instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, my opinion is,” Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a
Enter Input : loud voice, “that if that laudable soldier’s exploit was so very great
Enter Input : there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such an
Enter Input : emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his own
Enter Input : christening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which, in
Enter Input : the course of years to expiate his cowardice.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could it not be a sin? You’re talking nonsense. For that you’ll go
Enter Input : straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,” put in Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we
Enter Input : have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’re on your subject, your subject,” he chuckled gleefully, making
Enter Input : Alyosha sit down to listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As for mutton, that’s not so, and there’ll be nothing there for this, and
Enter Input : there shouldn’t be either, if it’s according to justice,” Smerdyakov
Enter Input : maintained stoutly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean ‘according to justice’?” Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still
Enter Input : more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s a rascal, that’s what he is!” burst from Grigory. He looked
Enter Input : Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” answered
Enter Input : Smerdyakov with perfect composure. “You’d better consider yourself that,
Enter Input : once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they
Enter Input : demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy
Enter Input : christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there
Enter Input : would be no sin in it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you’ve said that before. Don’t waste words. Prove it,” cried Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Soup-maker!” muttered Grigory contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself,
Enter Input : Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those
Enter Input : enemies, ‘No, I’m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,’ then at once,
Enter Input : by God’s high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema
Enter Input : accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a
Enter Input : heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but
Enter Input : when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am
Enter Input : cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really
Enter Input : answering Fyodor Pavlovitch’s questions, and was well aware of it, and
Enter Input : intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, “stoop down for me to whisper.
Enter Input : He’s got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise him. Praise
Enter Input : him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father’s excited whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more.
Enter Input : “Ivan, your ear again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I love you as I do Alyosha. Don’t think I don’t love you. Some brandy?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.—But you’re rather drunk yourself,” thought Ivan, looking steadily at
Enter Input : his father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re anathema accursed, as it is,” Grigory suddenly burst out, “and how
Enter Input : dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t scold him, Grigory, don’t scold him,” Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him
Enter Input : short.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen,
Enter Input : for I haven’t finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I become
Enter Input : accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen,
Enter Input : and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isn’t that
Enter Input : so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Make haste and finish, my boy,” Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping from
Enter Input : his wine-glass with relish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And if I’ve ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy
Enter Input : when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I had
Enter Input : already been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of the
Enter Input : thought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy. And if I
Enter Input : have already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justice
Enter Input : can I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for having
Enter Input : denied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him I
Enter Input : had been relieved from my christening? If I’m no longer a Christian, then
Enter Input : I can’t renounce Christ, for I’ve nothing then to renounce. Who will hold
Enter Input : an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for
Enter Input : not having been born a Christian? And who would punish him for that,
Enter Input : considering that you can’t take two skins off one ox? For God Almighty
Enter Input : Himself, even if He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies would
Enter Input : give him the smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must be
Enter Input : punished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the world
Enter Input : an unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God can’t surely take a
Enter Input : Tatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty would
Enter Input : tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even
Enter Input : in one word?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearly
Enter Input : starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what was
Enter Input : said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a
Enter Input : man who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied
Enter Input : his glass and went off into his shrill laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must have
Enter Input : been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who
Enter Input : taught you? But you’re talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense,
Enter Input : nonsense. Don’t cry, Grigory, we’ll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a
Enter Input : moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you
Enter Input : have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say
Enter Input : yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once
Enter Input : you’re anathema they won’t pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you
Enter Input : say to that, my fine Jesuit?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was
Enter Input : no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How’s that the most ordinary?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You lie, accursed one!” hissed Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” Smerdyakov went on, staid and
Enter Input : unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to the
Enter Input : vanquished foe. “Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in
Enter Input : the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a
Enter Input : mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your
Enter Input : bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I’m without faith and you have so
Enter Input : great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself
Enter Input : telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that’s a long way off,
Enter Input : but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the
Enter Input : garden. You’ll see for yourself that it won’t budge, but will remain just
Enter Input : where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory
Enter Input : Vassilyevitch, that you haven’t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse
Enter Input : others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day,
Enter Input : not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest
Enter Input : peasant, can shove mountains into the sea—except perhaps some one man in
Enter Input : the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls
Enter Input : in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn’t find them—if
Enter Input : so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that
Enter Input : is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the
Enter Input : desert, and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And
Enter Input : so I’m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven
Enter Input : if I shed tears of repentance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. “So you do
Enter Input : suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it,
Enter Input : write it down. There you have the Russian all over!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re quite right in saying it’s characteristic of the people’s faith,”
Enter Input : Ivan assented, with an approving smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It’s true, isn’t it,
Enter Input : Alyosha? That’s the Russian faith all over, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,” said Alyosha firmly and
Enter Input : gravely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only
Enter Input : that idea. Surely that’s Russian, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that’s purely Russian,” said Alyosha smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I’ll give it to you to-day.
Enter Input : But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you,
Enter Input : stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness,
Enter Input : because we haven’t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second
Enter Input : place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours in
Enter Input : the day, so that one hasn’t even time to get sleep enough, much less to
Enter Input : repent of one’s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies
Enter Input : when you’d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I
Enter Input : consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
Enter Input : that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then
Enter Input : in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been
Enter Input : sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the
Enter Input : pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn’t have come to torture
Enter Input : then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the
Enter Input : mountain, ‘Move and crush the tormentor,’ and it would have moved and at
Enter Input : the very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have
Enter Input : walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.
Enter Input : But, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that
Enter Input : mountain, ‘Crush these tormentors,’ and it hadn’t crushed them, how could
Enter Input : I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of
Enter Input : mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not
Enter Input : attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain
Enter Input : had not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up
Enter Input : aloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to
Enter Input : come). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no
Enter Input : good purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back,
Enter Input : even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry. And
Enter Input : at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose
Enter Input : one’s reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all.
Enter Input : And, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my
Enter Input : advantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin. And
Enter Input : so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that
Enter Input : I might be altogether forgiven.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. Over The Brandy
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had
Enter Input : been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy, and it
Enter Input : was already a glass too much.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Get along with you, Jesuits!” he cried to the servants. “Go away,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov. I’ll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but be
Enter Input : off! Don’t cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She’ll comfort you and put you to
Enter Input : bed. The rascals won’t let us sit in peace after dinner,” he snapped
Enter Input : peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It’s you he’s so
Enter Input : interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?” he added to Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing whatever,” answered Ivan. “He’s pleased to have a high opinion of
Enter Input : me; he’s a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution, however,
Enter Input : when the time comes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For revolution?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him as
Enter Input : well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And when will the time come?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not very
Enter Input : fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, brother, but a Balaam’s ass like that thinks and thinks, and the
Enter Input : devil knows where he gets to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s storing up ideas,” said Ivan, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, I know he can’t bear me, nor any one else, even you, though you
Enter Input : fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha, he
Enter Input : despises Alyosha. But he doesn’t steal, that’s one thing, and he’s not a
Enter Input : gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn’t wash our dirty linen in public.
Enter Input : He makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth talking
Enter Input : about so much?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course he isn’t.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant, generally
Enter Input : speaking, needs thrashing. That I’ve always maintained. Our peasants are
Enter Input : swindlers, and don’t deserve to be pitied, and it’s a good thing they’re
Enter Input : still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed the
Enter Input : forests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people.
Enter Input : We’ve left off thrashing the peasants, we’ve grown so clever, but they go
Enter Input : on thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. ‘For with what measure ye
Enter Input : mete it shall be measured to you again,’ or how does it go? Anyhow, it
Enter Input : will be measured. But Russia’s all swinishness. My dear, if you only knew
Enter Input : how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice! But maybe I
Enter Input : mean Russia. _Tout cela c’est de la cochonnerie_.... Do you know what I
Enter Input : like? I like wit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve had another glass. That’s enough.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait a bit. I’ll have one more, and then another, and then I’ll stop. No,
Enter Input : stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and he
Enter Input : told me: ‘There’s nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to be
Enter Input : thrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And the
Enter Input : girl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in marriage to-morrow.
Enter Input : So it quite suits the girls, too,’ he said. There’s a set of de Sades for
Enter Input : you! But it’s clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh?
Enter Input : Alyosha, are you blushing? Don’t be bashful, child. I’m sorry I didn’t
Enter Input : stay to dinner at the Superior’s and tell the monks about the girls at
Enter Input : Mokroe. Alyosha, don’t be angry that I offended your Superior this
Enter Input : morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, of
Enter Input : course, I’m to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if there
Enter Input : isn’t a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It’s not enough to
Enter Input : cut their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it,
Enter Input : Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you don’t believe it as I see
Enter Input : from your eyes. You believe what people say, that I’m nothing but a
Enter Input : buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that I’m nothing but a buffoon?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t believe it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I believe you don’t, and that you speak the truth. You look sincere
Enter Input : and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan’s supercilious.... I’d make an
Enter Input : end of your monks, though, all the same. I’d take all that mystic stuff
Enter Input : and suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all the
Enter Input : fools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into the
Enter Input : mint!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why suppress it?” asked Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That Truth may prevail. That’s why.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you’d be the first to be robbed
Enter Input : and suppressed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! I dare say you’re right. Ah, I’m an ass!” burst out Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. “Well, your
Enter Input : monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that’s how it is. And we clever
Enter Input : people will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have
Enter Input : been so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God or
Enter Input : not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s belief in the existence of two saints who could move
Enter Input : mountains.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, am I like him now, then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very much.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that shows I’m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.
Enter Input : And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall
Enter Input : I catch you? What do you bet that I’ll catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the
Enter Input : same, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious
Enter Input : now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, there is no God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, is there a God?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny
Enter Input : bit?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is no immortality either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “None at all?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “None at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?
Enter Input : Anything is better than nothing!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Absolute nothingness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, is there immortality?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God and immortality?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God and immortality. In God is immortality.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “H’m! It’s more likely Ivan’s right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what
Enter Input : force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for
Enter Input : how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last
Enter Input : time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And for the last time there is not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be the devil,” said Ivan, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the devil? Does he exist?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, there’s no devil either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn’t I do to the man who first
Enter Input : invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There would have been no civilization if they hadn’t invented God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wouldn’t there have been? Without God?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take your
Enter Input : brandy away from you, anyway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I’ve hurt Alyosha’s
Enter Input : feelings. You’re not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than your
Enter Input : head.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you. Ivan,
Enter Input : do you love Alyosha?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You must love him” (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk).
Enter Input : “Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was
Enter Input : excited. But there’s wit in that elder, don’t you think, Ivan?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very likely.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is, there is. _Il y a du Piron là-dedans._ He’s a Jesuit, a Russian
Enter Input : one, that is. As he’s an honorable person there’s a hidden indignation
Enter Input : boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, of course, he believes in God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not a bit of it. Didn’t you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.
Enter Input : That is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He said
Enter Input : straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: ‘_Credo_, but I don’t know
Enter Input : in what.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Really?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He really did. But I respect him. There’s something of Mephistopheles
Enter Input : about him, or rather of ‘The hero of our time’ ... Arbenin, or what’s his
Enter Input : name?... You see, he’s a sensualist. He’s such a sensualist that I should
Enter Input : be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. You
Enter Input : know, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last he invited
Enter Input : us to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began
Enter Input : telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially
Enter Input : how he once cured a paralyzed woman. ‘If my legs were not bad I know a
Enter Input : dance I could dance you,’ he said. What do you say to that? ‘I’ve plenty
Enter Input : of tricks in my time,’ said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant, out of
Enter Input : sixty thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, he stole it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, ‘Take care of
Enter Input : it for me, friend, there’ll be a police search at my place to-morrow.’ And
Enter Input : he kept it. ‘You have given it to the Church,’ he declared. I said to him:
Enter Input : ‘You’re a scoundrel,’ I said. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I’m not a scoundrel, but I’m
Enter Input : broad-minded.’ But that wasn’t he, that was some one else. I’ve muddled
Enter Input : him with some one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and
Enter Input : that’s enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I’ve been telling lies. Why
Enter Input : didn’t you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I knew you’d stop of yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You
Enter Input : despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I’m going away. You’ve had too much brandy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve begged you for Christ’s sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two,
Enter Input : and you don’t go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll go to-morrow if you’re so set upon it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t go. You want to keep an eye on me. That’s what you want,
Enter Input : spiteful fellow. That’s why you won’t go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when the
Enter Input : drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to
Enter Input : assert himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at
Enter Input : me and say, ‘You ugly drunkard!’ Your eyes are mistrustful. They’re
Enter Input : contemptuous.... You’ve come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looks
Enter Input : at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn’t despise me. Alexey, you mustn’t
Enter Input : love Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,” Alyosha
Enter Input : said emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It’s the
Enter Input : third time I’ve told you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don’t love me, but
Enter Input : don’t be angry all the same. You’ve nothing to love me for. You go to
Enter Input : Tchermashnya. I’ll come to you myself and bring you a present. I’ll show
Enter Input : you a little wench there. I’ve had my eye on her a long time. She’s still
Enter Input : running about bare-foot. Don’t be afraid of bare-footed wenches—don’t
Enter Input : despise them—they’re pearls!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he kissed his hand with a smack.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To my thinking,” he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant he
Enter Input : touched on his favorite topic. “To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You
Enter Input : children, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a woman
Enter Input : ugly in my life—that’s been my rule! Can you understand that? How could
Enter Input : you understand it? You’ve milk in your veins, not blood. You’re not out of
Enter Input : your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something
Enter Input : devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn’t find in any other.
Enter Input : Only, one must know how to find it, that’s the point! That’s a talent! To
Enter Input : my mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she is a woman is half
Enter Input : the battle ... but how could you understand that? Even in _vieilles
Enter Input : filles_, even in them you may discover something that makes you simply
Enter Input : wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without
Enter Input : noticing them. Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by
Enter Input : surprise. Didn’t you know that? You must astound them till they’re
Enter Input : fascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with
Enter Input : such a little slut. It’s a jolly good thing that there always are and will
Enter Input : be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little
Enter Input : maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that’s all that’s needed
Enter Input : for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your
Enter Input : mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her at all, but all
Enter Input : at once, when the minute came, I’d be all devotion to her, crawl on my
Enter Input : knees, kiss her feet, and I always, always—I remember it as though it were
Enter Input : to-day—reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh.
Enter Input : It was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that.
Enter Input : The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh
Enter Input : was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That’s
Enter Input : the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky—he was a
Enter Input : handsome fellow, and rich—used to like to come here and hang about
Enter Input : her—suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence. And she—such a
Enter Input : mild sheep—why, I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow.
Enter Input : How she set on me! ‘You’re beaten, beaten now,’ she said. ‘You’ve taken a
Enter Input : blow from him. You have been trying to sell me to him,’ she said.... ‘And
Enter Input : how dared he strike you in my presence! Don’t dare come near me again,
Enter Input : never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!’... I took her to the
Enter Input : monastery then to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her
Enter Input : back to reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor
Enter Input : crazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fond
Enter Input : of praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used
Enter Input : to turn me out of her room then. I’ll knock that mysticism out of her,
Enter Input : thought I! ‘Here,’ said I, ‘you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I
Enter Input : take it down. You believe it’s miraculous, but here, I’ll spit on it
Enter Input : directly and nothing will happen to me for it!’... When she saw it, good
Enter Input : Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her
Enter Input : hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and
Enter Input : fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what’s the
Enter Input : matter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about
Enter Input : his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha’s face. He flushed
Enter Input : crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone
Enter Input : spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very
Enter Input : strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy
Enter Input : woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat
Enter Input : exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face
Enter Input : in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical
Enter Input : paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance
Enter Input : to his mother particularly impressed the old man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It’s like her, exactly as she used to be
Enter Input : then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that’s what I
Enter Input : used to do to her. He’s upset about his mother, his mother,” he muttered
Enter Input : to Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?” said
Enter Input : Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his
Enter Input : flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a
Enter Input : second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man’s mind that Alyosha’s
Enter Input : mother actually was the mother of Ivan too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your mother?” he muttered, not understanding. “What do you mean? What
Enter Input : mother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was
Enter Input : yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me,
Enter Input : why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!” He stopped. A broad, drunken,
Enter Input : half-senseless grin overspread his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there
Enter Input : were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the
Enter Input : room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’ll kill me! He’ll kill me! Don’t let him get at me!” he screamed,
Enter Input : clinging to the skirt of Ivan’s coat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IX. The Sensualists
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been
Enter Input : struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on
Enter Input : instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking
Enter Input : advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to
Enter Input : look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on
Enter Input : the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood
Enter Input : before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the
Enter Input : entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,
Enter Input : Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then she’s there! She’s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside
Enter Input : himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might.
Enter Input : The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the
Enter Input : door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room,
Enter Input : huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s here!” shouted Dmitri. “I saw her turn towards the house just now,
Enter Input : but I couldn’t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That shout, “She’s here!” produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold him! Hold him!” he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory
Enter Input : had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran
Enter Input : after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the
Enter Input : floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase—not an expensive
Enter Input : one—on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At him!” shouted the old man. “Help!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you run after him? He’ll murder you outright,” Ivan cried
Enter Input : wrathfully at his father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka’s here. He said he saw her
Enter Input : himself, running.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden
Enter Input : news that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling all over.
Enter Input : He seemed frantic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you’ve seen for yourself that she hasn’t come,” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But she may have come by that other entrance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of course, found
Enter Input : the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could
Enter Input : not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold him!” shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. “He’s
Enter Input : been stealing money in my bedroom.” And tearing himself from Ivan he
Enter Input : rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly
Enter Input : clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his
Enter Input : temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He
Enter Input : kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man
Enter Input : moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round
Enter Input : him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his
Enter Input : slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madman! You’ve killed him!” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Serve him right!” shouted Dmitri breathlessly. “If I haven’t killed him,
Enter Input : I’ll come again and kill him. You can’t protect him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri! Go away at once!” cried Alyosha commandingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey! You tell me. It’s only you I can believe; was she here just now,
Enter Input : or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. I
Enter Input : shouted, she ran away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I swear she’s not been here, and no one expected her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I saw her.... So she must ... I’ll find out at once where she is....
Enter Input : Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to Æsop about the money now. But go to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, ‘He sends his compliments to
Enter Input : you!’ Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and farewell!
Enter Input : Describe the scene to her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an
Enter Input : arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious and
Enter Input : listened greedily to Dmitri’s cries. He was still fancying that Grushenka
Enter Input : really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he
Enter Input : went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t repent shedding your blood!” he cried. “Beware, old man, beware
Enter Input : of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown you
Enter Input : altogether.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ran out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!” the old man
Enter Input : wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, she’s not here, you old lunatic!” Ivan shouted at him angrily. “Here,
Enter Input : he’s fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and put
Enter Input : him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by the
Enter Input : brandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he shut his
Enter Input : eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Ivan and
Enter Input : Alyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of
Enter Input : the broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the
Enter Input : floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shouldn’t you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?” Alyosha
Enter Input : said to him. “We’ll look after him. My brother gave you a terrible blow—on
Enter Input : the head.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s insulted me!” Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s ‘insulted’ his father, not only you,” observed Ivan with a forced
Enter Input : smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I used to wash him in his tub. He’s insulted me,” repeated Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn it all, if I hadn’t pulled him away perhaps he’d have murdered him.
Enter Input : It wouldn’t take much to do for Æsop, would it?” whispered Ivan to
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God forbid!” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why should He forbid?” Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignant
Enter Input : grimace. “One reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right,
Enter Input : too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha shuddered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course I won’t let him be murdered as I didn’t just now. Stay here,
Enter Input : Alyosha, I’ll go for a turn in the yard. My head’s begun to ache.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went to his father’s bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the
Enter Input : screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed
Enter Input : for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at
Enter Input : once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha,” he whispered apprehensively, “where’s Ivan?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the yard. He’s got a headache. He’s on the watch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the
Enter Input : chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was
Enter Input : considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a
Enter Input : rather large crimson bruise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I’m afraid of Ivan.
Enter Input : I’m more afraid of Ivan than the other. You’re the only one I’m not afraid
Enter Input : of....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he’ll defend you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, and what of the other? He’s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me
Enter Input : the truth, was she here just now or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She won’t marry him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She won’t. She won’t. She won’t. She won’t on any account!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting
Enter Input : could have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyosha’s hand and
Enter Input : pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,” he
Enter Input : said. “Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I’ll let you go back to
Enter Input : the monastery.... I was joking this morning, don’t be angry with me. My
Enter Input : head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me
Enter Input : the truth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re still asking whether she has been here or not?” Alyosha said
Enter Input : sorrowfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, no. I believe you. I’ll tell you what it is: you go to Grushenka
Enter Input : yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for yourself,
Enter Input : which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I see her I’ll ask her,” Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, she won’t tell you,” the old man interrupted, “she’s a rogue. She’ll
Enter Input : begin kissing you and say that it’s you she wants. She’s a deceitful,
Enter Input : shameless hussy. You mustn’t go to her, you mustn’t!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, father, and it wouldn’t be suitable, it wouldn’t be right at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where was he sending you just now? He shouted ‘Go’ as he ran away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Katerina Ivanovna.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For money? To ask her for money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No. Not for money.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s no money; not a farthing. I’ll settle down for the night, and think
Enter Input : things over, and you can go. Perhaps you’ll meet her.... Only be sure to
Enter Input : come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word to say to
Enter Input : you to-morrow. Will you come?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When you come, pretend you’ve come of your own accord to ask after me.
Enter Input : Don’t tell any one I told you to. Don’t say a word to Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forget
Enter Input : it. I’ve a word to say to you to-morrow—but I must think about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how do you feel now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway.
Enter Input : He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note-book. Alyosha told
Enter Input : Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him go
Enter Input : back to sleep at the monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,” said Ivan
Enter Input : cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be at the Hohlakovs’ to-morrow,” answered Alyosha, “I may be at
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s, too, if I don’t find her now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you’re going to her now, anyway? For that ‘compliments and
Enter Input : farewell,’ ” said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what
Enter Input : went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he—well, in
Enter Input : fact—takes his leave of her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?”
Enter Input : exclaimed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One can’t tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.
Enter Input : That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and
Enter Input : not let Dmitri in the house.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other
Enter Input : men and decide which is worthy to live?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in
Enter Input : men’s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights—who has
Enter Input : not the right to wish?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not for another man’s death?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What even if for another man’s death? Why lie to oneself since all men
Enter Input : live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I
Enter Input : said just now—that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let me
Enter Input : ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Æsop’s blood,
Enter Input : murdering him, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don’t
Enter Input : think Dmitri is capable of it, either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks, if only for that,” smiled Ivan. “Be sure, I should always defend
Enter Input : him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good-by
Enter Input : till to-morrow. Don’t condemn me, and don’t look on me as a villain,” he
Enter Input : added with a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt that
Enter Input : his brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had
Enter Input : certainly done this with some definite motive.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter X. Both Together
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha left his father’s house feeling even more exhausted and dejected
Enter Input : in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and
Enter Input : unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed
Enter Input : fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting
Enter Input : experiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he
Enter Input : had never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest
Enter Input : stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his
Enter Input : father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself
Enter Input : been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet
Enter Input : only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely
Enter Input : unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there were
Enter Input : other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed
Enter Input : before. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had
Enter Input : made a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring.
Enter Input : Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these
Enter Input : women? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna’s
Enter Input : in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the
Enter Input : contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from
Enter Input : her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than
Enter Input : before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and
Enter Input : Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to
Enter Input : any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the
Enter Input : scene which had just taken place with his father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was by now seven o’clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered
Enter Input : the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One of
Enter Input : them, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half-sister Agafya
Enter Input : Ivanovna who had looked after her in her father’s house when she came from
Enter Input : boarding-school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and
Enter Input : consequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they
Enter Input : both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept
Enter Input : them with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one
Enter Input : but her benefactress, the general’s widow, who had been kept by illness in
Enter Input : Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account
Enter Input : of all her doings.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to
Enter Input : him to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware of
Enter Input : his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least,
Enter Input : Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling
Enter Input : skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement.
Enter Input : He was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room,
Enter Input : elegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style. There were
Enter Input : many sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. There were pictures
Enter Input : on the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even
Enter Input : an aquarium in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made
Enter Input : out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just
Enter Input : been sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups
Enter Input : of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another with
Enter Input : sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. But
Enter Input : at that instant the portière was raised, and with rapid, hurrying
Enter Input : footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha
Enter Input : with a radiant smile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in
Enter Input : two lighted candles and set them on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank God! At last you have come too! I’ve been simply praying for you
Enter Input : all day! Sit down.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna’s beauty when, three weeks
Enter Input : before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna’s special
Enter Input : request, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation between
Enter Input : them at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very shy,
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha
Enter Input : had been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck
Enter Input : by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl.
Enter Input : And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He
Enter Input : thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her
Enter Input : pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the lines
Enter Input : of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might
Enter Input : well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for
Enter Input : long. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the
Enter Input : visit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his
Enter Input : impressions on seeing his betrothed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll be happy with her, but perhaps—not tranquilly happy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don’t yield
Enter Input : to fate. So you think I shan’t love her for ever.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won’t always be
Enter Input : happy with her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with
Enter Input : himself for having yielded to his brother’s entreaties and put such
Enter Input : “foolish” ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfully
Enter Input : foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of having
Enter Input : given so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the more
Enter Input : amazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as
Enter Input : she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This time
Enter Input : her face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct
Enter Input : warm-hearted sincerity. The “pride and haughtiness,” which had struck
Enter Input : Alyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy
Enter Input : and a sort of bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the
Enter Input : first glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in
Enter Input : relation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she
Enter Input : perhaps already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite
Enter Input : of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future.
Enter Input : Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. He
Enter Input : was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed at
Enter Input : her first words that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps
Enter Input : quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole
Enter Input : truth—from you and no one else.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have come,” muttered Alyosha confusedly, “I—he sent me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything—everything!” cried
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. “Wait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : I’ll tell you why I’ve been so longing to see you. You see, I know perhaps
Enter Input : far more than you do yourself, and there’s no need for you to tell me
Enter Input : anything. I’ll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own last
Enter Input : impression of him. I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely
Enter Input : even (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and
Enter Input : of his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps be
Enter Input : better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does not want
Enter Input : to come to me. Do you understand what I want from you? Now, tell me
Enter Input : simply, tell me every word of the message he sent you with (I knew he
Enter Input : would send you).”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He told me to give you his compliments—and to say that he would never
Enter Input : come again—but to give you his compliments.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His compliments? Was that what he said—his own expression?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did not
Enter Input : use the right word?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or three
Enter Input : times not to forget to say so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I’ll tell
Enter Input : you what I think, and you must simply say whether it’s right or not.
Enter Input : Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without insisting on
Enter Input : your repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the end
Enter Input : of everything! But if he particularly insisted on those words, if he
Enter Input : particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he
Enter Input : was in excitement, beside himself. He had made his decision and was
Enter Input : frightened at it. He wasn’t walking away from me with a resolute step, but
Enter Input : leaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply
Enter Input : bravado.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes!” cried Alyosha warmly. “I believe that is it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And, if so, he’s not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! Did he
Enter Input : not tell you anything about money—about three thousand roubles?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He did speak about it, and it’s that more than anything that’s crushing
Enter Input : him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now,” Alyosha
Enter Input : answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that
Enter Input : there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother. “But
Enter Input : do you know about the money?” he added, and suddenly broke off.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and
Enter Input : heard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadn’t sent the money,
Enter Input : but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money.
Enter Input : My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn, and
Enter Input : who was his true friend. No, he won’t recognize that I am his truest
Enter Input : friend; he won’t know me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I’ve been
Enter Input : tormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being
Enter Input : ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel
Enter Input : ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people’s knowing, but not
Enter Input : of my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it he
Enter Input : still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why,
Enter Input : why doesn’t he know me? How dare he not know me after all that has
Enter Input : happened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed.
Enter Input : And here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn’t afraid
Enter Input : to be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don’t deserve
Enter Input : the same?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must tell you,” Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, “what happened
Enter Input : just now between him and my father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the
Enter Input : money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that had
Enter Input : again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and
Enter Input : farewell. “He went to that woman,” Alyosha added softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you suppose that I can’t put up with that woman? Does he think I
Enter Input : can’t? But he won’t marry her,” she suddenly laughed nervously. “Could
Enter Input : such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? It’s passion, not love. He
Enter Input : won’t marry her because she won’t marry him.” Again Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : laughed strangely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He may marry her,” said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He won’t marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that?
Enter Input : Do you know that?” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary
Enter Input : warmth. “She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I know
Enter Input : how bewitching she is, but I know too that she is kind, firm and noble.
Enter Input : Why do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are
Enter Input : wondering at my words, perhaps you don’t believe me? Agrafena
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, my angel!” she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the
Enter Input : next room, “come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He knows all
Enter Input : about our affairs. Show yourself to him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,” said a
Enter Input : soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The portière was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, came
Enter Input : up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed his
Enter Input : eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful woman,
Enter Input : the “beast,” as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet one would
Enter Input : have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, a
Enter Input : good-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsome
Enter Input : ordinary women! It is true she was very, very good-looking with that
Enter Input : Russian beauty so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall
Enter Input : woman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was
Enter Input : exceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were,
Enter Input : noiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her
Enter Input : voice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step,
Enter Input : but noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She sank
Enter Input : softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress,
Enter Input : and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a
Enter Input : costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and her face looked
Enter Input : exactly that age. She was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint on
Enter Input : her cheeks. The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and
Enter Input : the lower jaw was set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the
Enter Input : slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked
Enter Input : pouting. But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored
Enter Input : eyebrows and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have
Enter Input : made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the
Enter Input : street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. What
Enter Input : struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good
Enter Input : nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childish
Enter Input : delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to
Enter Input : expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. The
Enter Input : light in her eyes gladdened the soul—Alyosha felt that. There was
Enter Input : something else in her which he could not understand, or would not have
Enter Input : been able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. It
Enter Input : was that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that
Enter Input : catlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl
Enter Input : could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her
Enter Input : figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in
Enter Input : somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs of
Enter Input : Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, still
Enter Input : youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, would
Enter Input : “spread”; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would very
Enter Input : soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes; the complexion would
Enter Input : grow coarse and red perhaps—in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment,
Enter Input : the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women. Alyosha,
Enter Input : of course, did not think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he
Enter Input : wondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she
Enter Input : drawled in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
Enter Input : feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the
Enter Input : syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad
Enter Input : education and a false idea of good manners. And yet this intonation and
Enter Input : manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with
Enter Input : the childishly simple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyish
Enter Input : joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an
Enter Input : arm-chair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on her
Enter Input : smiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is the first time we’ve met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said
Enter Input : rapturously. “I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her, but
Enter Input : I’d no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I knew we should
Enter Input : settle everything together—everything. My heart told me so—I was begged
Enter Input : not to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the
Enter Input : difficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything to
Enter Input : me, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness
Enter Input : and brought us peace and joy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,” drawled Grushenka
Enter Input : in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain
Enter Input : you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though it
Enter Input : were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how she
Enter Input : laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one’s heart good to see the angel.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all
Enter Input : worthy of your kindness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not worthy! She’s not worthy of it!” Katerina Ivanovna cried again with
Enter Input : the same warmth. “You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we’re fanciful, we’re
Enter Input : self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. We’re noble,
Enter Input : we’re generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only been
Enter Input : unfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy,
Enter Input : perhaps, or fickle man. There was one man—one, an officer too, we loved
Enter Input : him, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago,
Enter Input : and he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has
Enter Input : written, he is coming here, and, do you know, we’ve loved him, none but
Enter Input : him, all this time, and we’ve loved him all our life! He will come, and
Enter Input : Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she’s been
Enter Input : wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her favor? Only that
Enter Input : bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her father, her friend, her
Enter Input : protector. He found her then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man she
Enter Input : loved. She was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant saved
Enter Input : her—saved her!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurry
Enter Input : about everything,” Grushenka drawled again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?
Enter Input : Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little
Enter Input : hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and has
Enter Input : lifted me up, and I’m going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here,
Enter Input : here!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, hand
Enter Input : of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a charming
Enter Input : musical, nervous little laugh, watched the “sweet young lady,” and
Enter Input : obviously liked having her hand kissed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps there’s rather too much rapture,” thought Alyosha. He blushed. He
Enter Input : felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this
Enter Input : before Alexey Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you think I meant to make you blush?” said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhat
Enter Input : surprised. “Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady. Maybe
Enter Input : I’m not so good as I seem to you. I’ve a bad heart; I will have my own
Enter Input : way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But now you’ll save him. You’ve given me your word. You’ll explain it all
Enter Input : to him. You’ll break to him that you have long loved another man, who is
Enter Input : now offering you his hand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no! I didn’t give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking
Enter Input : about that. I didn’t give you my word.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then I didn’t quite understand you,” said Katerina Ivanovna slowly,
Enter Input : turning a little pale. “You promised—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, angel lady, I’ve promised nothing,” Grushenka interrupted softly
Enter Input : and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. “You see at
Enter Input : once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If I
Enter Input : want to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise just now. But
Enter Input : now again I’m thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much
Enter Input : once—liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him
Enter Input : to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I’m so changeable.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just now you said—something quite different,” Katerina Ivanovna whispered
Enter Input : faintly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, just now! But, you know. I’m such a soft-hearted, silly creature.
Enter Input : Only think what he’s gone through on my account! What if when I go home I
Enter Input : feel sorry for him? What then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I never expected—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now
Enter Input : perhaps you won’t care for a silly creature like me, now you know my
Enter Input : character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,” she said
Enter Input : tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna’s hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here, dear young lady, I’ll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine.
Enter Input : You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times
Enter Input : to be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as God
Enter Input : wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding
Enter Input : like a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises.
Enter Input : What a sweet hand—what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you
Enter Input : incredible beauty!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed of
Enter Input : “being even” with her in kisses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid hope
Enter Input : to the last words, though Grushenka’s promise to do her bidding like a
Enter Input : slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her eyes; she
Enter Input : still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, the
Enter Input : same bright gayety.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s perhaps too naïve,” thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of
Enter Input : hope.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the “sweet hand.” She raised
Enter Input : it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes near
Enter Input : her lips, as though reconsidering something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, angel lady,” she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and
Enter Input : sugary voice, “do you know, after all, I think I won’t kiss your hand?”
Enter Input : And she laughed a little merry laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As you please. What’s the matter with you?” said Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : starting suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn’t
Enter Input : kiss yours.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness at
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Insolent creature!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping
Enter Input : something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn’t kiss yours at
Enter Input : all. And how he will laugh!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Vile slut! Go away!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That’s unbecoming for you, dear
Enter Input : young lady, a word like that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go away! You’re a creature for sale!” screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every
Enter Input : feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once;
Enter Input : you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha held
Enter Input : her with all his strength.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not a step, not a word! Don’t speak, don’t answer her. She’ll go
Enter Input : away—she’ll go at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that instant Katerina Ivanovna’s two aunts ran in at her cry, and with
Enter Input : them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will go away,” said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa.
Enter Input : “Alyosha, darling, see me home!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go away—go away, make haste!” cried Alyosha, clasping his hands
Enter Input : imploringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I’ve got a pretty little story to tell
Enter Input : you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See me
Enter Input : home, dear, you’ll be glad of it afterwards.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house,
Enter Input : laughing musically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shaken
Enter Input : with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I warned you,” said the elder of her aunts. “I tried to prevent your
Enter Input : doing this. You’re too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You don’t
Enter Input : know these creatures, and they say she’s worse than any of them. You are
Enter Input : too self-willed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s a tigress!” yelled Katerina Ivanovna. “Why did you hold me, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch? I’d have beaten her—beaten her!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care to,
Enter Input : indeed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha withdrew towards the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, my God!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. “He! He! He
Enter Input : could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature what
Enter Input : happened on that fatal, accursed day! ‘You brought your beauty for sale,
Enter Input : dear young lady.’ She knows it! Your brother’s a scoundrel, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn’t find a word. His heart
Enter Input : ached.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It’s shameful, it’s awful for me!
Enter Input : To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don’t condemn me.
Enter Input : Forgive me. I don’t know what I shall do with myself now!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she did.
Enter Input : Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; it’s
Enter Input : been left with us since dinner-time.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost
Enter Input : unconsciously, into his pocket.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the
Enter Input : monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.
Enter Input : It was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces
Enter Input : ahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under a
Enter Input : solitary willow at the cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the
Enter Input : cross-roads the figure moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your money or your life!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So it’s you, Mitya,” cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled
Enter Input : however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ha ha ha! You didn’t expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By her
Enter Input : house? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At last
Enter Input : I thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here, there’s no other way
Enter Input : to the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But
Enter Input : what’s the matter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing, brother—it’s the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father’s blood
Enter Input : just now.” (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of tears for a
Enter Input : long time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.) “You almost
Enter Input : killed him—cursed him—and now—here—you’re making jokes—‘Your money or your
Enter Input : life!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, what of that? It’s not seemly—is that it? Not suitable in my
Enter Input : position?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No—I only—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what a
Enter Input : wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as God’s
Enter Input : above, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is there
Enter Input : to wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist
Enter Input : them into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdening
Enter Input : the earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then I heard you
Enter Input : coming—Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So
Enter Input : there is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little
Enter Input : brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I love
Enter Input : in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment that I
Enter Input : thought, ‘I’ll fall on his neck at once.’ Then a stupid idea struck me, to
Enter Input : have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a fool, ‘Your money!’
Enter Input : Forgive my foolery—it was only nonsense, and there’s nothing unseemly in
Enter Input : my soul.... Damn it all, tell me what’s happened. What did she say? Strike
Enter Input : me, crush me, don’t spare me! Was she furious?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There—I found them
Enter Input : both there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Both? Whom?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna’s.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri was struck dumb.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Impossible!” he cried. “You’re raving! Grushenka with her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s. He was ten minutes telling his story. He can’t be
Enter Input : said to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make it
Enter Input : clear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly
Enter Input : describing, often in one word, his own sensations. Dmitri listened in
Enter Input : silence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to
Enter Input : Alyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as the
Enter Input : story went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He
Enter Input : scowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more
Enter Input : rigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible
Enter Input : rapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips
Enter Input : parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous
Enter Input : laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he could not
Enter Input : speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So she wouldn’t kiss her hand! So she didn’t kiss it; so she ran away!”
Enter Input : he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might have
Enter Input : been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. “So the other one called
Enter Input : her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be flogged on a
Enter Input : scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That’s just what I think; she ought to
Enter Input : have been long ago. It’s like this, brother, let her be punished, but I
Enter Input : must get better first. I understand the queen of impudence. That’s her all
Enter Input : over! You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She’s
Enter Input : magnificent in her own line! So she ran home? I’ll go—ah—I’ll run to her!
Enter Input : Alyosha, don’t blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But Katerina Ivanovna!” exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I see her, too! I see right through her, as I’ve never done before! It’s
Enter Input : a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is, of the
Enter Input : five! What a thing to do! That’s just like Katya, who was not afraid to
Enter Input : face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generous
Enter Input : impulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness, the defiance
Enter Input : of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? That
Enter Input : aunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. She’s the sister of the general’s
Enter Input : widow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband was
Enter Input : caught stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all,
Enter Input : and the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn’t raised them since.
Enter Input : So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn’t listen to her! She thinks
Enter Input : she can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She
Enter Input : thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it
Enter Input : herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think
Enter Input : she kissed Grushenka’s hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she
Enter Input : really was fascinated by Grushenka, that’s to say, not by Grushenka, but
Enter Input : by her own dream, her own delusion—because it was _her_ dream, _her_
Enter Input : delusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did
Enter Input : you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, you don’t seem to have noticed how you’ve insulted Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face
Enter Input : just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty!
Enter Input : Brother, what could be worse than that insult?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed,
Enter Input : his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna’s humiliation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bah!” Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. He
Enter Input : only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, and
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s cry: “Your brother is a scoundrel!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that ‘fatal day,’ as
Enter Input : Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at
Enter Input : Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I was
Enter Input : sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya’s image, and Grushenka
Enter Input : understood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she cried
Enter Input : herself.... Damn it all! But it’s bound to be so now.... Then she cried,
Enter Input : but now ‘the dagger in the heart’! That’s how women are.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked down and sank into thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!” he said suddenly, in a
Enter Input : gloomy voice. “It doesn’t matter whether I cried or not, I’m a scoundrel!
Enter Input : Tell her I accept the name, if that’s any comfort. Come, that’s enough.
Enter Input : Good-by. It’s no use talking! It’s not amusing. You go your way and I
Enter Input : mine. And I don’t want to see you again except as a last resource.
Enter Input : Good-by, Alexey!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He warmly pressed Alyosha’s hand, and still looking down, without raising
Enter Input : his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!” cried Dmitri, suddenly
Enter Input : turning back. “Look at me. Look at me well. You see here, here—there’s
Enter Input : terrible disgrace in store for me.” (As he said “here,” Dmitri struck his
Enter Input : chest with his fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor lay
Enter Input : precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging
Enter Input : round his neck.) “You know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but
Enter Input : let me tell you that I’ve never done anything before and never shall
Enter Input : again, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which I
Enter Input : bear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to
Enter Input : pass, though I’m perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it
Enter Input : through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I
Enter Input : shan’t stop it. I told you everything just now, but I didn’t tell you
Enter Input : this, because even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if
Enter Input : I do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I
Enter Input : shan’t pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witness
Enter Input : that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need to
Enter Input : explain. You’ll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and the
Enter Input : she-devil. Good-by. Don’t pray for me, I’m not worth it. And there’s no
Enter Input : need, no need at all.... I don’t need it! Away!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the
Enter Input : monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?” he wondered
Enter Input : wildly. “Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall look him up. I
Enter Input : shall make a point of it. What does he mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :                   -------------------------------------
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage.
Enter Input : The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at that hour. There
Enter Input : was a tremor in his heart as he went into Father Zossima’s cell.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here was
Enter Input : peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was darkness in
Enter Input : which one lost one’s way and went astray at once....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Païssy, who came every
Enter Input : hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm that he
Enter Input : was getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the brothers
Enter Input : could not take place that day. As a rule every evening after service the
Enter Input : monks flocked into Father Zossima’s cell, and all confessed aloud their
Enter Input : sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their
Enter Input : disputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder
Enter Input : absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed
Enter Input : them. It was against this general “confession” that the opponents of
Enter Input : “elders” protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament
Enter Input : of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different
Enter Input : thing. They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such
Enter Input : confessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led to
Enter Input : sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, and
Enter Input : went against their own will because every one went, and for fear they
Enter Input : should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some of
Enter Input : the monks agreed beforehand, saying, “I’ll confess I lost my temper with
Enter Input : you this morning, and you confirm it,” simply in order to have something
Enter Input : to say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too,
Enter Input : that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that
Enter Input : letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened
Enter Input : and read by him before those to whom they were addressed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good
Enter Input : faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact,
Enter Input : there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and
Enter Input : strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks
Enter Input : adhered to their opinion, arguing that “for those who have come within
Enter Input : these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will
Enter Input : certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who
Enter Input : find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in
Enter Input : entering the monastery—their proper place is in the world. Even in the
Enter Input : temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no good taking
Enter Input : it too much into account.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,” Father Païssy whispered to
Enter Input : Alyosha, as he blessed him. “It’s difficult to rouse him. And he must not
Enter Input : be roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to the
Enter Input : brothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to take
Enter Input : the sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He asked
Enter Input : whether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the town. ‘I
Enter Input : blessed him for that work,’ he said, ‘his place is there, not here, for
Enter Input : awhile.’ Those were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with
Enter Input : anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it that he has
Enter Input : decided that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseen
Enter Input : something in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return to the
Enter Input : world, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not for
Enter Input : frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was
Enter Input : dying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly and
Enter Input : ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, the
Enter Input : Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery next
Enter Input : day, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed with
Enter Input : love, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one
Enter Input : instant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed,
Enter Input : and whom he honored above every one in the world. He went into Father
Enter Input : Zossima’s bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder,
Enter Input : who slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing
Enter Input : and a peaceful face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received his
Enter Input : guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the hard,
Enter Input : narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing nothing
Enter Input : but a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted to him that
Enter Input : morning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his cassock, which
Enter Input : he used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell on his knees and
Enter Input : prayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to
Enter Input : lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which
Enter Input : always visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which his
Enter Input : evening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him light
Enter Input : untroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the
Enter Input : little pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna’s. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some
Enter Input : hesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by
Enter Input : Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him before
Enter Input : the elder in the morning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she wrote, “I am writing to you without any one’s
Enter Input : knowledge, even mamma’s, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot live
Enter Input : without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and this
Enter Input : no one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want so
Enter Input : much to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you it’s
Enter Input : not true and that it’s blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha,
Enter Input : I love you, I’ve loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when
Enter Input : you were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my
Enter Input : life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together
Enter Input : till our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the
Enter Input : monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. By
Enter Input : that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking and
Enter Input : dancing. There can be no doubt of that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see how I’ve thought of everything. There’s only one thing I can’t
Enter Input : imagine: what you’ll think of me when you read this. I’m always laughing
Enter Input : and being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure you before
Enter Input : I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and now
Enter Input : I’m praying, and almost crying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don’t know how I
Enter Input : shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can’t restrain
Enter Input : myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day. You’ll
Enter Input : think I’m a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won’t believe my letter.
Enter Input : And so I beg you, dear one, if you’ve any pity for me, when you come
Enter Input : to-morrow, don’t look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it
Enter Input : will be sure to make me laugh, especially as you’ll be in that long gown.
Enter Input : I feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, don’t look at
Enter Input : me at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here I’ve written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha,
Enter Input : don’t despise me, and if I’ve done something very horrid and wounded you,
Enter Input : forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is
Enter Input : in your hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our _awful_
Enter Input : meeting.—LISE.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “P.S.—Alyosha! You must, must, must come!—LISE.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought a
Enter Input : little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That laugh
Enter Input : seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as softly
Enter Input : and happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himself
Enter Input : and lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at once. “God, have mercy
Enter Input : upon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy
Enter Input : keeping, and set them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them
Enter Input : according to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!”
Enter Input : Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.

Enter Input : PART II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book IV. Lacerations
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. Father Ferapont
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up feeling
Enter Input : very weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair. His
Enter Input : mind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright and almost
Enter Input : joyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality. “Maybe I
Enter Input : shall not live through the coming day,” he said to Alyosha. Then he
Enter Input : desired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to
Enter Input : Father Païssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction
Enter Input : followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the
Enter Input : inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began coming
Enter Input : from the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kiss
Enter Input : and take leave of every one. As the cell was so small the earlier visitors
Enter Input : withdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was
Enter Input : seated again in his arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his
Enter Input : voice was weak, it was fairly steady.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been teaching you so many years, and therefore I’ve been talking
Enter Input : aloud so many years, that I’ve got into the habit of talking, and so much
Enter Input : so that it’s almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk,
Enter Input : even now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,” he jested,
Enter Input : looking with emotion at the group round him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. But
Enter Input : though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his speech
Enter Input : was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he seemed anxious
Enter Input : before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life,
Enter Input : and not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirsting
Enter Input : to share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more
Enter Input : in his life to open his whole heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Love one another, Fathers,” said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could
Enter Input : remember afterwards. “Love God’s people. Because we have come here and
Enter Input : shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are
Enter Input : outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of
Enter Input : us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on
Enter Input : earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly
Enter Input : he must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here.
Enter Input : When he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is
Enter Input : responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins,
Enter Input : national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained.
Enter Input : For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for
Enter Input : all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness
Enter Input : of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual
Enter Input : man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man.
Enter Input : For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to
Enter Input : be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite,
Enter Input : universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power
Enter Input : to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world
Enter Input : with your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess
Enter Input : your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when
Enter Input : perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with
Enter Input : God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the
Enter Input : great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and
Enter Input : slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the
Enter Input : materialists—and I mean not only the good ones—for there are many good
Enter Input : ones among them, especially in our day—hate not even the wicked ones.
Enter Input : Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none
Enter Input : to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not
Enter Input : in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....
Enter Input : Love God’s people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if you
Enter Input : slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in
Enter Input : covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock.
Enter Input : Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate....
Enter Input : Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to
Enter Input : the banner and raise it on high.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his words
Enter Input : afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take breath,
Enter Input : and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They heard him
Enter Input : with emotion, though many wondered at his words and found them obscure....
Enter Input : Afterwards all remembered those words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by the
Enter Input : general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it.
Enter Input : This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout
Enter Input : solemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately
Enter Input : after the elder’s death. Their suspense was, from one point of view,
Enter Input : almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by
Enter Input : it. Father Païssy’s face looked the gravest of all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had
Enter Input : arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. In
Enter Input : it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It
Enter Input : appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive
Enter Input : Father Zossima’s blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a
Enter Input : sergeant’s widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might
Enter Input : pray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to
Enter Input : Irkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima
Enter Input : had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for
Enter Input : the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards
Enter Input : forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, “as though reading the
Enter Input : book of the future” (this was Madame Hohlakov’s expression), words of
Enter Input : comfort: “that her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come
Enter Input : himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and
Enter Input : expect him.” And “Would you believe it?” exclaimed Madame Hohlakov
Enter Input : enthusiastically, “the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and
Enter Input : more than that.” Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave
Enter Input : her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not
Enter Input : all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya
Enter Input : informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and
Enter Input : that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped “to embrace his
Enter Input : mother.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new “miracle of
Enter Input : prediction” to the Superior and all the brotherhood. “All, all, ought to
Enter Input : know of it!” she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the
Enter Input : excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had
Enter Input : no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had
Enter Input : commissioned the monk who brought his message “to inform most respectfully
Enter Input : his reverence Father Païssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of
Enter Input : with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and
Enter Input : humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.” As the monk had given the
Enter Input : message to Father Païssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after
Enter Input : reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to
Enter Input : Father Païssy in confirmation of the story.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read the
Enter Input : news of the “miracle,” could not completely restrain some inner emotion.
Enter Input : His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall see greater things!” broke from him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall see greater things, greater things yet!” the monks around
Enter Input : repeated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Father Païssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a
Enter Input : time, not to speak of the matter “till it be more fully confirmed, seeing
Enter Input : there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this
Enter Input : might well have chanced naturally,” he added, prudently, as it were to
Enter Input : satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, a
Enter Input : fact his listeners very clearly perceived.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Within the hour the “miracle” was of course known to the whole monastery,
Enter Input : and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressed
Enter Input : by it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from
Enter Input : the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had been
Enter Input : standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father
Enter Input : Zossima earnestly, referring to the “healing” of the lady’s daughter, “How
Enter Input : can you presume to do such things?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The evening
Enter Input : before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind the
Enter Input : apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit. This
Enter Input : Father Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing
Enter Input : silence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima
Enter Input : and the whole institution of “elders,” which he regarded as a pernicious
Enter Input : and frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although from
Enter Input : his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made him
Enter Input : formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling, and many
Enter Input : of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic, although
Enter Input : they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was just his craziness
Enter Input : attracted them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in the
Enter Input : hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this too
Enter Input : because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy-five or more,
Enter Input : and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell
Enter Input : which had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, who
Enter Input : had lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings many
Enter Input : curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same
Enter Input : solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant’s hut,
Enter Input : though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary number
Enter Input : of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them—which men brought to
Enter Input : the monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed to
Enter Input : look after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was
Enter Input : true) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper,
Enter Input : who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three
Enter Input : days, and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely
Enter Input : uttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament
Enter Input : bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the Father
Enter Input : Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug was changed
Enter Input : every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homage
Enter Input : saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round.
Enter Input : If he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always
Enter Input : rude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but for
Enter Input : the most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete
Enter Input : riddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in
Enter Input : explanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange
Enter Input : belief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had
Enter Input : communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and
Enter Input : so was silent with men.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the
Enter Input : beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corner
Enter Input : where Father Ferapont’s cell stood. “Maybe he will speak as you are a
Enter Input : stranger and maybe you’ll get nothing out of him,” the beekeeper had
Enter Input : warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the utmost
Enter Input : apprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was
Enter Input : sitting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightly
Enter Input : rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monk
Enter Input : from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?” said Father Ferapont. “Get up!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monk got up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict
Enter Input : fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man. He
Enter Input : was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face.
Enter Input : There was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of athletic
Enter Input : build. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray, and still had
Enter Input : very thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His
Enter Input : eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke
Enter Input : with a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant’s long reddish coat of
Enter Input : coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round
Enter Input : his waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of
Enter Input : the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changed
Enter Input : for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty pounds under his
Enter Input : coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to
Enter Input : pieces.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,” the monk answered
Enter Input : humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyes
Enter Input : kept watch on the hermit.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have been at your Sylvester’s. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester
Enter Input : well?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monk hesitated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lent
Enter Input : there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesday
Enter Input : and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries,
Enter Input : or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white cabbage soup,
Enter Input : noodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried
Enter Input : fish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening,
Enter Input : six whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and
Enter Input : water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the
Enter Input : same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing is
Enter Input : eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o’clock,
Enter Input : and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine. On
Enter Input : Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not
Enter Input : cooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy
Enter Input : Thursday: ‘It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to
Enter Input : dishonor the whole of Lent!’ This is how we keep the fast. But what is
Enter Input : that compared with you, holy Father,” added the monk, growing more
Enter Input : confident, “for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but
Enter Input : bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven.
Enter Input : It’s truly marvelous—your great abstinence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And mushrooms?” asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mushrooms?” repeated the surprised monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away into
Enter Input : the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they can’t
Enter Input : give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil.
Enter Input : Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting. Haughty and
Enter Input : unclean is their judgment.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Och, true,” sighed the monk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And have you seen devils among them?” asked Ferapont.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Among them? Among whom?” asked the monk, timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven’t been
Enter Input : since. I saw a devil sitting on one man’s chest hiding under his cassock,
Enter Input : only his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his pocket with
Enter Input : such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean belly
Enter Input : of one, another was hanging round a man’s neck, and so he was carrying him
Enter Input : about without seeing him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You—can see spirits?” the monk inquired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out from
Enter Input : the Superior’s I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, a
Enter Input : yard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip of
Enter Input : his tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the
Enter Input : door, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to struggle, and I
Enter Input : made the sign of the cross over him three times. And he died on the spot
Enter Input : like a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be
Enter Input : stinking, but they don’t see, they don’t smell it. It’s a year since I
Enter Input : have been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,” said the monk,
Enter Input : growing bolder and bolder, “is it true, as they noise abroad even to
Enter Input : distant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with the
Enter Input : Holy Ghost?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He does fly down at times.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How does he fly down? In what form?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As a bird.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s the Holy Ghost and there’s the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can
Enter Input : appear as other birds—sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch and
Enter Input : sometimes as a blue-tit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you know him from an ordinary tit?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He speaks.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How does he speak, in what language?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Human language.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what does he tell you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me
Enter Input : unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,” the monk shook
Enter Input : his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you see this tree?” asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I do, blessed Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You think it’s an elm, but for me it has another shape.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What sort of shape?” inquired the monk, after a pause of vain
Enter Input : expectation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it is
Enter Input : Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see it
Enter Input : clearly and tremble. It’s terrible, terrible!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is there terrible if it’s Christ Himself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, He’ll snatch me up and carry me away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alive?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven’t you heard? He will take me in
Enter Input : His arms and bear me away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the
Enter Input : brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at heart
Enter Input : a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima. He was
Enter Input : strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept so
Enter Input : rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should “see marvels.” His words seemed
Enter Input : certainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words,
Enter Input : and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have
Enter Input : sacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the
Enter Input : devil’s tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the
Enter Input : figurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
Enter Input : prejudice against the institution of “elders,” which he only knew of by
Enter Input : hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had been
Enter Input : long at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of some
Enter Input : shallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, a
Enter Input : meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This was
Enter Input : why the news of the fresh “miracle” performed by Father Zossima reduced
Enter Input : him to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
Enter Input : inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro
Enter Input : from one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks
Enter Input : that were crowding within and without the elder’s cell. But he did not pay
Enter Input : much attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling
Enter Input : tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closing
Enter Input : his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was no one else in
Enter Input : the cell but Father Païssy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The
Enter Input : elder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him
Enter Input : suddenly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are your people expecting you, my son?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha hesitated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Haven’t they need of you? Didn’t you promise some one yesterday to see
Enter Input : them to-day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did promise—to my father—my brothers—others too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, you must go. Don’t grieve. Be sure I shall not die without your
Enter Input : being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, it
Enter Input : will be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love me. But
Enter Input : now go to keep your promise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise that
Enter Input : he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last gift to
Enter Input : him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He made haste
Enter Input : that he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly.
Enter Input : Father Païssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved and
Enter Input : surprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell together.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Remember, young man, unceasingly,” Father Païssy began, without preface,
Enter Input : “that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has,
Enter Input : especially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down to
Enter Input : us in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this world
Enter Input : have nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have only
Enter Input : analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is
Enter Input : marvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the
Enter Input : gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen
Enter Input : centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul
Enter Input : and in the masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the
Enter Input : souls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who have
Enter Input : renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow
Enter Input : the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of
Enter Input : their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue
Enter Input : than the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the
Enter Input : result has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young man, since
Enter Input : you are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Maybe,
Enter Input : remembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the
Enter Input : heart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the
Enter Input : world are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
Enter Input : orphan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the monastery
Enter Input : and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a new and
Enter Input : unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who had
Enter Input : hitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father Zossima had
Enter Input : bequeathed him to him at his death, and “perhaps that’s just what had
Enter Input : passed between them,” Alyosha thought suddenly. The philosophic
Enter Input : reflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of
Enter Input : Father Païssy’s heart. He was in haste to arm the boy’s mind for conflict
Enter Input : with temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the
Enter Input : strongest defense he could imagine.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. At His Father’s
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered that
Enter Input : his father had insisted the day before that he should come without his
Enter Input : brother Ivan seeing him. “Why so?” Alyosha wondered suddenly. “Even if my
Enter Input : father has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most
Enter Input : likely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different,”
Enter Input : he decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the
Enter Input : garden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
Enter Input : told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two
Enter Input : hours ago.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And my father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is up, taking his coffee,” Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing
Enter Input : slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by looking
Enter Input : through some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone in
Enter Input : the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had got up
Enter Input : early and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired and weak.
Enter Input : His forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the
Enter Input : night, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen
Enter Input : terribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches,
Enter Input : giving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old
Enter Input : man was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he came
Enter Input : in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The coffee is cold,” he cried harshly; “I won’t offer you any. I’ve
Enter Input : ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don’t invite any one
Enter Input : to share it. Why have you come?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To find out how you are,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It’s all of no consequence.
Enter Input : You need not have troubled. But I knew you’d come poking in directly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up and
Enter Input : looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the fortieth time that
Enter Input : morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red handkerchief more
Enter Input : becomingly on his forehead.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Red’s better. It’s just like the hospital in a white one,” he observed
Enter Input : sententiously. “Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is very bad; he may die to-day,” answered Alyosha. But his father had
Enter Input : not listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan’s gone out,” he said suddenly. “He is doing his utmost to carry off
Enter Input : Mitya’s betrothed. That’s what he is staying here for,” he added
Enter Input : maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Surely he did not tell you so?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks ago?
Enter Input : You don’t suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have had some
Enter Input : object in coming.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean? Why do you say such things?” said Alyosha, troubled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He doesn’t ask for money, it’s true, but yet he won’t get a farthing from
Enter Input : me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dear
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer I live,
Enter Input : the more I shall need it,” he continued, pacing from one corner of the
Enter Input : room to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy
Enter Input : overcoat made of yellow cotton material. “I can still pass for a man at
Enter Input : five and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As I
Enter Input : get older, you know, I shan’t be a pretty object. The wenches won’t come
Enter Input : to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am saving up
Enter Input : more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may
Enter Input : as well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.
Enter Input : For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do it
Enter Input : on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall upon me for
Enter Input : being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my
Enter Input : taste, let me tell you that; and it’s not the proper place for a
Enter Input : gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleep
Enter Input : and don’t wake up again, and that’s all. You can pray for my soul if you
Enter Input : like. And if you don’t want to, don’t, damn you! That’s my philosophy.
Enter Input : Ivan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a
Enter Input : conceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learning ... nor education
Enter Input : either. He sits silent and smiles at one without speaking—that’s what
Enter Input : pulls him through.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha listened to him in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why won’t he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your
Enter Input : Ivan is a scoundrel! And I’ll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to.
Enter Input : For if you’ve money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing
Enter Input : and you can have it. That’s what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to
Enter Input : prevent me getting married and that’s why he is egging on Mitya to marry
Enter Input : Grushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I
Enter Input : should leave him my money if I don’t marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
Enter Input : Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that’s what he’s
Enter Input : reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How cross you are! It’s because of yesterday; you had better lie down,”
Enter Input : said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There! you say that,” the old man observed suddenly, as though it had
Enter Input : struck him for the first time, “and I am not angry with you. But if Ivan
Enter Input : said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have good
Enter Input : moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are not ill-natured, but distorted,” said Alyosha with a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and I
Enter Input : don’t know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in these
Enter Input : fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice, but
Enter Input : even now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about by the
Enter Input : hair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of murdering him
Enter Input : outright—all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him
Enter Input : and could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you don’t mean to take proceedings?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn’t care about Ivan, but there’s another
Enter Input : thing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I send the ruffian to prison, she’ll hear of it and run to see him at
Enter Input : once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within an
Enter Input : inch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For that’s her
Enter Input : way, everything by contraries. I know her through and through! Won’t you
Enter Input : have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I’ll pour a quarter of a
Enter Input : glass of brandy into it, it’s delicious, my boy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, thank you. I’ll take that roll with me if I may,” said Alyosha, and
Enter Input : taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock.
Enter Input : “And you’d better not have brandy, either,” he suggested apprehensively,
Enter Input : looking into the old man’s face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them.
Enter Input : Only one little glass. I’ll get it out of the cupboard.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the
Enter Input : cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough. One glass won’t kill me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see you are in a better humor now,” said Alyosha, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a
Enter Input : scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya—why is that? He wants to spy
Enter Input : how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels! But I
Enter Input : don’t recognize Ivan, I don’t know him at all. Where does he come from? He
Enter Input : is not one of us in soul. As though I’d leave him anything! I shan’t leave
Enter Input : a will at all, you may as well know. And I’ll crush Mitya like a beetle. I
Enter Input : squash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread
Enter Input : on them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_ Mitya, for you love him.
Enter Input : Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan
Enter Input : loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan loves
Enter Input : nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.
Enter Input : They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will be
Enter Input : gone.... I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; I
Enter Input : wanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a
Enter Input : thousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
Enter Input : off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
Enter Input : Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I—I’ll ask him,” muttered Alyosha. “If you would give him three thousand,
Enter Input : perhaps he—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s nonsense! You needn’t ask him now, no need! I’ve changed my mind.
Enter Input : It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won’t give him anything, not a penny,
Enter Input : I want my money myself,” cried the old man, waving his hand. “I’ll crush
Enter Input : him like a beetle without it. Don’t say anything to him or else he will
Enter Input : begin hoping. There’s nothing for you to do here, you needn’t stay. Is
Enter Input : that betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully
Enter Input : hidden from me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see
Enter Input : her yesterday, I believe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing will induce her to abandon him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and a
Enter Input : scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies,
Enter Input : very different from—Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then (for I
Enter Input : was better-looking than he at eight and twenty) I’d have been a conquering
Enter Input : hero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shan’t have Grushenka, anyway,
Enter Input : he shan’t! I’ll crush him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His anger had returned with the last words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can go. There’s nothing for you to do here to-day,” he snapped
Enter Input : harshly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s that for?” The old man was a little surprised. “We shall see each
Enter Input : other again, or do you think we shan’t?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all, I didn’t mean anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nor did I, I did not mean anything,” said the old man, looking at him.
Enter Input : “Listen, listen,” he shouted after him, “make haste and come again and
Enter Input : I’ll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to-day. Be sure to
Enter Input : come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the cupboard
Enter Input : again and poured out another half-glass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t have more!” he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he locked
Enter Input : the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into his bedroom,
Enter Input : lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,” thought Alyosha, as he
Enter Input : left his father’s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov’s, “or I might
Enter Input : have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed
Enter Input : their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. “Father is
Enter Input : spiteful and angry, he’s made some plan and will stick to it. And what of
Enter Input : Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and
Enter Input : angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in
Enter Input : finding him to-day, whatever happens.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road,
Enter Input : which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on
Enter Input : him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out
Enter Input : into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High
Enter Input : Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of
Enter Input : schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were
Enter Input : going home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others
Enter Input : with leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
Enter Input : little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round the
Enter Input : ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The whole
Enter Input : group was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council.
Enter Input : Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children without
Enter Input : taking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of children
Enter Input : of three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so,
Enter Input : anxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them.
Enter Input : He looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the
Enter Input : boys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
Enter Input : there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a satchel at
Enter Input : his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and with
Enter Input : sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other
Enter Input : six, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school,
Enter Input : but with whom he had evidently had a feud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a black
Enter Input : jacket, observed:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on my
Enter Input : left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you’ve got yours on your
Enter Input : right side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
Enter Input : remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once into
Enter Input : confidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of
Enter Input : children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on a
Enter Input : perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he is left-handed,” another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven,
Enter Input : answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He even throws stones with his left hand,” observed a third.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the
Enter Input : left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy
Enter Input : standing the other side of the ditch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,” they all shouted. But Smurov, the
Enter Input : left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threw
Enter Input : a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other side
Enter Input : of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones,
Enter Input : flung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha
Enter Input : and hit him painfully on the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!”
Enter Input : the boys shouted, laughing. “Come, all throw at him at once!” and six
Enter Input : stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down,
Enter Input : but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Both
Enter Input : sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full
Enter Input : too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you about! Aren’t you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you’ll kill
Enter Input : him,” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Three
Enter Input : or four ceased throwing for a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He began first!” cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice.
Enter Input : “He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a
Enter Input : penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn’t tell tales, but he must be
Enter Input : thrashed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what for? I suppose you tease him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,” cried the
Enter Input : children. “It’s you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at
Enter Input : him again, don’t miss, Smurov!” and again a fire of stones, and a very
Enter Input : vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the
Enter Input : chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky
Enter Input : Street. They all shouted: “Aha, he is funking, he is running away. Wisp of
Enter Input : tow!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good for
Enter Input : him,” said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be the
Enter Input : eldest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s wrong with him?” asked Alyosha, “is he a tell-tale or what?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?” the same boy went on. “Catch him
Enter Input : up.... You see he’s stopped again, he is waiting and looking at you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is looking at you,” the other boys chimed in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask him
Enter Input : that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they at
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t go near him, he’ll hurt you,” cried Smurov in a warning voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shan’t ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him with
Enter Input : that question somehow. But I’ll find out from him why you hate him so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Find out then, find out,” cried the boys, laughing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight
Enter Input : towards the boy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better look out,” the boys called after him; “he won’t be afraid of
Enter Input : you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did Krassotkin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha saw
Enter Input : facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weakly
Enter Input : boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him
Enter Input : vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had
Enter Input : monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There
Enter Input : was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot
Enter Input : just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened
Enter Input : with ink. Both the pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with
Enter Input : stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at
Enter Input : him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha’s eyes that he wouldn’t beat
Enter Input : him, became less defiant, and addressed him first.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am alone, and there are six of them. I’ll beat them all, alone!” he
Enter Input : said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,” observed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I hit Smurov on the head!” cried the boy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on
Enter Input : purpose,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boy looked darkly at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know you. Do you know me?” Alyosha continued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me alone!” the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though he
Enter Input : were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his
Enter Input : eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well, I am going,” said Alyosha; “only I don’t know you and I don’t
Enter Input : tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don’t want to tease you.
Enter Input : Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Monk in silk trousers!” cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same
Enter Input : vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude
Enter Input : of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha
Enter Input : turned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone three steps before
Enter Input : the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the
Enter Input : back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you’ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say
Enter Input : that you attack on the sly,” said Alyosha, turning round again. This time
Enter Input : the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha’s face; but Alyosha just
Enter Input : had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aren’t you ashamed? What have I done to you?” he cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack
Enter Input : him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild
Enter Input : beast’s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move,
Enter Input : the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his
Enter Input : middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he
Enter Input : let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all
Enter Input : his might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance.
Enter Input : Alyosha’s finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it
Enter Input : began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly
Enter Input : round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood
Enter Input : waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well,” he said, “you see how badly you’ve bitten me. That’s enough,
Enter Input : isn’t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boy stared in amazement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Though I don’t know you and it’s the first time I’ve seen you,” Alyosha
Enter Input : went on with the same serenity, “yet I must have done something to you—you
Enter Input : wouldn’t have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How have
Enter Input : I wronged you, tell me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away.
Enter Input : Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a long
Enter Input : time he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turning
Enter Input : his head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his
Enter Input : mind to find him out as soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery.
Enter Input : Just now he had not the time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. At The Hohlakovs’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov’s house, a handsome stone house of
Enter Input : two stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame Hohlakov spent
Enter Input : most of her time in another province where she had an estate, or in
Enter Input : Moscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she had a house in our town
Enter Input : too, inherited from her forefathers. The estate in our district was the
Enter Input : largest of her three estates, yet she had been very little in our province
Enter Input : before this time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you get my letter about the new miracle?” She spoke rapidly and
Enter Input : nervously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his mother!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is dying to-day,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some one,
Enter Input : about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I can’t see him!
Enter Input : The whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense. But now—do you
Enter Input : know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, that’s lucky,” cried Alyosha. “Then I shall see her here. She told me
Enter Input : yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know, I know all. I’ve heard exactly what happened yesterday—and the
Enter Input : atrocious behavior of that—creature. _C’est tragique_, and if I’d been in
Enter Input : her place I don’t know what I should have done. And your brother Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?—my goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : I am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there with her, not that
Enter Input : dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, he is sitting with her talking; they are having a serious
Enter Input : conversation. If you could only imagine what’s passing between them
Enter Input : now—it’s awful, I tell you it’s lacerating, it’s like some incredible tale
Enter Input : of horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
Enter Input : They both recognize it and revel in it. I’ve been watching for you! I’ve
Enter Input : been thirsting for you! It’s too much for me, that’s the worst of it. I’ll
Enter Input : tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of something else,
Enter Input : the most important thing—I had quite forgotten what’s most important. Tell
Enter Input : me, why has Lise been in hysterics? As soon as she heard you were here,
Enter Input : she began to be hysterical!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Maman_, it’s you who are hysterical now, not I,” Lise’s voice caroled
Enter Input : through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice sounded as though
Enter Input : she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to control it. Alyosha at
Enter Input : once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping through it, but that
Enter Input : he could not see.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me hysterical
Enter Input : too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has been so ill all
Enter Input : night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the morning and for
Enter Input : Herzenstube to come. He says that he can make nothing of it, that we must
Enter Input : wait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it. As
Enter Input : soon as you approached the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and
Enter Input : insisted on being wheeled back into this room here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, I didn’t know he had come. It wasn’t on his account I wanted to be
Enter Input : wheeled into this room.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch was
Enter Input : coming. She was on the look-out for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My darling mamma, it’s not at all clever of you. But if you want to make
Enter Input : up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma, you’d better tell our
Enter Input : honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he has shown his want of wit by
Enter Input : venturing to us after what happened yesterday and although every one is
Enter Input : laughing at him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who laughs at
Enter Input : him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can’t do without him. Oh,
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what’s the matter with you, mamma, darling?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful night
Enter Input : of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting, everlasting,
Enter Input : that’s the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything.... Even that
Enter Input : miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how it has shattered me, that
Enter Input : miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And that tragedy in the drawing-room,
Enter Input : it’s more than I can bear, I warn you. I can’t bear it. A comedy, perhaps,
Enter Input : not a tragedy. Tell me, will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he?
Enter Input : Oh, my God! What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and see
Enter Input : that it’s all nonsense, all nonsense.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should be very grateful,” Alyosha interrupted suddenly, “if you could
Enter Input : give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have hurt it, and it’s
Enter Input : very painful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked with blood.
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha’s finger through the crack, she flung the
Enter Input : door wide open.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, come here,” she cried, imperiously. “No nonsense now! Good heavens,
Enter Input : why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time? He might
Enter Input : have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water! You must wash
Enter Input : it first of all, simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain, and keep
Enter Input : it there, keep it there.... Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin.
Enter Input : But do make haste,” she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at
Enter Input : the sight of Alyosha’s wound.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shouldn’t we send for Herzenstube?” cried Madame Hohlakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, you’ll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say that
Enter Input : he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodness’ sake go
Enter Input : yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can come
Enter Input : quickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, it’s nothing much,” cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Some lint, mamma, for mercy’s sake, bring some lint and that muddy
Enter Input : caustic lotion for wounds, what’s it called? We’ve got some. You know
Enter Input : where the bottle is, mamma; it’s in your bedroom in the right-hand
Enter Input : cupboard, there’s a big bottle of it there with the lint.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don’t scream and don’t
Enter Input : fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you get
Enter Input : such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?” she
Enter Input : asked Alyosha, quickly. “And then I’ll talk to you about something quite
Enter Input : different. Well?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother’s absence was precious
Enter Input : for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the
Enter Input : schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at his
Enter Input : story.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?” she cried
Enter Input : angrily, as though she had a right to control him. “You are nothing but a
Enter Input : boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you must find out for
Enter Input : me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there’s some
Enter Input : mystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a question: does the
Enter Input : pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things, but talking
Enter Input : sensibly?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course not, and I don’t feel much pain now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s because your finger is in the water. It must be changed directly,
Enter Input : for it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice from the cellar
Enter Input : and another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can speak; will you give me
Enter Input : the letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch—be quick, for
Enter Input : mamma will be back in a minute and I don’t want—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I haven’t got the letter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You’ve got it in
Enter Input : that pocket. I’ve been regretting that joke all night. Give me back the
Enter Input : letter at once, give it me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve left it at home.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you can’t consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly
Enter Input : joke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me the
Enter Input : letter, if you really haven’t got it—bring it to-day, you must, you must.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To-day I can’t possibly, for I am going back to the monastery and I
Enter Input : shan’t come and see you for the next two days—three or four perhaps—for
Enter Input : Father Zossima—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very much?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I didn’t laugh at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Because I believed all you said.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are insulting me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would come to
Enter Input : pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the monastery.
Enter Input : Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you reach the legal
Enter Input : age we will be married. I shall love you. Though I haven’t had time to
Enter Input : think about it, I believe I couldn’t find a better wife than you, and
Enter Input : Father Zossima tells me I must marry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,” laughed Lise, flushing
Enter Input : crimson.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll wheel you about myself, but I’m sure you’ll get well by then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you are mad,” said Lise, nervously, “to make all this nonsense out of
Enter Input : a joke! Here’s mamma, very _à propos_, perhaps. Mamma, how slow you always
Enter Input : are, how can you be so long! And here’s Yulia with the ice!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, Lise, don’t scream, above all things don’t scream. That scream drives
Enter Input : me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place? I’ve been
Enter Input : hunting and hunting—I do believe you did it on purpose.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I couldn’t tell that he would come with a bad finger, or else perhaps
Enter Input : I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you begin to say really
Enter Input : witty things.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling for
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch’s sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, what’s
Enter Input : killing me is no one thing in particular, not Herzenstube, but everything
Enter Input : together, that’s what is too much for me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,” Lise laughed gayly.
Enter Input : “Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That’s simply Goulard’s
Enter Input : water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but it’s a splendid
Enter Input : lotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had a fight with
Enter Input : the boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger, isn’t he a child,
Enter Input : a child himself? Is he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he
Enter Input : wants to be married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn’t it be
Enter Input : funny, wouldn’t it be awful?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly at
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? It’s quite
Enter Input : out of place—and perhaps the boy was rabid.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might have
Enter Input : been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near
Enter Input : him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldn’t have
Enter Input : done it. Do you still feel the pain?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s nothing much now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t feel afraid of water?” asked Lise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, that’s enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick talking
Enter Input : of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : has only just heard that you are here, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply
Enter Input : rushed at me, she’s dying to see you, dying!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can’t go just now, he is in too much
Enter Input : pain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all, I can go quite well,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What! You are going away? Is that what you say?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, when I’ve seen them, I’ll come back here and we can talk as much as
Enter Input : you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once, for I am
Enter Input : very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don’t trouble to come
Enter Input : and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your monastery and a good
Enter Input : riddance. I want to sleep, I didn’t sleep all night.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would sleep!” cried
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know what I’ve done.... I’ll stay another three minutes, five if
Enter Input : you like,” muttered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a monster.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too
Enter Input : capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one has with
Enter Input : nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you.
Enter Input : How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how fortunate it is!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it, mamma.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov
Enter Input : began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid whisper. “I don’t
Enter Input : want to suggest anything, I don’t want to lift the veil, you will see for
Enter Input : yourself what’s going on. It’s appalling. It’s the most fantastic farce.
Enter Input : She loves your brother, Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuade
Enter Input : herself she loves your brother, Dmitri. It’s appalling! I’ll go in with
Enter Input : you, and if they don’t turn me out, I’ll stay to the end.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment
Enter Input : Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take
Enter Input : leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For
Enter Input : this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some
Enter Input : time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times
Enter Input : suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : and, what was more, that he meant “to carry her off” from Dmitri. Until
Enter Input : quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him
Enter Input : extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between
Enter Input : them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was
Enter Input : glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him,
Enter Input : Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that
Enter Input : Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had
Enter Input : till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a
Enter Input : steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till
Enter Input : the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving
Enter Input : a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he
Enter Input : was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But during yesterday’s scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him.
Enter Input : The word “lacerating,” which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered, almost made
Enter Input : him start, because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had cried
Enter Input : out “Laceration, laceration,” probably applying it to his dream. He had
Enter Input : been dreaming all night of the previous day’s scene at Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna’s. Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov’s blunt and
Enter Input : persistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and
Enter Input : only deceived herself through some sort of pose, from “self-laceration,”
Enter Input : and tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied
Enter Input : duty of gratitude. “Yes,” he thought, “perhaps the whole truth lies in
Enter Input : those words.” But in that case what was Ivan’s position? Alyosha felt
Enter Input : instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna’s must dominate, and
Enter Input : she could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan.
Enter Input : For Dmitri might at last submit to her domination “to his own happiness”
Enter Input : (which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan—no, Ivan could not
Enter Input : submit to her, and such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha
Enter Input : could not help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and
Enter Input : reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room.
Enter Input : Another idea, too, forced itself upon him: “What if she loved neither of
Enter Input : them—neither Ivan nor Dmitri?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts
Enter Input : and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month.
Enter Input : “What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?”
Enter Input : he thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was
Enter Input : impossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry
Enter Input : was of immense importance in his brothers’ lives and that a great deal
Enter Input : depended upon it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One reptile will devour the other,” Ivan had pronounced the day before,
Enter Input : speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as
Enter Input : a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he had known
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares
Enter Input : yesterday, but that only made it more important. If he felt like that,
Enter Input : what chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new
Enter Input : grounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of them
Enter Input : was Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them? He
Enter Input : loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of these
Enter Input : conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, and
Enter Input : Alyosha’s heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was always
Enter Input : of an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If he loved any
Enter Input : one, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so he must know what he
Enter Input : was aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and having
Enter Input : ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of
Enter Input : a definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all
Enter Input : sides. “It was lacerating,” as was said just now. But what could he
Enter Input : understand even in this “laceration”? He did not understand the first word
Enter Input : in this perplexing maze.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan, who
Enter Input : had already got up to go, “A minute! Stay another minute! I want to hear
Enter Input : the opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Don’t go away,”
Enter Input : she added, addressing Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside
Enter Input : her, and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear friends,”
Enter Input : she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of
Enter Input : suffering, and Alyosha’s heart warmed to her at once. “You, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene, and saw
Enter Input : what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did. What he thought
Enter Input : of me yesterday I don’t know. I only know one thing, that if it were
Enter Input : repeated to-day, this minute, I should express the same feelings again as
Enter Input : yesterday—the same feelings, the same words, the same actions. You
Enter Input : remember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them”
Enter Input : ... (as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). “I must tell you
Enter Input : that I can’t get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don’t even know
Enter Input : whether I still love _him_. I feel _pity_ for him, and that is a poor sign
Enter Input : of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I shouldn’t be
Enter Input : sorry for him now, but should hate him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha
Enter Input : shuddered inwardly. “That girl is truthful and sincere,” he thought, “and
Enter Input : she does not love Dmitri any more.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true, that’s true,” cried Madame Hohlakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait, dear. I haven’t told you the chief, the final decision I came to
Enter Input : during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one—for
Enter Input : me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it—nothing. It
Enter Input : will be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful and generous adviser,
Enter Input : the one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep
Enter Input : insight into the heart, approves and commends my decision. He knows it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I approve of it,” Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive my
Enter Input : calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, to
Enter Input : tell me before my two friends whether I am right. I feel instinctively
Enter Input : that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are a dear brother to me),”
Enter Input : she said again ecstatically, taking his cold hand in her hot one, “I
Enter Input : foresee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in spite
Enter Input : of all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and submit—I
Enter Input : feel that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know what you are asking me,” said Alyosha, flushing. “I only
Enter Input : know that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than
Enter Input : my own!... But I know nothing about such affairs,” something impelled him
Enter Input : to add hurriedly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing is
Enter Input : honor and duty and something higher—I don’t know what—but higher perhaps
Enter Input : even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart,
Enter Input : and it compels me irresistibly. But it may all be put in two words. I’ve
Enter Input : already decided, even if he marries that—creature,” she began solemnly,
Enter Input : “whom I never, never can forgive, _even then I will not abandon him_.
Enter Input : Henceforward I will never, never abandon him!” she cried, breaking into a
Enter Input : sort of pale, hysterical ecstasy. “Not that I would run after him
Enter Input : continually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to
Enter Input : another town—where you like—but I will watch over him all my life—I will
Enter Input : watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy with that
Enter Input : woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let him come to me and he
Enter Input : will find a friend, a sister.... Only a sister, of course, and so for
Enter Input : ever; but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister,
Enter Input : who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him. I will gain my
Enter Input : point. I will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me,
Enter Input : without reserve,” she cried, in a sort of frenzy. “I will be a god to whom
Enter Input : he can pray—and that, at least, he owes me for his treachery and for what
Enter Input : I suffered yesterday through him. And let him see that all my life I will
Enter Input : be true to him and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue
Enter Input : and betraying me. I will—I will become nothing but a means for his
Enter Input : happiness, or—how shall I say?—an instrument, a machine for his happiness,
Enter Input : and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may see that all
Enter Input : his life! That’s my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea with more
Enter Input : dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried and crude. It
Enter Input : was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she was still
Enter Input : smarting from yesterday’s insult, and that her pride craved satisfaction.
Enter Input : She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look came
Enter Input : into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy. His
Enter Input : brother Ivan made it worse by adding:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve only expressed my own view,” he said. “From any one else, this would
Enter Input : have been affected and overstrained, but from you—no. Any other woman
Enter Input : would have been wrong, but you are right. I don’t know how to explain it,
Enter Input : but I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore, you are right.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But that’s only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for?
Enter Input : Nothing but yesterday’s insult.” Madame Hohlakov obviously had not
Enter Input : intended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very just
Enter Input : comment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite so, quite so,” cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously
Enter Input : annoyed at being interrupted, “in any one else this moment would be only
Enter Input : due to yesterday’s impression and would be only a moment. But with
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s character, that moment will last all her life. What
Enter Input : for any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting
Enter Input : burdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty. And she will be sustained
Enter Input : by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your
Enter Input : own heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will be
Enter Input : softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a
Enter Input : bold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any
Enter Input : case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of it will at last be a
Enter Input : source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything
Enter Input : else.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention;
Enter Input : even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with
Enter Input : intention.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!” Madame Hohlakov cried again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you will
Enter Input : say!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears. Alyosha got up from
Enter Input : the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s nothing, nothing!” she went on through her tears. “I’m upset, I
Enter Input : didn’t sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends as you and
Enter Input : your brother I still feel strong—for I know—you two will never desert me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow—perhaps to-morrow—and to leave
Enter Input : you for a long time—And, unluckily, it’s unavoidable,” Ivan said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To-morrow—to Moscow!” her face was suddenly contorted; “but—but, dear me,
Enter Input : how fortunate!” she cried in a voice suddenly changed. In one instant
Enter Input : there was no trace left of her tears. She underwent an instantaneous
Enter Input : transformation, which amazed Alyosha. Instead of a poor, insulted girl,
Enter Input : weeping in a sort of “laceration,” he saw a woman completely
Enter Input : self-possessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable
Enter Input : had just happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,” she corrected
Enter Input : herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. “Such a friend as you are
Enter Input : could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you.” She rushed
Enter Input : impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his hands, pressed them warmly. “But
Enter Input : what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and
Enter Input : Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position. You can
Enter Input : speak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will
Enter Input : know how to do that. You can’t think how wretched I was yesterday and this
Enter Input : morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter—for one can
Enter Input : never tell such things in a letter.... Now it will be easy for me to
Enter Input : write, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I am!
Enter Input : But I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can take your
Enter Input : place.... I will run at once to write the letter,” she finished suddenly,
Enter Input : and took a step as though to go out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so desperately
Enter Input : anxious to hear?” cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry note
Enter Input : in her voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I had not forgotten that,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a sudden
Enter Input : standstill, “and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?” she added,
Enter Input : with warm and bitter reproachfulness. “What I said, I repeat. I must have
Enter Input : his opinion. More than that, I must have his decision! As he says, so it
Enter Input : shall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch....
Enter Input : But what’s the matter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I couldn’t have believed it. I can’t understand it!” Alyosha cried
Enter Input : suddenly in distress.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? What?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You said that
Enter Input : on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but
Enter Input : sorry to be—losing a friend. But that was acting, too—you were playing a
Enter Input : part—as in a theater!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In a theater? What? What do you mean?” exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him, you persist
Enter Input : in telling him to his face that it’s fortunate he is going,” said Alyosha
Enter Input : breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not sit down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you talking about? I don’t understand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I am
Enter Input : not saying it properly, but I’ll say it all the same,” Alyosha went on in
Enter Input : the same shaking and broken voice. “What I see is that perhaps you don’t
Enter Input : love Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri,
Enter Input : too, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I really don’t know
Enter Input : how I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for
Enter Input : nobody here will tell the truth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What truth?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring in
Enter Input : her voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll tell you,” Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he were
Enter Input : jumping from the top of a house. “Call Dmitri; I will fetch him—and let
Enter Input : him come here and take your hand and take Ivan’s and join your hands. For
Enter Input : you’re torturing Ivan, simply because you love him—and torturing him,
Enter Input : because you love Dmitri through ‘self-laceration’—with an unreal
Enter Input : love—because you’ve persuaded yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha broke off and was silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot—that’s what you are!”
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving
Enter Input : with anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,” he said, with an expression Alyosha
Enter Input : had never seen in his face before—an expression of youthful sincerity and
Enter Input : strong, irresistibly frank feeling. “Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for
Enter Input : me! She has known all the time that I cared for her—though I never said a
Enter Input : word of my love to her—she knew, but she didn’t care for me. I have never
Enter Input : been her friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my
Enter Input : friendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged
Enter Input : with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receiving
Enter Input : from Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that first meeting
Enter Input : has rankled in her heart as an insult—that’s what her heart is like! She
Enter Input : has talked to me of nothing but her love for him. I am going now; but,
Enter Input : believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more he
Enter Input : insults you, the more you love him—that’s your ‘laceration.’ You love him
Enter Input : just as he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, you’d give
Enter Input : him up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as to
Enter Input : contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for
Enter Input : infidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there’s a great deal of
Enter Input : humiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride.... I
Enter Input : am too young and I’ve loved you too much. I know that I ought not to say
Enter Input : this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you, and
Enter Input : it would be less offensive for you. But I am going far away, and shall
Enter Input : never come back.... It is for ever. I don’t want to sit beside a
Enter Input : ‘laceration.’... But I don’t know how to speak now. I’ve said
Enter Input : everything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna; you can’t be angry with me, for
Enter Input : I am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the fact
Enter Input : that I shall never see you again. Good-by! I don’t want your hand. You
Enter Input : have tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this
Enter Input : moment. I shall forgive you later, but now I don’t want your hand. ‘Den
Enter Input : Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,’ ” he added, with a forced smile, showing,
Enter Input : however, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he knew him by
Enter Input : heart—which Alyosha would never have believed. He went out of the room
Enter Input : without saying good-by even to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha
Enter Input : clasped his hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan!” he cried desperately after him. “Come back, Ivan! No, nothing will
Enter Input : induce him to come back now!” he cried again, regretfully realizing it;
Enter Input : “but it’s my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly.
Enter Input : Unjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come back,” Alyosha kept
Enter Input : exclaiming frantically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,” Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. “I will do my
Enter Input : utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, but
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble notes in
Enter Input : her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she began,
Enter Input : addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though
Enter Input : nothing had happened. “A week—yes, I think it was a week ago—Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action—a very ugly action.
Enter Input : There is a low tavern here, and in it he met that discharged officer, that
Enter Input : captain, whom your father used to employ in some business. Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this captain, seized him by the
Enter Input : beard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it,
Enter Input : in that insulting fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a
Enter Input : child, who is at the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and
Enter Input : begging for his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every
Enter Input : one laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think
Enter Input : without indignation of that disgraceful action of _his_ ... one of those
Enter Input : actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger
Enter Input : ... and in his passions! I can’t describe it even.... I can’t find my
Enter Input : words. I’ve made inquiries about his victim, and find he is quite a poor
Enter Input : man. His name is Snegiryov. He did something wrong in the army and was
Enter Input : discharged. I can’t tell you what. And now he has sunk into terrible
Enter Input : destitution, with his family—an unhappy family of sick children, and, I
Enter Input : believe, an insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to
Enter Input : work as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought if you
Enter Input : ... that is I thought ... I don’t know. I am so confused. You see, I
Enter Input : wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find some
Enter Input : excuse to go to them—I mean to that captain—oh, goodness, how badly I
Enter Input : explain it!—and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to” (Alyosha
Enter Input : blushed), “manage to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles.
Enter Input : He will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,
Enter Input : rather, what do I mean? You see it’s not by way of compensation to prevent
Enter Input : him from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to), but simply a
Enter Input : token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch’s betrothed, not from himself.... But you know.... I would go
Enter Input : myself, but you’ll know how to do it ever so much better. He lives in Lake
Enter Input : Street, in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.... For God’s sake, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, do it for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired.
Enter Input : Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She turned and disappeared behind the portière so quickly that Alyosha had
Enter Input : not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to beg her
Enter Input : pardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was full and he
Enter Input : could not bear to go out of the room without it. But Madame Hohlakov took
Enter Input : him by the hand and drew him along with her. In the hall she stopped him
Enter Input : again as before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,
Enter Input : generous,” she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. “Oh, how I love her,
Enter Input : especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, you didn’t know, but I must tell you, that we all, all—both
Enter Input : her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even—have been hoping and praying for
Enter Input : nothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite Dmitri,
Enter Input : who takes no notice of her and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch—such an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her
Enter Input : more than anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it
Enter Input : about, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But she has been crying—she has been wounded again,” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never trust a woman’s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the
Enter Input : women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, you are spoiling him,” Lise’s little voice cried from behind the
Enter Input : door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,” Alyosha repeated
Enter Input : unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his
Enter Input : indiscretion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready
Enter Input : to say so a thousand times over.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?” Lise’s voice was heard again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I somehow fancied all at once,” Alyosha went on as though he had not
Enter Input : heard Lise, “that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing.... What
Enter Input : will happen now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To whom, to whom?” cried Lise. “Mamma, you really want to be the death of
Enter Input : me. I ask you and you don’t answer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the moment the maid ran in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is the matter?” cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. “Mamma, I
Enter Input : shall be having hysterics, and not she!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream, don’t persecute me. At your age one
Enter Input : can’t know everything that grown-up people know. I’ll come and tell you
Enter Input : everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am
Enter Input : coming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it’s an
Enter Input : excellent thing that she is hysterical. That’s just as it ought to be. In
Enter Input : such cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tears
Enter Input : and hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that I’ll fly to her. As for Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch’s going away like that, it’s her own fault. But he won’t go
Enter Input : away. Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream! Oh, yes; you are not
Enter Input : screaming. It’s I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted,
Enter Input : delighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how
Enter Input : young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said all
Enter Input : that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a _savant_, and all
Enter Input : of a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such
Enter Input : youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you.... And the way he
Enter Input : repeated that German verse, it was just like you! But I must fly, I must
Enter Input : fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her commission, and then
Enter Input : make haste back. Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy’s sake, don’t
Enter Input : keep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened
Enter Input : the door to see Lise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On no account,” cried Lise. “On no account now. Speak through the door.
Enter Input : How have you come to be an angel? That’s the only thing I want to know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t dare to go away like that!” Lise was beginning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise, I have a real sorrow! I’ll be back directly, but I have a great,
Enter Input : great sorrow!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he ran out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He had
Enter Input : rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love-affair. “But what do
Enter Input : I know about it? What can I tell about such things?” he repeated to
Enter Input : himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. “Oh, being ashamed would
Enter Input : be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall
Enter Input : certainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me to
Enter Input : reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them
Enter Input : together?” Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their
Enter Input : hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. “Though I acted quite
Enter Input : sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,” he concluded suddenly,
Enter Input : and did not even smile at his conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother
Enter Input : Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided to
Enter Input : go to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a
Enter Input : presentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he
Enter Input : would intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow.
Enter Input : Time was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for
Enter Input : one minute from the time he set off from the monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna’s commission; when she had mentioned the captain’s son, the
Enter Input : little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at
Enter Input : once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his
Enter Input : finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. Now
Enter Input : Alyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have said
Enter Input : why. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think no
Enter Input : more about the “mischief” he had done, and not to torture himself with
Enter Input : remorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thought
Enter Input : he was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he
Enter Input : felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from his
Enter Input : father’s, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, his
Enter Input : son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha. “He
Enter Input : hasn’t slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone away,” the
Enter Input : old man said in answer to Alyosha’s persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that
Enter Input : he was answering in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he
Enter Input : were not at Grushenka’s or in hiding at Foma’s (Alyosha spoke so freely on
Enter Input : purpose), all three looked at him in alarm. “They are fond of him, they
Enter Input : are doing their best for him,” thought Alyosha. “That’s good.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house,
Enter Input : sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a
Enter Input : muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed the
Enter Input : yard and found the door opening into the passage. On the left of the
Enter Input : passage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Both
Enter Input : seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one
Enter Input : of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and
Enter Input : pointed to a door across the passage. The captain’s lodging turned out to
Enter Input : be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open
Enter Input : the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna’s words that the man had a family. “Either they are all
Enter Input : asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open
Enter Input : the door. I’d better knock first,” and he knocked. An answer came, but not
Enter Input : at once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who’s there?” shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himself
Enter Input : in a regular peasant’s room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up with
Enter Input : domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. On
Enter Input : the left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on the
Enter Input : left was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags
Enter Input : hanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and
Enter Input : left, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of
Enter Input : four print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the
Enter Input : other there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was
Enter Input : screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain
Enter Input : could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square table
Enter Input : of plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three windows,
Enter Input : which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little
Enter Input : light, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather
Enter Input : stuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs,
Enter Input : a half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a
Enter Input : chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunken
Enter Input : cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what struck
Enter Input : Alyosha most was the expression in the poor woman’s eyes—a look of
Enter Input : surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking to
Enter Input : her husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with
Enter Input : the same haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the window
Enter Input : stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but
Enter Input : very neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.
Enter Input : Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad
Enter Input : sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled “with
Enter Input : withered legs,” as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches stood in the
Enter Input : corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor
Enter Input : girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting
Enter Input : at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weakly
Enter Input : built. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very much
Enter Input : like a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase “a wisp of tow” flashed
Enter Input : at once into Alyosha’s mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).
Enter Input : It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there was no
Enter Input : other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from the
Enter Input : bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged
Enter Input : napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!” the
Enter Input : girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round instantly
Enter Input : towards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,” he turned again to Alyosha,
Enter Input : “what has brought you to—our retreat?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen him.
Enter Input : There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him. Though he
Enter Input : had obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There was
Enter Input : extraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at the
Enter Input : same time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been kept in
Enter Input : subjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was
Enter Input : trying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wants
Enter Input : dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In his
Enter Input : words and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy
Enter Input : humor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting
Enter Input : from one tone to another. The question about “our retreat” he had asked as
Enter Input : it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close to
Enter Input : Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed in a very
Enter Input : shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore checked trousers of
Enter Input : an extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material.
Enter Input : They were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grown
Enter Input : out of them like a boy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am Alexey Karamazov,” Alyosha began in reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I quite understand that, sir,” the gentleman snapped out at once to
Enter Input : assure him that he knew who he was already. “I am Captain Snegiryov, sir,
Enter Input : but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I’ve come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you—if
Enter Input : only you allow me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That’s what they
Enter Input : used to say in the old comedies, ‘kindly be seated,’ ” and with a rapid
Enter Input : gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, not
Enter Input : upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then,
Enter Input : taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha, so
Enter Input : close to him that their knees almost touched.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian
Enter Input : infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I might
Enter Input : not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life I’ve
Enter Input : learnt to say ‘sir.’ It’s a word you use when you’ve come down in the
Enter Input : world.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s very true,” smiled Alyosha. “But is it used involuntarily or on
Enter Input : purpose?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As God’s above, it’s involuntary, and I usen’t to use it! I didn’t use
Enter Input : the word ‘sir’ all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I began
Enter Input : to say ‘sir.’ It’s the work of a higher power. I see you are interested in
Enter Input : contemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, living
Enter Input : as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve come—about that business.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “About what business?” the captain interrupted impatiently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Alyosha blurted
Enter Input : out awkwardly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What meeting, sir? You don’t mean that meeting? About my ‘wisp of tow,’
Enter Input : then?” He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against
Enter Input : Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What wisp of tow?” muttered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is come to complain of me, father!” cried a voice familiar to
Enter Input : Alyosha—the voice of the schoolboy—from behind the curtain. “I bit his
Enter Input : finger just now.” The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailant
Enter Input : lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner
Enter Input : under the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt.
Enter Input : He was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a
Enter Input : fever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home
Enter Input : and could not be touched.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What! Did he bite your finger?” The captain jumped up from his chair.
Enter Input : “Was it your finger he bit?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of them
Enter Input : against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me and then
Enter Input : another at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And then he rushed
Enter Input : at me and bit my finger badly, I don’t know why.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll thrash him, sir, at once—this minute!” The captain jumped up from
Enter Input : his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I don’t want
Enter Input : him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you suppose I’d thrash him? That I’d take my Ilusha and thrash him
Enter Input : before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?”
Enter Input : said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were going to
Enter Input : attack him. “I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashing
Enter Input : Ilusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here
Enter Input : before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers
Enter Input : would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won’t ask for
Enter Input : the fifth one too?” He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every
Enter Input : feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely
Enter Input : defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think I understand it all now,” said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,
Enter Input : still keeping his seat. “So your boy is a good boy, he loves his father,
Enter Input : and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I understand
Enter Input : it,” he repeated thoughtfully. “But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets
Enter Input : his action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him to come to
Enter Input : you, or better still, to meet you in that same place, he will ask your
Enter Input : forgiveness before every one—if you wish it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And he
Enter Input : thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn’t he?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way you
Enter Input : like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in
Enter Input : that very tavern—‘The Metropolis’ it’s called—or in the market-place, he
Enter Input : would do it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he would even go down on his knees.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced me
Enter Input : to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother’s generosity. Allow
Enter Input : me to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son—my litter. If I
Enter Input : die, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for a
Enter Input : wretch like me? That’s a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man
Enter Input : of my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man like
Enter Input : me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, that’s perfectly true!” exclaimed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us to
Enter Input : shame!” cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father with
Enter Input : a disdainful and contemptuous air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait a little, Varvara!” cried her father, speaking peremptorily but
Enter Input : looking at her quite approvingly. “That’s her character,” he said,
Enter Input : addressing Alyosha again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “And in all nature there was naught
Enter Input :     That could find favor in his eyes—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : or rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now let
Enter Input : me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is
Enter Input : forty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. Arina
Enter Input : Petrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
Enter Input : Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.” He took him by the hand and with unexpected
Enter Input : force pulled him up. “You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It’s
Enter Input : not the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h’m ... etcetera, but his brother,
Enter Input : radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first your
Enter Input : hand to be kissed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he kissed his wife’s hand respectfully and even tenderly. The girl at
Enter Input : the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression of
Enter Input : extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the
Enter Input : woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,” she said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,” he whispered
Enter Input : again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of
Enter Input : Tchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me crippled,
Enter Input : but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled up
Enter Input : myself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it’s as though I had swallowed a
Enter Input : needle.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are of humble origin,” the captain muttered again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, father, father!” the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent on
Enter Input : her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Buffoon!” blurted out the girl at the window.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you heard our news?” said the mother, pointing at her daughters.
Enter Input : “It’s like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again.
Enter Input : When we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don’t mean
Enter Input : to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon’s wife used
Enter Input : to come then and say, ‘Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest
Enter Input : heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,’ she would say, ‘is of the brood of hell.’
Enter Input : ‘Well,’ I said, ‘that’s a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.’
Enter Input : ‘And you want keeping in your place,’ says she. ‘You black sword,’ said I,
Enter Input : ‘who asked you to teach me?’ ‘But my breath,’ says she, ‘is clean, and
Enter Input : yours is unclean.’ ‘You ask all the officers whether my breath is
Enter Input : unclean.’ And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long ago I was
Enter Input : sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who came
Enter Input : here for Easter, and I asked him: ‘Your Excellency,’ said I, ‘can a lady’s
Enter Input : breath be unpleasant?’ ‘Yes,’ he answered; ‘you ought to open a
Enter Input : window-pane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.’ And they all
Enter Input : go on like that! And what is my breath to them? The dead smell worse
Enter Input : still! ‘I won’t spoil the air,’ said I, ‘I’ll order some slippers and go
Enter Input : away.’ My darlings, don’t blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is
Enter Input : it I can’t please you? There’s only Ilusha who comes home from school and
Enter Input : loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own
Enter Input : mother—forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasant
Enter Input : to you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her
Enter Input : cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves
Enter Input : you, every one adores you.” He began kissing both her hands again and
Enter Input : tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he began wiping away
Enter Input : her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes. “There, you
Enter Input : see, you hear?” he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the
Enter Input : poor imbecile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I see and hear,” muttered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, father, how can you—with him! Let him alone!” cried the boy,
Enter Input : sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead to
Enter Input : anything!” shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I’ll make haste to
Enter Input : satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I’ll put on
Enter Input : mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but not
Enter Input : within these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgot
Enter Input : to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who has
Enter Input : flown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!” Varvara
Enter Input : went on indignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now, she
Enter Input : is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call me so.
Enter Input : Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, snatching Alyosha’s hand, he drew him out of the room into the
Enter Input : street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. And In The Open Air
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the
Enter Input : word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I too have something important to say to you,” observed Alyosha, “only I
Enter Input : don’t know how to begin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked in
Enter Input : upon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of the
Enter Input : boy, and that’s hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I could not
Enter Input : explain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you. My
Enter Input : tow was thicker a week ago—I mean my beard. That’s the nickname they give
Enter Input : to my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I’d done nothing, he was in a
Enter Input : towering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of the
Enter Input : tavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out of
Enter Input : school, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state he
Enter Input : rushed up to me. ‘Father,’ he cried, ‘father!’ He caught hold of me,
Enter Input : hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, ‘Let go, let go,
Enter Input : it’s my father, forgive him!’—yes, he actually cried ‘forgive him.’ He
Enter Input : clutched at that hand, that very hand, in his little hands and kissed
Enter Input : it.... I remember his little face at that moment, I haven’t forgotten it
Enter Input : and I never shall!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I swear,” cried Alyosha, “that my brother will express his most deep and
Enter Input : sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that same
Enter Input : market-place.... I’ll make him or he is no brother of mine!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aha, then it’s only a suggestion! And it does not come from him but
Enter Input : simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have said
Enter Input : so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother’s highly
Enter Input : chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at the
Enter Input : time. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: ‘You are an
Enter Input : officer,’ he said, ‘and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man to
Enter Input : be your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though
Enter Input : you are a scoundrel.’ That’s what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I
Enter Input : retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever
Enter Input : on Ilusha’s soul. No, it’s not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen.
Enter Input : Judge for yourself. You’ve just been in our mansion, what did you see
Enter Input : there? Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and
Enter Input : hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a student,
Enter Input : dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the
Enter Input : Russian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won’t speak of Ilusha, he is
Enter Input : only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all
Enter Input : of them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me on
Enter Input : the spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if he
Enter Input : doesn’t kill me but only cripples me: I couldn’t work, but I should still
Enter Input : be a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I
Enter Input : take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That’s what it
Enter Input : means for me to challenge him to a duel. It’s silly talk and nothing
Enter Input : else.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the middle
Enter Input : of the market-place,” cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did think of prosecuting him,” the captain went on, “but look in our
Enter Input : code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And then
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna(3) sent for me and shouted at me: ‘Don’t dare to
Enter Input : dream of it! If you proceed against him, I’ll publish it to all the world
Enter Input : that he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.’ I
Enter Input : call God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I
Enter Input : acted, wasn’t it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch’s? ‘And what’s more,’
Enter Input : she went on, ‘I’ll dismiss you for good and you’ll never earn another
Enter Input : penny from me. I’ll speak to my merchant too’ (that’s what she calls her
Enter Input : old man) ‘and he will dismiss you!’ And if he dismisses me, what can I
Enter Input : earn then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another
Enter Input : reason, but he means to make use of papers I’ve signed to go to law
Enter Input : against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But now
Enter Input : let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much? I didn’t like to go into
Enter Input : it in our mansion before him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me as
Enter Input : a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was throwing
Enter Input : stones at his school-fellows! It’s very dangerous. They might kill him.
Enter Input : They are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebody’s
Enter Input : head.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to-day. Not
Enter Input : on the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home crying
Enter Input : and groaning and now he is ill.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on your
Enter Input : account. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife not
Enter Input : long ago.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve heard about that too, it’s dangerous. Krassotkin is an official
Enter Input : here, we may hear more about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I would advise you,” Alyosha went on warmly, “not to send him to school
Enter Input : at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is passed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Anger!” the captain repeated, “that’s just what it is. He is a little
Enter Input : creature, but it’s a mighty anger. You don’t know all, sir. Let me tell
Enter Input : you more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about the
Enter Input : ‘wisp of tow.’ Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are
Enter Input : angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless.
Enter Input : Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy,
Enter Input : a weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his father, sir,
Enter Input : but he stood up for his father against them all. For his father and for
Enter Input : truth and justice. For what he suffered when he kissed your brother’s hand
Enter Input : and cried to him ‘Forgive father, forgive him,’—that only God knows—and I,
Enter Input : his father. For our children—not your children, but ours—the children of
Enter Input : the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one—know what justice means,
Enter Input : sir, even at nine years old. How should the rich know? They don’t explore
Enter Input : such depths once in their lives. But at that moment in the square when he
Enter Input : kissed his hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice
Enter Input : means. That truth entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,” the
Enter Input : captain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right
Enter Input : fist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how “the truth”
Enter Input : crushed Ilusha. “That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was
Enter Input : delirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I
Enter Input : noticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the
Enter Input : window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mind
Enter Input : was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful
Enter Input : man as I am, and I don’t remember much. Mamma began crying, too—I am very
Enter Input : fond of mamma—well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don’t
Enter Input : despise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best
Enter Input : men amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don’t remember
Enter Input : about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at
Enter Input : school. ‘Wisp of tow,’ they shouted, ‘your father was pulled out of the
Enter Input : tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale and
Enter Input : wretched. ‘What is it?’ I asked. He wouldn’t answer. Well, there’s no
Enter Input : talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it.
Enter Input : What’s more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara had
Enter Input : begun snarling. ‘You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything
Enter Input : rational?’ ‘Quite so,’ I said, ‘can we ever do anything rational?’ For the
Enter Input : time I turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a
Enter Input : walk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same
Enter Input : way, along which we are going now—from our gate to that great stone which
Enter Input : lies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of the
Enter Input : town pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along
Enter Input : hand in hand as usual. He has a little hand, his fingers are thin and
Enter Input : cold—he suffers with his chest, you know. ‘Father,’ said he, ‘father!’
Enter Input : ‘Well?’ said I. I saw his eyes flashing. ‘Father, how he treated you
Enter Input : then!’ ‘It can’t be helped, Ilusha,’ I said. ‘Don’t forgive him, father,
Enter Input : don’t forgive him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for
Enter Input : it.’ ‘No, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘I would not take money from him for anything.’
Enter Input : Then he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it
Enter Input : again. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘father, challenge him to a duel, at school they
Enter Input : say you are a coward and won’t challenge him, and that you’ll accept ten
Enter Input : roubles from him.’ ‘I can’t challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,’ I answered.
Enter Input : And I told briefly what I’ve just told you. He listened. ‘Father,’ he
Enter Input : said, ‘anyway don’t forgive it. When I grow up I’ll call him out myself
Enter Input : and kill him.’ His eyes shone and glowed. And of course I am his father,
Enter Input : and I had to put in a word: ‘It’s a sin to kill,’ I said, ‘even in a
Enter Input : duel.’ ‘Father,’ he said, ‘when I grow up, I’ll knock him down, knock the
Enter Input : sword out of his hand, I’ll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say:
Enter Input : “I could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!” ’ You see what the
Enter Input : workings of his little mind have been during these two days; he must have
Enter Input : been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about it
Enter Input : the day before yesterday, and you are right, I won’t send him to that
Enter Input : school any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the class
Enter Input : alone and defying them all, that his heart was full of resentment, of
Enter Input : bitterness—I was alarmed about him. We went for another walk. ‘Father,’ he
Enter Input : asked, ‘are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?’ ‘Yes,
Enter Input : Ilusha,’ I said, ‘there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.’
Enter Input : ‘Father,’ he said, ‘I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer
Enter Input : everybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one
Enter Input : will dare—’ Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling.
Enter Input : ‘Father,’ he said, ‘what a horrid town this is.’ ‘Yes, Ilusha,’ I said,
Enter Input : ‘it isn’t a very nice town.’ ‘Father, let us move into another town, a
Enter Input : nice one,’ he said, ‘where people don’t know about us.’ ‘We will move, we
Enter Input : will, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘only I must save up for it.’ I was glad to be able
Enter Input : to turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we
Enter Input : would move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. ‘We will
Enter Input : put mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we’ll walk,
Enter Input : you shall have a lift now and then, and I’ll walk beside, for we must take
Enter Input : care of our horse, we can’t all ride. That’s how we’ll go.’ He was
Enter Input : enchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and
Enter Input : driving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We
Enter Input : chattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind and
Enter Input : comforted him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night
Enter Input : everything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came back
Enter Input : depressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the hand and
Enter Input : we went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no
Enter Input : sun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along,
Enter Input : both of us depressed. ‘Well, my boy,’ said I, ‘how about our setting off
Enter Input : on our travels?’ I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day
Enter Input : before. He didn’t answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand. Ah,
Enter Input : I thought, it’s a bad job; there’s something fresh. We had reached the
Enter Input : stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And in the air there were
Enter Input : lots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty in
Enter Input : sight. Of course, it’s just the season for the kites. ‘Look, Ilusha,’ said
Enter Input : I, ‘it’s time we got out our last year’s kite again. I’ll mend it, where
Enter Input : have you put it away?’ My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned
Enter Input : sideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell
Enter Input : on me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You
Enter Input : know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears
Enter Input : when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall
Enter Input : in streams. With those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face.
Enter Input : He sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up
Enter Input : against me as I sat on the stone. ‘Father,’ he kept crying, ‘dear father,
Enter Input : how he insulted you!’ And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other’s
Enter Input : arms. ‘Ilusha,’ I said to him, ‘Ilusha darling.’ No one saw us then. God
Enter Input : alone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your
Enter Input : brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won’t thrash my boy for your
Enter Input : satisfaction.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha
Enter Input : felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else
Enter Input : in his, Alyosha’s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would
Enter Input : not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart
Enter Input : was trembling on the verge of tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!” he cried. “If you
Enter Input : could arrange it—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly, sir,” muttered the captain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But now listen to something quite different!” Alyosha went on. “I have a
Enter Input : message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his
Enter Input : betrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I
Enter Input : have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for
Enter Input : hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate
Enter Input : position, she commissioned me at once—just now—to bring you this help from
Enter Input : her—but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor
Enter Input : from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her!
Enter Input : She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the
Enter Input : same man. She thought of you only when she had just received a similar
Enter Input : insult from him—similar in its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister to
Enter Input : help a brother in misfortune.... She told me to persuade you to take these
Enter Input : two hundred roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in
Enter Input : such need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander.
Enter Input : There are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them
Enter Input : unless—unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothers
Enter Input : even on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, you
Enter Input : must,” and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence,
Enter Input : and there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendous
Enter Input : impression on the captain. He started, but at first only from
Enter Input : astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he
Enter Input : expected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from
Enter Input : any one—and such a sum!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer, quite
Enter Input : a new expression came into his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That for me? So much money—two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I
Enter Input : haven’t seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And she
Enter Input : says she is a sister.... And is that the truth?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I swear that all I told you is the truth,” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The captain flushed red.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan’t be behaving like a
Enter Input : scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan’t be a scoundrel? No,
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,” he hurried, touching Alyosha with
Enter Input : both his hands. “You are persuading me to take it, saying that it’s a
Enter Input : sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won’t you feel contempt for
Enter Input : me if I take it, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan’t! And no one will ever know but
Enter Input : me—I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this
Enter Input : you must listen, for you can’t understand what these two hundred roubles
Enter Input : mean to me now.” The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of
Enter Input : incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown off his balance and
Enter Input : talked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be allowed to say all
Enter Input : he had to say.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Besides its being honestly acquired from a ‘sister,’ so highly respected
Enter Input : and revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my
Enter Input : hunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of
Enter Input : his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. ‘I can make
Enter Input : nothing of it,’ said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept
Enter Input : at a chemist’s here. He said it would be sure to do her good, and he
Enter Input : ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral water costs
Enter Input : thirty copecks, and she’d need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I took
Enter Input : the prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it
Enter Input : lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them,
Enter Input : morning and evening. But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion,
Enter Input : without servants, without help, without a bath, and without water? Nina is
Enter Input : rheumatic all over, I don’t think I told you that. All her right side
Enter Input : aches at night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel
Enter Input : bears it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get,
Enter Input : and she’ll only take the leavings, what you’d scarcely give to a dog. ‘I
Enter Input : am not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,’ that’s
Enter Input : what her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesn’t like
Enter Input : it. ‘I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.’ As though she were not
Enter Input : worth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness.
Enter Input : Without her, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! She
Enter Input : softens even Varvara. And don’t judge Varvara harshly either, she is an
Enter Input : angel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer,
Enter Input : and she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to
Enter Input : go back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took her
Enter Input : money and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Though
Enter Input : indeed she couldn’t go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. She
Enter Input : is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits on us
Enter Input : all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma is
Enter Input : capricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant with this
Enter Input : money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the
Enter Input : dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I can
Enter Input : feed them properly. Good Lord, but it’s a dream!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that the
Enter Input : poor fellow had consented to be made happy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,” the captain began to talk with frenzied
Enter Input : rapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. “Do you know that Ilusha and I
Enter Input : will perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, a
Enter Input : black horse, he insists on its being black, and we will set off as we
Enter Input : pretended the other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province,
Enter Input : and I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he’d give me a
Enter Input : place as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I’d just
Enter Input : put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I’d walk, I’d
Enter Input : walk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that’s owing me,
Enter Input : I should have perhaps enough for that too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There would be enough!” cried Alyosha. “Katerina Ivanovna will send you
Enter Input : as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what you
Enter Input : want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it back
Enter Input : later.... (You’ll get rich, you’ll get rich!) And you know you couldn’t
Enter Input : have a better idea than to move to another province! It would be the
Enter Input : saving of you, especially of your boy—and you ought to go quickly, before
Enter Input : the winter, before the cold. You must write to us when you are there, and
Enter Input : we will always be brothers.... No, it’s not a dream!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him he
Enter Input : stopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and his
Enter Input : lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving as
Enter Input : though trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his lips
Enter Input : moved. It was uncanny.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it?” asked Alyosha, startled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,” muttered the captain, faltering,
Enter Input : looking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate
Enter Input : resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips. “I ...
Enter Input : you, sir ... wouldn’t you like me to show you a little trick I know?” he
Enter Input : murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no longer
Enter Input : faltering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What trick?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A pretty trick,” whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted on the left
Enter Input : side, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is the matter? What trick?” Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, look,” squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes
Enter Input : which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger
Enter Input : during the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them
Enter Input : tight in his right hand. “Do you see, do you see?” he shrieked, pale and
Enter Input : infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notes
Enter Input : on the sand. “Do you see?” he shrieked again, pointing to them. “Look
Enter Input : there!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping and
Enter Input : exclaiming as he did so:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money!
Enter Input : So much for your money!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his whole
Enter Input : figure expressed unutterable pride.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,” he
Enter Input : cried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began to
Enter Input : run; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and
Enter Input : kissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turned
Enter Input : round for the last time. This time his face was not contorted with
Enter Input : laughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering,
Enter Input : sobbing voice he cried:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,
Enter Input : inexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the man
Enter Input : had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did not
Enter Input : turn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and call him
Enter Input : back, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two
Enter Input : notes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into
Enter Input : the sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha
Enter Input : unfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he folded
Enter Input : them up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on
Enter Input : the success of her commission.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book V. Pro And Contra
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. The Engagement
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered;
Enter Input : something important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna’s hysterics had ended
Enter Input : in a fainting fit, and then “a terrible, awful weakness had followed, she
Enter Input : lay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever.
Enter Input : They had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts were
Enter Input : already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in
Enter Input : her room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain
Enter Input : fever!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. “This is serious, serious,” she
Enter Input : added at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before had
Enter Input : been serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to
Enter Input : describe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words. She
Enter Input : had not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her
Enter Input : there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lise,” she whispered almost in his ear, “Lise has greatly surprised me
Enter Input : just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heart
Enter Input : forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began to
Enter Input : be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though
Enter Input : she was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry
Enter Input : for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never
Enter Input : been really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And
Enter Input : you know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in
Enter Input : earnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
Enter Input : don’t take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am never
Enter Input : hard upon her, for she’s such a clever little thing. Would you believe it?
Enter Input : She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, ‘the greatest
Enter Input : friend of her childhood’—just think of that—‘greatest friend’—and what
Enter Input : about me? She has very strong feelings and memories, and, what’s more, she
Enter Input : uses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden
Enter Input : when you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for
Enter Input : instance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early
Enter Input : childhood. Very likely it’s standing there still; so there’s no need to
Enter Input : speak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, they don’t change quickly. ‘Mamma,’ she said, ‘I remember
Enter Input : this pine-tree as in a dream,’ only she said something so original about
Enter Input : it that I can’t repeat it. Besides, I’ve forgotten it. Well, good-by! I am
Enter Input : so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I’ve
Enter Input : been out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as you
Enter Input : always can so charmingly. Lise,” she cried, going to her door, “here I’ve
Enter Input : brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at all
Enter Input : angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you could
Enter Input : suppose so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed
Enter Input : crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do
Enter Input : in such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as though
Enter Input : they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told
Enter Input : me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know,
Enter Input : although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to
Enter Input : another ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the money and how
Enter Input : is that poor man getting on?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The fact is I didn’t give it to him, and it’s a long story,” answered
Enter Input : Alyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret at
Enter Input : having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away, and
Enter Input : that he, too, was trying to talk of other things.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the
Enter Input : first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise’s
Enter Input : attention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of the
Enter Input : strong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling his
Enter Input : story well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been fond of
Enter Input : coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him, what
Enter Input : he had read, or what he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had
Enter Input : made day-dreams and woven whole romances together—generally cheerful and
Enter Input : amusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in
Enter Input : Moscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyosha
Enter Input : described Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how the
Enter Input : luckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her hands
Enter Input : and crying out:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you didn’t give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, you
Enter Input : ought to have run after him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Lise; it’s better I didn’t run after him,” said Alyosha, getting up
Enter Input : from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is
Enter Input : hopeless?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them. He’ll
Enter Input : take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to take it,” said
Enter Input : Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. “You see, Lise,” he went on,
Enter Input : stopping suddenly before her, “I made one blunder, but that, even that, is
Enter Input : all for the best.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What blunder, and why is it for the best?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he has
Enter Input : suffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why he took
Enter Input : offense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did not
Enter Input : know that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now that there
Enter Input : was a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise in
Enter Input : his position.... To begin with, he was sore at having been so glad of the
Enter Input : money in my presence and not having concealed it from me. If he had been
Enter Input : pleased, but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun
Enter Input : affecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take
Enter Input : money, he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinely
Enter Input : delighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful
Enter Input : man—that’s the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, his
Enter Input : voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept laughing
Enter Input : such a laugh, or perhaps he was crying—yes, I am sure he was crying, he
Enter Input : was so delighted—and he talked about his daughters—and about the situation
Enter Input : he could get in another town.... And when he had poured out his heart, he
Enter Input : felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to
Enter Input : hate me at once. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What
Enter Input : had made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and
Enter Input : accepted me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried
Enter Input : to intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing
Enter Input : me; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came to
Enter Input : feel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very important
Enter Input : one. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to
Enter Input : another town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give
Enter Input : him as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once.
Enter Input : Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise,
Enter Input : it’s awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look
Enter Input : at him as though they were his benefactors.... I’ve heard that; Father
Enter Input : Zossima told me so. I don’t know how to put it, but I have often seen it
Enter Input : myself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of it was that
Enter Input : though he did not know, up to the very last minute, that he would trample
Enter Input : on the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that.
Enter Input : That’s just what made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment....
Enter Input : And though it’s so dreadful, it’s all for the best. In fact, I believe
Enter Input : nothing better could have happened.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, why could nothing better have happened?” cried Lise, looking with
Enter Input : great surprise at Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he
Enter Input : would be crying with mortification, that’s just what would have happened.
Enter Input : And most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps have
Enter Input : flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now. But now
Enter Input : he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he knows he has
Enter Input : ‘ruined himself.’ So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept
Enter Input : the two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his
Enter Input : honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot.... He couldn’t
Enter Input : know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yet
Enter Input : he is in terrible need of that money. Though he is proud of himself now,
Enter Input : yet even to-day he’ll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will think
Enter Input : of it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning
Enter Input : he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. It’s just then that I’ll
Enter Input : appear. ‘Here, you are a proud man,’ I shall say: ‘you have shown it; but
Enter Input : now take the money and forgive us!’ And then he will take it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, “And then
Enter Input : he will take it!” Lise clapped her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, that’s true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you
Enter Input : know all this? So young and yet he knows what’s in the heart.... I should
Enter Input : never have worked it out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing
Enter Input : with us, in spite of his taking money from us,” Alyosha went on in his
Enter Input : excitement, “and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘On a higher footing’ is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, go
Enter Input : on!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You mean there isn’t such an expression as ‘on a higher footing’; but
Enter Input : that doesn’t matter because—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, of course it doesn’t matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You
Enter Input : know, I scarcely respected you till now—that is I respected you but on an
Enter Input : equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing.
Enter Input : Don’t be angry, dear, at my joking,” she put in at once, with strong
Enter Input : feeling. “I am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch. Isn’t there in all our analysis—I mean your analysis ... no,
Enter Input : better call it ours—aren’t we showing contempt for him, for that poor
Enter Input : man—in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? In
Enter Input : deciding so certainly that he will take the money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Lise, it’s not contempt,” Alyosha answered, as though he had prepared
Enter Input : himself for the question. “I was thinking of that on the way here. How can
Enter Input : it be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all just the same as
Enter Input : he is? For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, we
Enter Input : should have been just the same in his place.... I don’t know about you,
Enter Input : Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul
Enter Input : is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have
Enter Input : no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care for
Enter Input : most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one
Enter Input : would for the sick in hospitals.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the
Enter Input : sick!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. I
Enter Input : am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don’t see things. It’s
Enter Input : different with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, I don’t believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am so glad you say so, Lise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sort
Enter Input : of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door,
Enter Input : open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,” said Lise, in a
Enter Input : nervous, hurried whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Lise went on, flushing redder and
Enter Input : redder. “Give me your hand—that’s right. I have to make a great
Enter Input : confession, I didn’t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,” and
Enter Input : she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly
Enter Input : ashamed of the confession.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Lise, what a good thing!” cried Alyosha joyfully. “You know, I was
Enter Input : perfectly sure you were in earnest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sure? Upon my word!” She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it,
Enter Input : blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. “I kiss his hand and he
Enter Input : says, ‘What a good thing!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don’t know how to do it,”
Enter Input : he muttered, blushing too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as his
Enter Input : wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What a
Enter Input : thing to say! Why, that’s impertinence—that’s what it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?” Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,” cried Lise,
Enter Input : looking tenderly and happily at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down and
Enter Input : kissed her on her lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, what are you doing?” cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, forgive me if I shouldn’t.... Perhaps I’m awfully stupid.... You said
Enter Input : I was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. “And in that dress!” she
Enter Input : ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing and
Enter Input : became serious, almost stern.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and we
Enter Input : shall have a long time to wait,” she ended suddenly. “Tell me rather why
Enter Input : you who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a little
Enter Input : idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I don’t
Enter Input : deserve you a bit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days.
Enter Input : If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. _He_ told me to marry,
Enter Input : too. Whom could I marry better than you—and who would have me except you?
Enter Input : I have been thinking it over. In the first place, you’ve known me from a
Enter Input : child and you’ve a great many qualities I haven’t. You are more
Enter Input : light-hearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. I
Enter Input : have been brought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah, you
Enter Input : don’t know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do
Enter Input : laugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do.
Enter Input : You laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Like a martyr? How?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren’t showing contempt
Enter Input : for that poor man by dissecting his soul—that was the question of a
Enter Input : sufferer.... You see, I don’t know how to express it, but any one who
Enter Input : thinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your invalid
Enter Input : chair you must have thought over many things already.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?” murmured Lise in
Enter Input : a failing voice, weak with happiness. “Listen, Alyosha. What will you wear
Enter Input : when you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Don’t laugh, don’t
Enter Input : be angry, it’s very, very important to me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I haven’t thought about the suit, Lise; but I’ll wear whatever you like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piqué
Enter Input : waistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I
Enter Input : didn’t care for you when I said I didn’t mean what I wrote?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t believe it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, I knew that you—seemed to care for me, but I pretended to
Enter Input : believe that you didn’t care for me to make it—easier for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully
Enter Input : fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I
Enter Input : decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly
Enter Input : and gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean
Enter Input : that you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply a
Enter Input : stupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the
Enter Input : letter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as
Enter Input : not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it,
Enter Input : wasn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this
Enter Input : morning, in this pocket. Here it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I told a lie if you like,” Alyosha laughed, too. “I told a lie so as not
Enter Input : to give you back the letter. It’s very precious to me,” he added suddenly,
Enter Input : with strong feeling, and again he flushed. “It always will be, and I won’t
Enter Input : give it up to any one!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise looked at him joyfully. “Alyosha,” she murmured again, “look at the
Enter Input : door. Isn’t mamma listening?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well, Lise, I’ll look; but wouldn’t it be better not to look? Why
Enter Input : suspect your mother of such meanness?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it’s her right, it’s
Enter Input : not meanness!” cried Lise, firing up. “You may be sure, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself I
Enter Input : shall certainly spy on her!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Really, Lise? That’s not right.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were listening
Enter Input : to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness, but when her
Enter Input : own daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you know
Enter Input : I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married, and let me tell you I
Enter Input : shall open all your letters and read them, so you may as well be
Enter Input : prepared.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of course, if so—” muttered Alyosha, “only it’s not right.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won’t quarrel the very first day.
Enter Input : I’d better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it’s very wrong to spy on
Enter Input : people, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall spy on
Enter Input : you all the same.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do, then; you won’t find out anything,” laughed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most
Enter Input : important things. Even if you don’t agree with me, I shall do my duty in
Enter Input : the most important things.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only
Enter Input : in the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready to vow to
Enter Input : do so now—in everything, and for all my life!” cried Lise fervently, “and
Enter Input : I’ll do it gladly, gladly! What’s more, I’ll swear never to spy on you,
Enter Input : never once, never to read one of your letters. For you are right and I am
Enter Input : not. And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won’t do
Enter Input : it since you consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now....
Enter Input : Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately—both
Enter Input : yesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but I
Enter Input : see you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,” answered Alyosha mournfully. “I see
Enter Input : you love me, since you guessed that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What grief? What about? Can you tell me?” asked Lise with timid entreaty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll tell you later, Lise—afterwards,” said Alyosha, confused. “Now you
Enter Input : wouldn’t understand it perhaps—and perhaps I couldn’t explain it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, my brothers too,” murmured Alyosha, pondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,” said Lise suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My brothers are destroying themselves,” he went on, “my father, too. And
Enter Input : they are destroying others with them. It’s ‘the primitive force of the
Enter Input : Karamazovs,’ as Father Païssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled,
Enter Input : earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I
Enter Input : don’t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk!
Enter Input : Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I did.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And perhaps I don’t even believe in God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t believe? What is the matter?” said Lise quietly and gently. But
Enter Input : Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective
Enter Input : in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is
Enter Input : going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am
Enter Input : with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise....
Enter Input : For the future we will be together.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all
Enter Input : our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha kissed her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, now go. Christ be with you!” and she made the sign of the cross
Enter Input : over him. “Make haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see I’ve kept you
Enter Input : cruelly. I’ll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy!
Enter Input : Shall we be happy, shall we?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I believe we shall, Lise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going
Enter Input : out of the house without saying good-by to her. But no sooner had he
Enter Input : opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From
Enter Input : the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to
Enter Input : meet him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and
Enter Input : ridiculous. I trust you won’t dream—It’s foolishness, nothing but
Enter Input : foolishness!” she said, attacking him at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only don’t tell her that,” said Alyosha, “or she will be upset, and
Enter Input : that’s bad for her now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you
Enter Input : only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you
Enter Input : didn’t want to irritate her by contradiction?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,” Alyosha declared
Enter Input : stoutly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first place
Enter Input : I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you may
Enter Input : be sure of that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why?” asked Alyosha. “It’s all so far off. We may have to wait
Enter Input : another year and a half.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that’s true, of course, and you’ll have time to
Enter Input : quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am so
Enter Input : unhappy! Though it’s such nonsense, it’s a great blow to me. I feel like
Enter Input : Famusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky and she
Enter Input : is Sofya, and, only fancy, I’ve run down to meet you on the stairs, and in
Enter Input : the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I
Enter Input : almost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her
Enter Input : hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother.
Enter Input : I might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still,
Enter Input : what is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, there’s no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her aunts
Enter Input : are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs.
Enter Input : Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn’t know what to do for
Enter Input : him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home in
Enter Input : my carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! It’s true
Enter Input : nothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all that’s holy,
Enter Input : in the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
Enter Input : I’m her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I won’t show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn’t. I am
Enter Input : coming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but now
Enter Input : good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-by to Lise,
Enter Input : the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his
Enter Input : brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting
Enter Input : late, nearly three o’clock. Alyosha’s whole soul turned to the monastery,
Enter Input : to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed
Enter Input : everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about
Enter Input : to happen grew stronger in Alyosha’s mind with every hour. What that
Enter Input : catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he
Enter Input : could perhaps not have said definitely. “Even if my benefactor must die
Enter Input : without me, anyway I won’t have to reproach myself all my life with the
Enter Input : thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and
Enter Input : hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great
Enter Input : precept.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the
Enter Input : fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the
Enter Input : summer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not
Enter Input : announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain
Enter Input : hidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If,
Enter Input : as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be
Enter Input : very likely to come to the summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, give
Enter Input : much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even
Enter Input : if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost
Enter Input : in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-house
Enter Input : unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the house and Foma
Enter Input : too, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and obey his
Enter Input : instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden, or might
Enter Input : warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait.
Enter Input : He looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him as a great deal
Enter Input : more ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, it
Enter Input : seemed a wretched little place this time. There was a circle on the table,
Enter Input : left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before.
Enter Input : Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in
Enter Input : a time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat down
Enter Input : precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat. At last
Enter Input : he felt very depressed—depressed by suspense and uncertainty. But he had
Enter Input : not sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly heard the
Enter Input : thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close. People were sitting, or had only
Enter Input : just sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away.
Enter Input : Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the
Enter Input : day before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among
Enter Input : the bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it
Enter Input : now. Who were they?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A man’s voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying
Enter Input : himself on the guitar:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     With invincible force
Enter Input :     I am bound to my dear.
Enter Input :     O Lord, have mercy
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The voice ceased. It was a lackey’s tenor and a lackey’s song. Another
Enter Input : voice, a woman’s, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though with
Enter Input : mincing affectation:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why haven’t you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why do
Enter Input : you always look down upon us?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all,” answered a man’s voice politely, but with emphatic dignity.
Enter Input : It was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the woman
Enter Input : was making advances. “I believe the man must be Smerdyakov,” thought
Enter Input : Alyosha, “from his voice. And the lady must be the daughter of the house
Enter Input : here, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail
Enter Input : and goes to Marfa for soup.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,” the woman’s
Enter Input : voice continued. “Why don’t you go on?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man sang again:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     What do I care for royal wealth
Enter Input :     If but my dear one be in health?
Enter Input :     Lord have mercy
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input :     On her and on me!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was even better last time,” observed the woman’s voice. “You sang ‘If
Enter Input : my darling be in health’; it sounded more tender. I suppose you’ve
Enter Input : forgotten to-day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Poetry is rubbish!” said Smerdyakov curtly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So far as it’s poetry, it’s essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who
Enter Input : ever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though it
Enter Input : were decreed by government, we shouldn’t say much, should we? Poetry is no
Enter Input : good, Marya Kondratyevna.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How clever you are! How is it you’ve gone so deep into everything?” The
Enter Input : woman’s voice was more and more insinuating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, if
Enter Input : it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have shot a
Enter Input : man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy
Enter Input : beggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my teeth in
Enter Input : Moscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.
Enter Input : Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but I
Enter Input : would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not
Enter Input : have come into the world at all. They used to say in the market, and your
Enter Input : mamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair
Enter Input : was like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a wee
Enter Input : bit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said ‘a little bit,’ like
Enter Input : every one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant’s
Enter Input : feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with an
Enter Input : educated man? He can’t be said to have feeling at all, in his ignorance.
Enter Input : From my childhood up when I hear ‘a wee bit,’ I am ready to burst with
Enter Input : rage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you’d been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn’t have
Enter Input : talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what’s more, I
Enter Input : should like to abolish all soldiers.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia
Enter Input : by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, and
Enter Input : it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A clever nation
Enter Input : would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We should have had
Enter Input : quite different institutions.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldn’t
Enter Input : change a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,” observed Marya
Enter Input : Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a most
Enter Input : languishing glance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s as one prefers.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you are just like a foreigner—just like a most gentlemanly foreigner.
Enter Input : I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in
Enter Input : their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished
Enter Input : boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russian
Enter Input : people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday,
Enter Input : though he is mad, and all his children.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly. He
Enter Input : is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have left
Enter Input : here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his
Enter Input : behavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesn’t know how to do
Enter Input : anything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only a
Enter Input : soup-maker, but with luck I could open a café restaurant in Petrovka, in
Enter Input : Moscow, for my cookery is something special, and there’s no one in Moscow,
Enter Input : except the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special. Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of the first
Enter Input : count in the country, he’d fight him. Though in what way is he better than
Enter Input : I am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has
Enter Input : wasted without any need!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be lovely, a duel,” Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers with
Enter Input : pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady. A
Enter Input : perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I’d give
Enter Input : anything to see one!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is firing
Enter Input : straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You’d be glad to run
Enter Input : away, Marya Kondratyevna.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t mean you would run away?” But Smerdyakov did not deign to
Enter Input : reply. After a moment’s silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sang
Enter Input : again in the same falsetto:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Whatever you may say,
Enter Input :     I shall go far away.
Enter Input :     Life will be bright and gay
Enter Input :     In the city far away.
Enter Input :     I shall not grieve,
Enter Input :     I shall not grieve at all,
Enter Input :     I don’t intend to grieve at all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were
Enter Input : silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakov
Enter Input : dressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhaps
Enter Input : curled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His companion was the daughter
Enter Input : of the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long. She
Enter Input : was young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was so
Enter Input : round and terribly freckled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?” asked Alyosha with as much
Enter Input : composure as he could.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It’s not as if I were his
Enter Input : keeper,” answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I simply asked whether you do know?” Alyosha explained.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know nothing of his whereabouts and don’t want to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the
Enter Input : house, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?”
Enter Input : he asked, looking at Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to the
Enter Input : summer-house. I hope you’ll forgive me,” he added, addressing Marya
Enter Input : Kondratyevna. “I was in a hurry to find my brother.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!” drawled Marya
Enter Input : Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha’s apology. “For Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : often goes to the summer-house in that way. We don’t know he is here and
Enter Input : he is sitting in the summer-house.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now.
Enter Input : Believe me, it’s on business of great importance to him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He never tells us,” lisped Marya Kondratyevna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Though I used to come here as a friend,” Smerdyakov began again, “Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant
Enter Input : questions about the master. ‘What news?’ he’ll ask. ‘What’s going on in
Enter Input : there now? Who’s coming and going?’ and can’t I tell him something more.
Enter Input : Twice already he’s threatened me with death.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With death?” Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you suppose he’d think much of that, with his temper, which you had a
Enter Input : chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let Agrafena
Enter Input : Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I’ll be the first to
Enter Input : suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more
Enter Input : afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what he
Enter Input : might not do!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His honor said to him the other day, ‘I’ll pound you in a mortar!’ ”
Enter Input : added Marya Kondratyevna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, if it’s pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,” observed Alyosha.
Enter Input : “If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,” said Smerdyakov, as though
Enter Input : thinking better of it; “I am here as an old friend and neighbor, and it
Enter Input : would be odd if I didn’t come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent
Enter Input : me first thing this morning to your brother’s lodging in Lake Street,
Enter Input : without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine
Enter Input : with him at the restaurant here, in the market-place. I went, but didn’t
Enter Input : find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o’clock. ‘He’s been
Enter Input : here, but he is quite gone,’ those were the very words of his landlady.
Enter Input : It’s as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this
Enter Input : moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone
Enter Input : an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not
Enter Input : to speak of me and of what I have told you, for he’d kill me for nothing
Enter Input : at all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?” repeated Alyosha
Enter Input : quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The very same.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s quite likely,” cried Alyosha, much excited. “Thank you,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov; that’s important. I’ll go there at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t betray me,” Smerdyakov called after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, I’ll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don’t be anxious.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But wait a minute, I’ll open the gate to you,” cried Marya Kondratyevna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No; it’s a short cut, I’ll get over the fence again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the
Enter Input : tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic
Enter Input : dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them
Enter Input : down. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his
Enter Input : brother Ivan called down to him from it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, can’t you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure I can, only I don’t quite know whether in this dress—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I’ll run down to meet you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone
Enter Input : dining.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Brothers Make Friends
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by
Enter Input : a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was the
Enter Input : first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters were
Enter Input : continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an
Enter Input : old retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual
Enter Input : bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for
Enter Input : the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the
Enter Input : drone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this
Enter Input : tavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he
Enter Input : reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don’t live on tea alone, I
Enter Input : suppose,” cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha.
Enter Input : He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,” said Alyosha gayly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love
Enter Input : cherry jam when you were little?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I
Enter Input : was nearly fifteen. There’s such a difference between fifteen and eleven
Enter Input : that brothers are never companions at those ages. I don’t know whether I
Enter Input : was fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years I
Enter Input : never thought of you at all. Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we
Enter Input : only met once somewhere, I believe. And now I’ve been here more than three
Enter Input : months, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I
Enter Input : am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see you
Enter Input : to say good-by and just then you passed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Were you very anxious to see me, then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me.
Enter Input : And then to say good-by. I believe it’s always best to get to know people
Enter Input : just before leaving them. I’ve noticed how you’ve been looking at me these
Enter Input : three months. There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes,
Enter Input : and I can’t endure that. That’s how it is I’ve kept away from you. But in
Enter Input : the end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I
Enter Input : thought. Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don’t you?
Enter Input : I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if
Enter Input : they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy
Enter Input : me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love
Enter Input : me for some reason, Alyosha?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you—Ivan is a tomb! I say of you,
Enter Input : Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand
Enter Input : something in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s that?” laughed Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t be angry?” Alyosha laughed too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that
Enter Input : you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have I
Enter Input : insulted you dreadfully?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,” cried Ivan, warmly and
Enter Input : good-humoredly. “Would you believe it that ever since that scene with her,
Enter Input : I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as
Enter Input : though you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I’ve been sitting
Enter Input : here thinking to myself: that if I didn’t believe in life, if I lost faith
Enter Input : in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in
Enter Input : fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden
Enter Input : chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man’s disillusionment—still I
Enter Input : should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn
Enter Input : away from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure to
Enter Input : leave the cup, even if I’ve not emptied it, and turn away—where I don’t
Enter Input : know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over
Enter Input : everything—every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I’ve asked
Enter Input : myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would
Enter Input : overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I’ve
Enter Input : come to the conclusion that there isn’t, that is till I am thirty, and
Enter Input : then I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive
Enter Input : moralists—and poets especially—often call that thirst for life base. It’s
Enter Input : a feature of the Karamazovs, it’s true, that thirst for life regardless of
Enter Input : everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal
Enter Input : force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing
Enter Input : for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe
Enter Input : in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they
Enter Input : open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves
Enter Input : you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by
Enter Input : men, though I’ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old
Enter Input : habit one’s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you,
Enter Input : eat it, it will do you good. It’s first-rate soup, they know how to make
Enter Input : it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here.
Enter Input : And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it’s a most
Enter Input : precious graveyard, that’s what it is! Precious are the dead that lie
Enter Input : there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of
Enter Input : such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their
Enter Input : science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and
Enter Input : weep over them; though I’m convinced in my heart that it’s long been
Enter Input : nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply
Enter Input : because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion.
Enter Input : I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky—that’s all it is. It’s
Enter Input : not a matter of intellect or logic, it’s loving with one’s inside, with
Enter Input : one’s stomach. One loves the first strength of one’s youth. Do you
Enter Input : understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?” Ivan laughed suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one’s inside, with
Enter Input : one’s stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have
Enter Input : such a longing for life,” cried Alyosha. “I think every one should love
Enter Input : life above everything in the world.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Love life more than the meaning of it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless
Enter Input : of logic, and it’s only then one will understand the meaning of it. I have
Enter Input : thought so a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan, you love life, now
Enter Input : you’ve only to try to do the second half and you are saved.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does your
Enter Input : second half mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all.
Enter Input : Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such _professions de
Enter Input : foi_ from such—novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it true
Enter Input : that you mean to leave the monastery?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I am
Enter Input : thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesn’t want
Enter Input : to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of hanging on to
Enter Input : eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too seriously, though he is a
Enter Input : buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he stands on his sensuality—though
Enter Input : after we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on.... But
Enter Input : to hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain ‘a
Enter Input : shadow of nobility’ by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, but I saw Smerdyakov,” and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,
Enter Input : described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously and
Enter Input : questioned him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,” added
Enter Input : Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you frowning on Smerdyakov’s account?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but
Enter Input : now there’s no need,” said Ivan reluctantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But are you really going so soon, brother?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?” asked Alyosha anxiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my
Enter Input : brother Dmitri’s keeper?” Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly
Enter Input : smiled bitterly. “Cain’s answer about his murdered brother, wasn’t it?
Enter Input : Perhaps that’s what you’re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I
Enter Input : can’t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I’ve finished what I had to do,
Enter Input : and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I’ve been
Enter Input : trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?
Enter Input : Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished
Enter Input : it just now, you were witness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At Katerina Ivanovna’s?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, and I’ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to
Enter Input : do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn’t come in. I had my own business to settle
Enter Input : with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as
Enter Input : though there was an understanding between us. I didn’t ask him to do it,
Enter Input : but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It’s all
Enter Input : too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would
Enter Input : you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering
Enter Input : champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It’s been going on
Enter Input : nearly six months, and all at once I’ve thrown it off. I could never have
Enter Input : guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I
Enter Input : wanted.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are speaking of your love, Ivan?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried
Enter Input : myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all at
Enter Input : once it’s collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went
Enter Input : away and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it’s the literal
Enter Input : truth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You seem very merry about it now,” observed Alyosha, looking into his
Enter Input : face, which had suddenly grown brighter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But how could I tell that I didn’t care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears
Enter Input : after all I didn’t. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she was
Enter Input : just now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully
Enter Input : even now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, only perhaps it wasn’t love.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha,” laughed Ivan, “don’t make reflections about love, it’s unseemly
Enter Input : for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I’ve forgotten
Enter Input : to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly was sitting
Enter Input : by a ‘laceration.’ Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not
Enter Input : Dmitri,” Ivan insisted gayly. “Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a
Enter Input : self-laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worst
Enter Input : of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she
Enter Input : doesn’t care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she
Enter Input : may never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it’s
Enter Input : better so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What
Enter Input : happened after I departed?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard,
Enter Input : unconscious and delirious.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Isn’t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don’t matter. God
Enter Input : gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won’t go to her at all. Why push
Enter Input : myself forward again?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you told her that she had never cared for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us
Enter Input : drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, brother, we had better not drink,” said Alyosha suddenly. “Besides I
Enter Input : feel somehow depressed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, you’ve been depressed a long time, I’ve noticed it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Morning? I didn’t say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it may
Enter Input : be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid
Enter Input : dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long ago, so
Enter Input : far as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my going away?
Enter Input : We’ve plenty of time before I go, an eternity!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what does it matter to us?” laughed Ivan. “We’ve time enough for our
Enter Input : talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why
Enter Input : have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man
Enter Input : and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the
Enter Input : Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you know what for. It’s different for other people; but we in our
Enter Input : green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. That’s what
Enter Input : we care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternal
Enter Input : questions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practical
Enter Input : questions. Why have you been looking at me in expectation for the last
Enter Input : three months? To ask me, ‘What do you believe, or don’t you believe at
Enter Input : all?’ That’s what your eyes have been meaning for these three months,
Enter Input : haven’t they?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps so,” smiled Alyosha. “You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Me laughing! I don’t want to wound my little brother who has been
Enter Input : watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look straight
Enter Input : at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not a
Enter Input : novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, I
Enter Input : mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit down
Enter Input : in a corner. They’ve never met in their lives before and, when they go out
Enter Input : of the tavern, they won’t meet again for forty years. And what do they
Enter Input : talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions,
Enter Input : of the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe in
Enter Input : God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanity
Enter Input : on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same, they’re the same
Enter Input : questions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most original
Enter Input : Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions! Isn’t it so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, for real Russians the questions of God’s existence and of
Enter Input : immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come
Enter Input : first and foremost, of course, and so they should,” said Alyosha, still
Enter Input : watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, Alyosha, it’s sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but
Enter Input : anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can
Enter Input : hardly imagine. But there’s one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully
Enter Input : fond of.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How nicely you put that in!” Alyosha laughed suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God,
Enter Input : eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father’s that there was
Enter Input : no God.” Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your
Enter Input : eyes glow. But now I’ve no objection to discussing with you, and I say so
Enter Input : very seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have no
Enter Input : friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept God,”
Enter Input : laughed Ivan; “that’s a surprise for you, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Joking? I was told at the elder’s yesterday that I was joking. You know,
Enter Input : dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared
Enter Input : that, if there were no God, he would have to be invented. _S’il n’existait
Enter Input : pas Dieu, il faudrait l’inventer._ And man has actually invented God. And
Enter Input : what’s strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really
Enter Input : exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God,
Enter Input : could enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it
Enter Input : is, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me,
Enter Input : I’ve long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And I
Enter Input : won’t go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject,
Enter Input : all derived from European hypotheses; for what’s a hypothesis there, is an
Enter Input : axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their
Enter Input : teachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys
Enter Input : themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming at
Enter Input : now? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature,
Enter Input : that is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope,
Enter Input : that’s it, isn’t it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply.
Enter Input : But you must note this: if God exists and if He really did create the
Enter Input : world, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of
Enter Input : Euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in
Enter Input : space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,
Enter Input : and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole
Enter Input : universe, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created in
Enter Input : Euclid’s geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which
Enter Input : according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in
Enter Input : infinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can’t understand
Enter Input : even that, I can’t expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly
Enter Input : that I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian
Enter Input : earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world?
Enter Input : And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha,
Enter Input : especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are
Enter Input : utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three
Enter Input : dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what’s more, I accept
Enter Input : His wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the
Enter Input : underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony
Enter Input : in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to
Enter Input : Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was ‘with God,’ and Which
Enter Input : Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of
Enter Input : phrases for it. I seem to be on the right path, don’t I? Yet would you
Enter Input : believe it, in the final result I don’t accept this world of God’s, and,
Enter Input : although I know it exists, I don’t accept it at all. It’s not that I don’t
Enter Input : accept God, you must understand, it’s the world created by Him I don’t and
Enter Input : cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that suffering
Enter Input : will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of
Enter Input : human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the
Enter Input : despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind
Enter Input : of man, that in the world’s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony,
Enter Input : something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all
Enter Input : hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all
Enter Input : the crimes of humanity, of all the blood they’ve shed; that it will make
Enter Input : it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with
Enter Input : men—but though all that may come to pass, I don’t accept it. I won’t
Enter Input : accept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see
Enter Input : it and say that they’ve met, but still I won’t accept it. That’s what’s at
Enter Input : the root of me, Alyosha; that’s my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I
Enter Input : began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I’ve led up to my
Enter Input : confession, for that’s all you want. You didn’t want to hear about God,
Enter Input : but only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I’ve told
Enter Input : you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And why did you begin ‘as stupidly as you could’?” asked Alyosha, looking
Enter Input : dreamily at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on
Enter Input : such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And secondly,
Enter Input : the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is,
Enter Input : the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence
Enter Input : wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is
Enter Input : honest and straightforward. I’ve led the conversation to my despair, and
Enter Input : the more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You will explain why you don’t accept the world?” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure I will, it’s not a secret, that’s what I’ve been leading up
Enter Input : to. Dear little brother, I don’t want to corrupt you or to turn you from
Enter Input : your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.” Ivan smiled suddenly
Enter Input : quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile on
Enter Input : his face before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. Rebellion
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must make you one confession,” Ivan began. “I could never understand
Enter Input : how one can love one’s neighbors. It’s just one’s neighbors, to my mind,
Enter Input : that one can’t love, though one might love those at a distance. I once
Enter Input : read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen
Enter Input : beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and
Enter Input : began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some
Enter Input : awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from ‘self-laceration,’
Enter Input : from the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed
Enter Input : by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must be
Enter Input : hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,” observed Alyosha; “he,
Enter Input : too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced
Enter Input : in love, from loving him. But yet there’s a great deal of love in mankind,
Enter Input : and almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can’t understand it, and the
Enter Input : innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether
Enter Input : that’s due to men’s bad qualities or whether it’s inherent in their
Enter Input : nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible
Enter Input : on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer
Enter Input : intensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is another
Enter Input : and not I. And what’s more, a man is rarely ready to admit another’s
Enter Input : suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won’t he admit it, do you
Enter Input : think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I
Enter Input : once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering;
Enter Input : degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me—hunger, for
Enter Input : instance—my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher
Enter Input : suffering—for an idea, for instance—he will very rarely admit that,
Enter Input : perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man
Enter Input : should have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of
Enter Input : his favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially
Enter Input : genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity
Enter Input : through the newspapers. One can love one’s neighbors in the abstract, or
Enter Input : even at a distance, but at close quarters it’s almost impossible. If it
Enter Input : were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear
Enter Input : silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then
Enter Input : one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But
Enter Input : enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to
Enter Input : speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine
Enter Input : ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my
Enter Input : argument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we’d better keep to the
Enter Input : children, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children
Enter Input : can be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when
Enter Input : they are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second
Enter Input : reason why I won’t speak of grown-up people is that, besides being
Enter Input : disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation—they’ve eaten
Enter Input : the apple and know good and evil, and they have become ‘like gods.’ They
Enter Input : go on eating it still. But the children haven’t eaten anything, and are so
Enter Input : far innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you
Enter Input : will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer
Enter Input : horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers’ sins, they must be
Enter Input : punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning
Enter Input : is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on
Enter Input : earth. The innocent must not suffer for another’s sins, and especially
Enter Input : such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond
Enter Input : of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious,
Enter Input : the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they
Enter Input : are quite little—up to seven, for instance—are so remote from grown-up
Enter Input : people; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.
Enter Input : I knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a
Enter Input : burglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when he
Enter Input : was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time
Enter Input : at his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He
Enter Input : trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends
Enter Input : with him.... You don’t know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My
Enter Input : head aches and I am sad.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You speak with a strange air,” observed Alyosha uneasily, “as though you
Enter Input : were not quite yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,” Ivan went on, seeming
Enter Input : not to hear his brother’s words, “told me about the crimes committed by
Enter Input : Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general
Enter Input : rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and
Enter Input : children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them
Enter Input : so till morning, and in the morning they hang them—all sorts of things you
Enter Input : can’t imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that’s a
Enter Input : great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as
Enter Input : a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that’s all
Enter Input : he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he
Enter Input : were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children,
Enter Input : too; cutting the unborn child from the mother’s womb, and tossing babies
Enter Input : up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before
Enter Input : their mothers’ eyes. Doing it before the mothers’ eyes was what gave zest
Enter Input : to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.
Enter Input : Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading
Enter Input : Turks around her. They’ve planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to
Enter Input : make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points
Enter Input : a pistol four inches from the baby’s face. The baby laughs with glee,
Enter Input : holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the
Enter Input : baby’s face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn’t it? By the way,
Enter Input : Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, what are you driving at?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think if the devil doesn’t exist, but man has created him, he has
Enter Input : created him in his own image and likeness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just as he did God, then?” observed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘It’s wonderful how you can turn words,’ as Polonius says in _Hamlet_,”
Enter Input : laughed Ivan. “You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours must
Enter Input : be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and likeness. You asked
Enter Input : just now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond of collecting certain
Enter Input : facts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort
Enter Input : from newspapers and books, and I’ve already got a fine collection. The
Enter Input : Turks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have
Enter Input : specimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we
Enter Input : prefer beating—rods and scourges—that’s our national institution. Nailing
Enter Input : ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod
Enter Input : and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us.
Enter Input : Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws
Enter Input : have been passed, so that they don’t dare to flog men now. But they make
Enter Input : up for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that it
Enter Input : would be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being
Enter Input : inoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.
Enter Input : I have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,
Enter Input : quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed—a young
Enter Input : man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the
Enter Input : Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimate
Enter Input : child who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on
Enter Input : the Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up like
Enter Input : a little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and
Enter Input : scarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock
Enter Input : in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite
Enter Input : the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been
Enter Input : given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of
Enter Input : feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like the
Enter Input : Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to the
Enter Input : pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn’t even give him that,
Enter Input : and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent all
Enter Input : his childhood and his youth, till he grew up and was strong enough to go
Enter Input : away and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day laborer
Enter Input : in Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by
Enter Input : killing and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to
Enter Input : death. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was
Enter Input : immediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods,
Enter Input : philanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in
Enter Input : prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon
Enter Input : him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his
Enter Input : crime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a
Enter Input : monster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace.
Enter Input : All Geneva was in excitement about him—all philanthropic and religious
Enter Input : Geneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to
Enter Input : the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; ‘You are our brother, you
Enter Input : have found grace.’ And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, ‘Yes,
Enter Input : I’ve found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs’ food, but
Enter Input : now even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.’ ‘Yes, Richard, die
Enter Input : in the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though it’s not your fault
Enter Input : that you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs’ food and were
Enter Input : beaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing is
Enter Input : forbidden); but you’ve shed blood and you must die.’ And on the last day,
Enter Input : Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute:
Enter Input : ‘This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.’ ‘Yes,’ cry the pastors
Enter Input : and the judges and philanthropic ladies. ‘This is the happiest day of your
Enter Input : life, for you are going to the Lord!’ They all walk or drive to the
Enter Input : scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call to
Enter Input : Richard: ‘Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!’
Enter Input : And so, covered with his brothers’ kisses, Richard is dragged on to the
Enter Input : scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head in
Enter Input : brotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, that’s characteristic.
Enter Input : That pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists
Enter Input : of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed
Enter Input : gratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is
Enter Input : interesting because it’s national. Though to us it’s absurd to cut off a
Enter Input : man’s head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet we
Enter Input : have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical pastime is
Enter Input : the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov
Enter Input : describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, ‘on its meek eyes,’
Enter Input : every one must have seen it. It’s peculiarly Russian. He describes how a
Enter Input : feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move.
Enter Input : The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what
Enter Input : he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over
Enter Input : and over again. ‘However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.’
Enter Input : The nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature
Enter Input : on its weeping, on its ‘meek eyes.’ The frantic beast tugs and draws the
Enter Input : load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort
Enter Input : of unnatural spasmodic action—it’s awful in Nekrassov. But that’s only a
Enter Input : horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught
Enter Input : us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can
Enter Input : be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own
Enter Input : child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it.
Enter Input : The papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. ‘It stings more,’
Enter Input : said he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there
Enter Input : are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal
Enter Input : sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. They
Enter Input : beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more
Enter Input : savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps,
Enter Input : ‘Daddy! daddy!’ By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought
Enter Input : into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a
Enter Input : barrister ‘a conscience for hire.’ The counsel protests in his client’s
Enter Input : defense. ‘It’s such a simple thing,’ he says, ‘an everyday domestic event.
Enter Input : A father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought into
Enter Input : court.’ The jury, convinced by him, give a favorable verdict. The public
Enter Input : roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn’t
Enter Input : there! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor!
Enter Input : Charming pictures.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I’ve still better things about children. I’ve collected a great,
Enter Input : great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of
Enter Input : five who was hated by her father and mother, ‘most worthy and respectable
Enter Input : people, of good education and breeding.’ You see, I must repeat again, it
Enter Input : is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing
Enter Input : children, and children only. To all other types of humanity these
Enter Input : torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane
Enter Input : Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of
Enter Input : children themselves in that sense. It’s just their defenselessness that
Enter Input : tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no
Enter Input : refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of
Enter Input : course, a demon lies hidden—the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat
Enter Input : at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off
Enter Input : the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney
Enter Input : disease, and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those
Enter Input : cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason
Enter Input : till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of
Enter Input : cruelty—shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and
Enter Input : because she didn’t ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five
Enter Input : sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they
Enter Input : smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her
Enter Input : mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor
Enter Input : child’s groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can’t even
Enter Input : understand what’s done to her, should beat her little aching heart with
Enter Input : her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful
Enter Input : tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and
Enter Input : brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy
Enter Input : must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have
Enter Input : existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he
Enter Input : know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole
Enter Input : world of knowledge is not worth that child’s prayer to ‘dear, kind God’! I
Enter Input : say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the
Enter Input : apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am
Enter Input : making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I’ll leave off if you
Enter Input : like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind. I want to suffer too,” muttered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One picture, only one more, because it’s so curious, so characteristic,
Enter Input : and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities.
Enter Input : I’ve forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was in the darkest days of
Enter Input : serfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of
Enter Input : the People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections,
Enter Input : the owner of great estates, one of those men—somewhat exceptional, I
Enter Input : believe, even then—who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure,
Enter Input : are convinced that they’ve earned absolute power over the lives of their
Enter Input : subjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his
Enter Input : property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor
Enter Input : neighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of
Enter Input : hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys—all mounted, and in
Enter Input : uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in
Enter Input : play and hurt the paw of the general’s favorite hound. ‘Why is my favorite
Enter Input : dog lame?’ He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog’s paw.
Enter Input : ‘So you did it.’ The general looked the child up and down. ‘Take him.’ He
Enter Input : was taken—taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that
Enter Input : morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his
Enter Input : dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting
Enter Input : parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of
Enter Input : them all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from the
Enter Input : lock-up. It’s a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting.
Enter Input : The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked.
Enter Input : He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... ‘Make him run,’
Enter Input : commands the general. ‘Run! run!’ shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... ‘At
Enter Input : him!’ yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the
Enter Input : child. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother’s
Enter Input : eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of
Enter Input : administering his estates. Well—what did he deserve? To be shot? To be
Enter Input : shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be shot,” murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale,
Enter Input : twisted smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo!” cried Ivan, delighted. “If even you say so.... You’re a pretty
Enter Input : monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha
Enter Input : Karamazov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What I said was absurd, but—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just the point, that ‘but’!” cried Ivan. “Let me tell you, novice,
Enter Input : that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on
Enter Input : absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without
Enter Input : them. We know what we know!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you know?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand nothing,” Ivan went on, as though in delirium. “I don’t want
Enter Input : to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind
Enter Input : long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be
Enter Input : false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you trying me?” Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. “Will you
Enter Input : say what you mean at last?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course, I will; that’s what I’ve been leading up to. You are dear to
Enter Input : me, I don’t want to let you go, and I won’t give you up to your Zossima.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of the
Enter Input : other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to
Enter Input : its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. I
Enter Input : am a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why the
Enter Input : world is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they
Enter Input : were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven,
Enter Input : though they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity
Enter Input : them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is
Enter Input : that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows
Enter Input : effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level—but
Enter Input : that’s only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can’t consent to live
Enter Input : by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause
Enter Input : follows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?—I must have
Enter Input : justice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite
Enter Input : time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have
Enter Input : believed in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise
Enter Input : again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I
Enter Input : haven’t suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure
Enter Input : the soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my
Enter Input : own eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and
Enter Input : embrace his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly
Enter Input : understands what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are
Enter Input : built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the
Enter Input : children, and what am I to do about them? That’s a question I can’t
Enter Input : answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions,
Enter Input : but I’ve only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so
Enter Input : unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal
Enter Input : harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It’s beyond
Enter Input : all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the
Enter Input : harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the
Enter Input : harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. I
Enter Input : understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such
Enter Input : solidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must share
Enter Input : responsibility for all their fathers’ crimes, such a truth is not of this
Enter Input : world and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that
Enter Input : the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn’t grow
Enter Input : up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I
Enter Input : am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the
Enter Input : universe it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in one
Enter Input : hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: ‘Thou
Enter Input : art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.’ When the mother embraces the
Enter Input : fiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears,
Enter Input : ‘Thou art just, O Lord!’ then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be
Enter Input : reached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I
Enter Input : can’t accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take
Enter Input : my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I
Enter Input : live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry
Enter Input : aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child’s torturer,
Enter Input : ‘Thou art just, O Lord!’ but I don’t want to cry aloud then. While there
Enter Input : is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher
Enter Input : harmony altogether. It’s not worth the tears of that one tortured child
Enter Input : who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its
Enter Input : stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to ‘dear, kind God’! It’s not
Enter Input : worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for,
Enter Input : or there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them?
Enter Input : Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging
Enter Input : them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do,
Enter Input : since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of
Enter Input : harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don’t
Enter Input : want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum
Enter Input : of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that
Enter Input : the truth is not worth such a price. I don’t want the mother to embrace
Enter Input : the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let
Enter Input : her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for
Enter Input : the immeasurable suffering of her mother’s heart. But the sufferings of
Enter Input : her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the
Enter Input : torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if
Enter Input : they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole
Enter Input : world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I
Enter Input : don’t want harmony. From love for humanity I don’t want it. I would rather
Enter Input : be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my
Enter Input : unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_.
Enter Input : Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means to
Enter Input : pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance
Enter Input : ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as
Enter Input : possible. And that I am doing. It’s not God that I don’t accept, Alyosha,
Enter Input : only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s rebellion,” murmured Alyosha, looking down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,” said Ivan earnestly. “One can
Enter Input : hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I
Enter Input : challenge you—answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human
Enter Input : destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace
Enter Input : and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to
Enter Input : death only one tiny creature—that baby beating its breast with its fist,
Enter Input : for instance—and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you
Enter Input : consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the
Enter Input : truth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I wouldn’t consent,” said Alyosha softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would
Enter Input : agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood
Enter Input : of a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I can’t admit it. Brother,” said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing
Enter Input : eyes, “you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would
Enter Input : have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and He
Enter Input : can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent
Enter Input : blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built
Enter Input : the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, ‘Thou art just, O Lord, for
Enter Input : Thy ways are revealed!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; on
Enter Input : the contrary I’ve been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring
Enter Input : Him in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in the
Enter Input : foreground. Do you know, Alyosha—don’t laugh! I made a poem about a year
Enter Input : ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I’ll tell it to you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You wrote a poem?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, I didn’t write it,” laughed Ivan, “and I’ve never written two
Enter Input : lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I
Enter Input : remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first
Enter Input : reader—that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?”
Enter Input : smiled Ivan. “Shall I tell it to you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am all attention,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My poem is called ‘The Grand Inquisitor’; it’s a ridiculous thing, but I
Enter Input : want to tell it to you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Even this must have a preface—that is, a literary preface,” laughed Ivan,
Enter Input : “and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the
Enter Input : sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it
Enter Input : was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to
Enter Input : speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the
Enter Input : monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the
Enter Input : saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In
Enter Input : those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo’s _Notre Dame de
Enter Input : Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in
Enter Input : the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the
Enter Input : birth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la très sainte et
Enter Input : gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and
Enter Input : pronounces her _bon jugement_. Similar plays, chiefly from the Old
Enter Input : Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of
Enter Input : Peter the Great. But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and
Enter Input : ballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all
Enter Input : the powers of Heaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monks
Enter Input : busied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such
Enter Input : poems—and even under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of
Enter Input : course, from the Greek), _The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell_, with
Enter Input : descriptions as bold as Dante’s. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel
Enter Input : Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners and their
Enter Input : punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a
Enter Input : burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they
Enter Input : can’t swim out, and ‘these God forgets’—an expression of extraordinary
Enter Input : depth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the
Enter Input : throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell—for all she has seen
Enter Input : there, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immensely
Enter Input : interesting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God points
Enter Input : to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, ‘How can
Enter Input : I forgive His tormentors?’ she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all
Enter Input : the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all
Enter Input : without distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite of
Enter Input : suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at
Enter Input : once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, ‘Thou art just, O
Enter Input : Lord, in this judgment.’ Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it
Enter Input : had appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He says
Enter Input : nothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since
Enter Input : He promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet
Enter Input : wrote, ‘Behold, I come quickly’; ‘Of that day and that hour knoweth no
Enter Input : man, neither the Son, but the Father,’ as He Himself predicted on earth.
Enter Input : But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh,
Enter Input : with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to
Enter Input : see signs from heaven.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     No signs from heaven come to-day
Enter Input :     To add to what the heart doth say.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true
Enter Input : there were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed
Enter Input : miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were
Enter Input : visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, and
Enter Input : doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And
Enter Input : just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. “A
Enter Input : huge star like to a torch” (that is, to a church) “fell on the sources of
Enter Input : the waters and they became bitter.” These heretics began blasphemously
Enter Input : denying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent
Enter Input : in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before, awaited
Enter Input : His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him as
Enter Input : before. And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor, “O Lord
Enter Input : our God, hasten Thy coming,” so many ages called upon Him, that in His
Enter Input : infinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He
Enter Input : had come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as is
Enter Input : written in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the
Enter Input : truth of his words, bore witness that
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,
Enter Input :     Weary and worn, the Heavenly King
Enter Input :     Our mother, Russia, came to bless,
Enter Input :     And through our land went wandering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And that certainly was so, I assure you.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the
Enter Input : tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him like
Enter Input : children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible time
Enter Input : of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God,
Enter Input : and ‘in the splendid _auto da fé_ the wicked heretics were burnt.’ Oh, of
Enter Input : course, this was not the coming in which He will appear according to His
Enter Input : promise at the end of time in all His heavenly glory, and which will be
Enter Input : sudden ‘as lightning flashing from east to west.’ No, He visited His
Enter Input : children only for a moment, and there where the flames were crackling
Enter Input : round the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in
Enter Input : that human shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen
Enter Input : centuries ago. He came down to the ‘hot pavements’ of the southern town in
Enter Input : which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, _ad majorem gloriam
Enter Input : Dei_, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent
Enter Input : _auto da fé_, in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, the
Enter Input : cardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole population
Enter Input : of Seville.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognized
Enter Input : Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they
Enter Input : recognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround
Enter Input : Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst
Enter Input : with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His
Enter Input : heart, light and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on
Enter Input : the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His
Enter Input : hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with
Enter Input : Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from
Enter Input : childhood, cries out, ‘O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!’ and, as it
Enter Input : were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd
Enter Input : weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before
Enter Input : Him, sing, and cry hosannah. ‘It is He—it is He!’ all repeat. ‘It must be
Enter Input : He, it can be no one but Him!’ He stops at the steps of the Seville
Enter Input : cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little
Enter Input : open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a
Enter Input : prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. ‘He will raise
Enter Input : your child,’ the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to
Enter Input : meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead
Enter Input : child throws herself at His feet with a wail. ‘If it is Thou, raise my
Enter Input : child!’ she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the
Enter Input : coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His
Enter Input : lips once more softly pronounce, ‘Maiden, arise!’ and the maiden arises.
Enter Input : The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with
Enter Input : wide-open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in
Enter Input : her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the
Enter Input : cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an
Enter Input : old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken
Enter Input : eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his
Enter Input : gorgeous cardinal’s robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning
Enter Input : the enemies of the Roman Church—at this moment he is wearing his coarse,
Enter Input : old, monk’s cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants
Enter Input : and slaves and the ‘holy guard.’ He stops at the sight of the crowd and
Enter Input : watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the
Enter Input : coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He
Enter Input : knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He
Enter Input : holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power,
Enter Input : so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience
Enter Input : to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the
Enter Input : midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The
Enter Input : crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old
Enter Input : Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards
Enter Input : lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient
Enter Input : palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is
Enter Input : followed by the dark, burning, ‘breathless’ night of Seville. The air is
Enter Input : ‘fragrant with laurel and lemon.’ In the pitch darkness the iron door of
Enter Input : the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in
Enter Input : with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind
Enter Input : him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face.
Enter Input : At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Is it Thou? Thou?’ but receiving no answer, he adds at once, ‘Don’t
Enter Input : answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou
Enter Input : wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst
Enter Input : said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to
Enter Input : hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be
Enter Input : to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou
Enter Input : or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn
Enter Input : Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have
Enter Input : to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush
Enter Input : to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou
Enter Input : knowest it,’ he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment
Enter Input : taking his eyes off the Prisoner.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?” Alyosha, who had been
Enter Input : listening in silence, said with a smile. “Is it simply a wild fantasy, or
Enter Input : a mistake on the part of the old man—some impossible _quiproquo_?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Take it as the last,” said Ivan, laughing, “if you are so corrupted by
Enter Input : modern realism and can’t stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be a
Enter Input : case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,” he went on,
Enter Input : laughing, “the old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his set
Enter Input : idea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. It
Enter Input : might, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man of
Enter Input : ninety, over-excited by the _auto da fé_ of a hundred heretics the day
Enter Input : before. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of
Enter Input : identity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should
Enter Input : speak out, should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for
Enter Input : ninety years.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a word?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s inevitable in any case,” Ivan laughed again. “The old man has told
Enter Input : Him He hasn’t the right to add anything to what He has said of old. One
Enter Input : may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my
Enter Input : opinion at least. ‘All has been given by Thee to the Pope,’ they say, ‘and
Enter Input : all, therefore, is still in the Pope’s hands, and there is no need for
Enter Input : Thee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.’
Enter Input : That’s how they speak and write too—the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read
Enter Input : it myself in the works of their theologians. ‘Hast Thou the right to
Enter Input : reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast
Enter Input : come?’ my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. ‘No, Thou
Enter Input : hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, and
Enter Input : mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast
Enter Input : on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men’s freedom of
Enter Input : faith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of their
Enter Input : faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years
Enter Input : ago. Didst Thou not often say then, “I will make you free”? But now Thou
Enter Input : hast seen these “free” men,’ the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive
Enter Input : smile. ‘Yes, we’ve paid dearly for it,’ he goes on, looking sternly at
Enter Input : Him, ‘but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen
Enter Input : centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and
Enter Input : over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it’s over for good? Thou lookest
Enter Input : meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tell
Enter Input : Thee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have
Enter Input : perfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it
Enter Input : humbly at our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst?
Enter Input : Was this Thy freedom?’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t understand again,” Alyosha broke in. “Is he ironical, is he
Enter Input : jesting?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that
Enter Input : at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy.
Enter Input : ‘For now’ (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) ‘for the first
Enter Input : time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men. Man was
Enter Input : created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,’ he says
Enter Input : to Him. ‘Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst
Enter Input : not listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men
Enter Input : might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the
Enter Input : work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thou
Enter Input : hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thou
Enter Input : canst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder
Enter Input : us?’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what’s the meaning of ‘no lack of admonitions and warnings’?” asked
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, that’s the chief part of what the old man must say.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and
Enter Input : non-existence,’ the old man goes on, ‘the great spirit talked with Thee in
Enter Input : the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he “tempted” Thee. Is
Enter Input : that so? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in
Enter Input : three questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is
Enter Input : called “the temptation”? And yet if there has ever been on earth a real
Enter Input : stupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three
Enter Input : temptations. The statement of those three questions was itself the
Enter Input : miracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument
Enter Input : that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from
Enter Input : the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to
Enter Input : do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth—rulers, chief
Enter Input : priests, learned men, philosophers, poets—and had set them the task to
Enter Input : invent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but
Enter Input : express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history of
Enter Input : the world and of humanity—dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of the
Enter Input : earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the
Enter Input : three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and
Enter Input : mighty spirit in the wilderness? From those questions alone, from the
Enter Input : miracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not with
Enter Input : the fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For in
Enter Input : those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it
Enter Input : were, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them are
Enter Input : united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature. At the
Enter Input : time it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that
Enter Input : fifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three
Enter Input : questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly
Enter Input : fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Judge Thyself who was right—Thou or he who questioned Thee then?
Enter Input : Remember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this: “Thou
Enter Input : wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with some
Enter Input : promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural
Enter Input : unruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread—for nothing
Enter Input : has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than
Enter Input : freedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren
Enter Input : wilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a
Enter Input : flock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest
Enter Input : Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.” But Thou wouldst not
Enter Input : deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that
Enter Input : freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply that
Enter Input : man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of that
Enter Input : earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will
Enter Input : strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him, crying, “Who
Enter Input : can compare with this beast? He has given us fire from heaven!” Dost Thou
Enter Input : know that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of
Enter Input : their sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only
Enter Input : hunger? “Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!” that’s what they’ll write
Enter Input : on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which they
Enter Input : will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building;
Enter Input : the terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the one
Enter Input : of old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new
Enter Input : tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for
Enter Input : they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their
Enter Input : tower. They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for
Enter Input : we shall be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to
Enter Input : us, “Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven’t
Enter Input : given it!” And then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishes
Enter Input : the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name,
Enter Input : declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they feed
Enter Input : themselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as they
Enter Input : remain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say
Enter Input : to us, “Make us your slaves, but feed us.” They will understand
Enter Input : themselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are
Enter Input : inconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share
Enter Input : between them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free,
Enter Input : for they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. Thou didst promise
Enter Input : them the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly
Enter Input : bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if
Enter Input : for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is
Enter Input : to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures
Enter Input : who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of
Enter Input : the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the
Enter Input : great and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea,
Enter Input : who are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and
Enter Input : strong? No, we care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but
Enter Input : in the end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and look
Enter Input : on us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have
Enter Input : found so dreadful and to rule over them—so awful it will seem to them to
Enter Input : be free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in
Enter Input : Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us
Enter Input : again. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to
Enter Input : lie.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, and
Enter Input : this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou
Enter Input : hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the great
Enter Input : secret of this world. Choosing “bread,” Thou wouldst have satisfied the
Enter Input : universal and everlasting craving of humanity—to find some one to worship.
Enter Input : So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so
Enter Input : painfully as to find some one to worship. But man seeks to worship what is
Enter Input : established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship
Enter Input : it. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or
Enter Input : the other can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and
Enter Input : worship; what is essential is that all may be _together_ in it. This
Enter Input : craving for _community_ of worship is the chief misery of every man
Enter Input : individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake
Enter Input : of common worship they’ve slain each other with the sword. They have set
Enter Input : up gods and challenged one another, “Put away your gods and come and
Enter Input : worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!” And so it will be to the
Enter Input : end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall
Enter Input : down before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but
Enter Input : have known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject
Enter Input : the one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down
Enter Input : to Thee alone—the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for
Enter Input : the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didst
Enter Input : further. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man is
Enter Input : tormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom he
Enter Input : can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is
Enter Input : born. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their
Enter Input : freedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread,
Enter Input : and man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if
Enter Input : some one else gains possession of his conscience—oh! then he will cast
Enter Input : away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience. In
Enter Input : that Thou wast right. For the secret of man’s being is not only to live
Enter Input : but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the
Enter Input : object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather
Enter Input : destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.
Enter Input : That is true. But what happened? Instead of taking men’s freedom from
Enter Input : them, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man
Enter Input : prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of
Enter Input : good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of
Enter Input : conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,
Enter Input : instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at
Enter Input : rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and
Enter Input : enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men,
Enter Input : acting as though Thou didst not love them at all—Thou who didst come to
Enter Input : give Thy life for them! Instead of taking possession of men’s freedom,
Enter Input : Thou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with
Enter Input : its sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man’s free love, that he should
Enter Input : follow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the
Enter Input : rigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself
Enter Input : what is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his
Enter Input : guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even Thy image
Enter Input : and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free
Enter Input : choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, for
Enter Input : they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou
Enter Input : hast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the
Enter Input : destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet what
Enter Input : was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone, able to
Enter Input : conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent
Enter Input : rebels for their happiness—those forces are miracle, mystery and
Enter Input : authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing
Enter Input : so. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple
Enter Input : and said to Thee, “If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God
Enter Input : then cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up
Enter Input : lest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art
Enter Input : the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father.”
Enter Input : But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down. Oh, of course,
Enter Input : Thou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men,
Enter Input : are they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in making
Enter Input : one movement to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have
Enter Input : lost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against
Enter Input : that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise spirit that tempted
Enter Input : Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And
Enter Input : couldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such a
Enter Input : temptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and
Enter Input : at the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most
Enter Input : agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the
Enter Input : heart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, would
Enter Input : be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thou
Enter Input : didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a
Enter Input : miracle. But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects
Enter Input : God too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And as man
Enter Input : cannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new miracles of
Enter Input : his own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft,
Enter Input : though he might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou
Enter Input : didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and
Enter Input : reviling Thee, “Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art
Enter Input : He.” Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a
Enter Input : miracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. Thou
Enter Input : didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before
Enter Input : the might that has overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly
Enter Input : of men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by
Enter Input : nature. Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon
Enter Input : them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and
Enter Input : baser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he, can he do what Thou
Enter Input : didst? By showing him so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to
Enter Input : feel for him, for Thou didst ask far too much from him—Thou who hast loved
Enter Input : him more than Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less
Enter Input : of him. That would have been more like love, for his burden would have
Enter Input : been lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
Enter Input : rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the pride
Enter Input : of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and barring
Enter Input : out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will end; it will
Enter Input : cost them dear. They will cast down temples and drench the earth with
Enter Input : blood. But they will see at last, the foolish children, that, though they
Enter Input : are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their own
Enter Input : rebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears, they will recognize at last that
Enter Input : He who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them. They will say
Enter Input : this in despair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make
Enter Input : them more unhappy still, for man’s nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in
Enter Input : the end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and
Enter Input : unhappiness—that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so much
Enter Input : for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in image, that he
Enter Input : saw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there were
Enter Input : of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there were so many of them, they
Enter Input : must have been not men but gods. They had borne Thy cross, they had
Enter Input : endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living upon
Enter Input : locusts and roots—and Thou mayest indeed point with pride at those
Enter Input : children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy
Enter Input : name. But remember that they were only some thousands; and what of the
Enter Input : rest? And how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not
Enter Input : endure what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that it
Enter Input : is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply come to
Enter Input : the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and we cannot
Enter Input : understand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right to preach a
Enter Input : mystery, and to teach them that it’s not the free judgment of their
Enter Input : hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which they must follow
Enter Input : blindly, even against their conscience. So we have done. We have corrected
Enter Input : Thy work and have founded it upon _miracle_, _mystery_ and _authority_.
Enter Input : And men rejoiced that they were again led like sheep, and that the
Enter Input : terrible gift that had brought them such suffering was, at last, lifted
Enter Input : from their hearts. Were we right teaching them this? Speak! Did we not
Enter Input : love mankind, so meekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly
Enter Input : lightening their burden, and permitting their weak nature even sin with
Enter Input : our sanction? Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look
Enter Input : silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I don’t want
Enter Input : Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anything
Enter Input : from Thee? Don’t I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is known
Enter Input : to Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our mystery?
Enter Input : Perhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not
Enter Input : working with Thee, but with _him_—that is our mystery. It’s long—eight
Enter Input : centuries—since we have been on _his_ side and not on Thine. Just eight
Enter Input : centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that
Enter Input : last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We
Enter Input : took from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and proclaimed ourselves sole
Enter Input : rulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been able to complete our
Enter Input : work. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has
Enter Input : begun. It has long to await completion and the earth has yet much to
Enter Input : suffer, but we shall triumph and shall be Cæsars, and then we shall plan
Enter Input : the universal happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then the
Enter Input : sword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst Thou accepted
Enter Input : that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished all
Enter Input : that man seeks on earth—that is, some one to worship, some one to keep his
Enter Input : conscience, and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious
Enter Input : ant-heap, for the craving for universal unity is the third and last
Enter Input : anguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a
Enter Input : universal state. There have been many great nations with great histories,
Enter Input : but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for
Enter Input : they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union.
Enter Input : The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes
Enter Input : over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they too
Enter Input : were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal
Enter Input : unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and Cæsar’s purple, Thou wouldst have
Enter Input : founded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who can
Enter Input : rule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his
Enter Input : hands? We have taken the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course, have
Enter Input : rejected Thee and followed _him_. Oh, ages are yet to come of the
Enter Input : confusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having
Enter Input : begun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,
Enter Input : with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet
Enter Input : and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon the beast and
Enter Input : raise the cup, and on it will be written, “Mystery.” But then, and only
Enter Input : then, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men. Thou art proud
Enter Input : of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we give rest to all.
Enter Input : And besides, how many of those elect, those mighty ones who could become
Enter Input : elect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will
Enter Input : transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the
Enter Input : other camp, and end by raising their _free_ banner against Thee. Thou
Enter Input : didst Thyself lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will
Enter Input : no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shall
Enter Input : persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their
Enter Input : freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right or shall we be
Enter Input : lying? They will be convinced that we are right, for they will remember
Enter Input : the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.
Enter Input : Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and
Enter Input : will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries,
Enter Input : that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves,
Enter Input : others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest,
Enter Input : weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes,
Enter Input : you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you,
Enter Input : save us from ourselves!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread
Enter Input : made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any miracle.
Enter Input : They will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but in truth they
Enter Input : will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread
Enter Input : itself! For they will remember only too well that in old days, without our
Enter Input : help, even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands, while
Enter Input : since they have come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in
Enter Input : their hands. Too, too well will they know the value of complete
Enter Input : submission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to
Enter Input : blame for their not knowing it?—speak! Who scattered the flock and sent it
Enter Input : astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come together again and will
Enter Input : submit once more, and then it will be once for all. Then we shall give
Enter Input : them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by
Enter Input : nature. Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst
Enter Input : lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that
Enter Input : they are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike
Enter Input : happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look to
Enter Input : us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvel
Enter Input : at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our being
Enter Input : so powerful and clever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent
Enter Input : flock of thousands of millions. They will tremble impotently before our
Enter Input : wrath, their minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tears
Enter Input : like women and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from us
Enter Input : to pass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes,
Enter Input : we shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their
Enter Input : life like a child’s game, with children’s songs and innocent dance. Oh, we
Enter Input : shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love
Enter Input : us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall tell them that
Enter Input : every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that we
Enter Input : allow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these sins
Enter Input : we take upon ourselves. And we shall take it upon ourselves, and they will
Enter Input : adore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins before
Enter Input : God. And they will have no secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them
Enter Input : to live with their wives and mistresses, to have or not to have
Enter Input : children—according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient—and
Enter Input : they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of
Enter Input : their conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an
Enter Input : answer for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will
Enter Input : save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present
Enter Input : in making a free decision for themselves. And all will be happy, all the
Enter Input : millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For
Enter Input : only we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will be
Enter Input : thousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who
Enter Input : have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.
Enter Input : Peacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and
Enter Input : beyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the
Enter Input : secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of
Enter Input : heaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world, it
Enter Input : certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that Thou wilt
Enter Input : come again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud and
Enter Input : strong, but we will say that they have only saved themselves, but we have
Enter Input : saved all. We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds
Enter Input : in her hands the _mystery_, shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise
Enter Input : up again, and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her
Enter Input : loathsome body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the
Enter Input : thousand millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we who have
Enter Input : taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and
Enter Input : say: “Judge us if Thou canst and darest.” Know that I fear Thee not. Know
Enter Input : that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on roots and
Enter Input : locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and I
Enter Input : too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful,
Enter Input : thirsting “to make up the number.” But I awakened and would not serve
Enter Input : madness. I turned back and joined the ranks of those _who have corrected
Enter Input : Thy work_. I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness
Enter Input : of the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will
Enter Input : be built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at
Enter Input : a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on
Enter Input : which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if any one has ever
Enter Input : deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn Thee. _Dixi._’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with excitement;
Enter Input : when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved and
Enter Input : seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained himself.
Enter Input : Now his words came with a rush.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But ... that’s absurd!” he cried, flushing. “Your poem is in praise of
Enter Input : Jesus, not in blame of Him—as you meant it to be. And who will believe you
Enter Input : about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That’s not the idea of it
Enter Input : in the Orthodox Church.... That’s Rome, and not even the whole of Rome,
Enter Input : it’s false—those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the
Enter Input : Jesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your
Enter Input : Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who
Enter Input : are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves
Enter Input : for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know the
Enter Input : Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you
Enter Input : describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply the
Enter Input : Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with
Enter Input : the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that’s their ideal, but there’s no
Enter Input : sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It’s simple lust of
Enter Input : power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination—something like a universal
Enter Input : serfdom with them as masters—that’s all they stand for. They don’t even
Enter Input : believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, stay,” laughed Ivan, “how hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it be
Enter Input : so! Of course it’s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really think
Enter Input : that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing
Enter Input : but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is that Father Païssy’s
Enter Input : teaching?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something rather the
Enter Input : same as you ... but of course it’s not the same, not a bit the same,”
Enter Input : Alyosha hastily corrected himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A precious admission, in spite of your ‘not a bit the same.’ I ask you
Enter Input : why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material
Enter Input : gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow
Enter Input : and loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was one such man
Enter Input : among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain—if there’s
Enter Input : only one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert
Enter Input : and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and
Enter Input : perfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes
Enter Input : were opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain
Enter Input : perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction that
Enter Input : millions of God’s creatures have been created as a mockery, that they will
Enter Input : never be capable of using their freedom, that these poor rebels can never
Enter Input : turn into giants to complete the tower, that it was not for such geese
Enter Input : that the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that he
Enter Input : turned back and joined—the clever people. Surely that could have
Enter Input : happened?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Joined whom, what clever people?” cried Alyosha, completely carried away.
Enter Input : “They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets....
Enter Input : Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that’s all their secret. Your Inquisitor does
Enter Input : not believe in God, that’s his secret!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It’s perfectly true, it’s
Enter Input : true that that’s the whole secret, but isn’t that suffering, at least for
Enter Input : a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could
Enter Input : not shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old age he reached
Enter Input : the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit
Enter Input : could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly,
Enter Input : ‘incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.’ And so, convinced of
Enter Input : this, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the
Enter Input : dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and
Enter Input : deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet
Enter Input : deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being
Enter Input : led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think
Enter Input : themselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose
Enter Input : ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that
Enter Input : tragic? And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army ‘filled
Enter Input : with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain’—would not one
Enter Input : such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the
Enter Input : head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with
Enter Input : all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I
Enter Input : firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood
Enter Input : at the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such even
Enter Input : among the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old
Enter Input : man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found even
Enter Input : now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by
Enter Input : agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the
Enter Input : mystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them
Enter Input : happy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even
Enter Input : among the Masons there’s something of the same mystery at the bottom, and
Enter Input : that that’s why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals
Enter Input : breaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there
Enter Input : should be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea
Enter Input : I might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are perhaps a Mason yourself!” broke suddenly from Alyosha. “You
Enter Input : don’t believe in God,” he added, speaking this time very sorrowfully. He
Enter Input : fancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically. “How does
Enter Input : your poem end?” he asked, suddenly looking down. “Or was it the end?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he
Enter Input : waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed down
Enter Input : upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time,
Enter Input : looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply. The old man
Enter Input : longed for Him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But He
Enter Input : suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his
Enter Input : bloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His
Enter Input : lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: ‘Go, and come
Enter Input : no more ... come not at all, never, never!’ And he let Him out into the
Enter Input : dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the old man?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you with him, you too?” cried Alyosha, mournfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, it’s all nonsense, Alyosha. It’s only a senseless poem of a
Enter Input : senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do you
Enter Input : take it so seriously? Surely you don’t suppose I am going straight off to
Enter Input : the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord, it’s
Enter Input : no business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, and
Enter Input : then ... dash the cup to the ground!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky,
Enter Input : and the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?”
Enter Input : Alyosha cried sorrowfully. “With such a hell in your heart and your head,
Enter Input : how can you? No, that’s just what you are going away for, to join them ...
Enter Input : if not, you will kill yourself, you can’t endure it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is a strength to endure everything,” Ivan said with a cold smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What strength?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The strength of the Karamazovs—the strength of the Karamazov baseness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it,
Enter Input : and then—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That’s impossible
Enter Input : with your ideas.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the Karamazov way, again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Everything is lawful,’ you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, you’ve caught up yesterday’s phrase, which so offended Miüsov—and
Enter Input : which Dmitri pounced upon so naïvely, and paraphrased!” he smiled queerly.
Enter Input : “Yes, if you like, ‘everything is lawful’ since the word has been said. I
Enter Input : won’t deny it. And Mitya’s version isn’t bad.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha looked at him in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thought that going away from here I have you at least,” Ivan said
Enter Input : suddenly, with unexpected feeling; “but now I see that there is no place
Enter Input : for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, ‘all is lawful,’ I
Enter Input : won’t renounce—will you renounce me for that, yes?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s plagiarism,” cried Ivan, highly delighted. “You stole that from my
Enter Input : poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it’s time we were going, both of
Enter Input : us.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the
Enter Input : restaurant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, Alyosha,” Ivan began in a resolute voice, “if I am really able to
Enter Input : care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you.
Enter Input : It’s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan’t lose my
Enter Input : desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of
Enter Input : love if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left. And it’s
Enter Input : enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don’t go away to-morrow (I
Enter Input : think I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don’t say a word more on
Enter Input : these subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you
Enter Input : specially, never speak to me again,” he added, with sudden irritation;
Enter Input : “it’s all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn’t it?
Enter Input : And I’ll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want to
Enter Input : ‘dash the cup to the ground,’ wherever I may be I’ll come to have one more
Enter Input : talk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that.
Enter Input : I’ll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you,
Enter Input : to see what you’ll be by that time. It’s rather a solemn promise, you see.
Enter Input : And we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your
Enter Input : Pater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry
Enter Input : with me for having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; that’s right, now
Enter Input : go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just as
Enter Input : Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very
Enter Input : different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha’s
Enter Input : mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little,
Enter Input : looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he
Enter Input : walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had
Enter Input : never noticed it before. But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to
Enter Input : the monastery. It was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened;
Enter Input : something new was growing up in him for which he could not account. The
Enter Input : wind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines
Enter Input : murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse. He almost
Enter Input : ran. “Pater Seraphicus—he got that name from somewhere—where from?”
Enter Input : Alyosha wondered. “Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?...
Enter Input : Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will
Enter Input : save me—from him and for ever!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Several times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving Ivan so
Enter Input : completely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only a
Enter Input : few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing
Enter Input : so, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure One
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s house.
Enter Input : But, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, which
Enter Input : grew greater at every step he took towards the house. There was nothing
Enter Input : strange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not
Enter Input : have said what was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before,
Enter Input : and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when
Enter Input : he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was
Enter Input : preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown
Enter Input : future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had great
Enter Input : hopes, and great—too great—expectations from life, he could not have given
Enter Input : any definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown
Enter Input : certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something
Enter Input : quite different. “Is it loathing for my father’s house?” he wondered.
Enter Input : “Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it’s the last time I shall
Enter Input : cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it’s not that
Enter Input : either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with
Enter Input : him? For so many years I’ve been silent with the whole world and not
Enter Input : deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.”
Enter Input : It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful
Enter Input : inexperience and vanity—vexation at having failed to express himself,
Enter Input : especially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly
Enter Input : been reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done
Enter Input : indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. “I feel sick with
Enter Input : depression and yet I can’t tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan tried “not to think,” but that, too, was no use. What made his
Enter Input : depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual,
Enter Input : external character—he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to be
Enter Input : standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself
Enter Input : upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that
Enter Input : for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost
Enter Input : torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object,
Enter Input : often quite a trifling and ridiculous one—some article left about in the
Enter Input : wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the
Enter Input : shelf, and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, and
Enter Input : suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was
Enter Input : fretting and worrying him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the
Enter Input : coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the
Enter Input : valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soul
Enter Input : loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just before,
Enter Input : when Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had
Enter Input : felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred
Enter Input : responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had
Enter Input : been forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as
Enter Input : soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten
Enter Input : sensation began to obtrude itself again. “Is it possible that a miserable,
Enter Input : contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?” he wondered, with
Enter Input : insufferable irritation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the
Enter Input : man, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to notice in
Enter Input : himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature.
Enter Input : Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came
Enter Input : to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then he had taken a
Enter Input : marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He
Enter Input : had encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a
Enter Input : certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not
Enter Input : understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the
Enter Input : brain of “the contemplative.” They discussed philosophical questions and
Enter Input : even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon,
Enter Input : and stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be
Enter Input : understood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might
Enter Input : be an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : and that he was looking for something altogether different. In one way and
Enter Input : another, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too,
Enter Input : and that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on,
Enter Input : there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and
Enter Input : there had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri—they discussed that,
Enter Input : too. But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it
Enter Input : was impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in
Enter Input : fact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of
Enter Input : his desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously
Enter Input : premeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, and
Enter Input : usually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse into
Enter Input : silence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most
Enter Input : and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity
Enter Input : which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not that he forgot
Enter Input : himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully,
Enter Input : yet he had obviously begun to consider—goodness knows why!—that there was
Enter Input : some sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always
Enter Input : spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact,
Enter Input : some secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on both
Enter Input : sides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around
Enter Input : them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of his
Enter Input : growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root of
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gate
Enter Input : without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose from the
Enter Input : bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he wanted
Enter Input : particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and the fact
Enter Input : that he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the minute before,
Enter Input : drove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov’s
Enter Input : emasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his
Enter Input : forehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, “Where are you
Enter Input : going? You won’t pass by; you see that we two clever people have something
Enter Input : to say to each other.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan shook. “Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?” was
Enter Input : on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heard
Enter Input : himself say, “Is my father still asleep, or has he waked?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at once,
Enter Input : again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant he felt
Enter Input : almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov stood facing
Enter Input : him, his hands behind his back, looking at him with assurance and almost
Enter Input : severity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His honor is still asleep,” he articulated deliberately (“You were the
Enter Input : first to speak, not I,” he seemed to say). “I am surprised at you, sir,”
Enter Input : he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his right
Enter Input : foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you surprised at me?” Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing his
Enter Input : utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that he
Enter Input : was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have gone
Enter Input : away without satisfying it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why don’t you go to Tchermashnya, sir?” Smerdyakov suddenly raised his
Enter Input : eyes and smiled familiarly. “Why I smile you must understand of yourself,
Enter Input : if you are a clever man,” his screwed-up left eye seemed to say.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why should I go to Tchermashnya?” Ivan asked in surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was silent again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,” he said at last, slowly
Enter Input : and apparently attaching no significance to his answer. “I put you off
Enter Input : with a secondary reason,” he seemed to suggest, “simply to say something.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn you! Speak out what you want!” Ivan cried angrily at last, passing
Enter Input : from meekness to violence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but
Enter Input : still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Substantially nothing—but just by way of conversation.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan
Enter Input : knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before
Enter Input : him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or
Enter Input : not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov
Enter Input : seemed to seize the moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don’t know how to help
Enter Input : myself,” he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he
Enter Input : sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,”
Enter Input : Smerdyakov went on. “I am speaking of your parent and your brother Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin
Enter Input : worrying me every minute, ‘Has she come? Why hasn’t she come?’ and so on
Enter Input : up till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna
Enter Input : doesn’t come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he
Enter Input : will be at me again to-morrow morning, ‘Why hasn’t she come? When will she
Enter Input : come?’—as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it’s no better.
Enter Input : As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his
Enter Input : gun in his hands: ‘Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker. If you miss her
Enter Input : and don’t let me know she’s been—I’ll kill you before any one.’ When the
Enter Input : night’s over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins
Enter Input : worrying me to death. ‘Why hasn’t she come? Will she come soon?’ And he,
Enter Input : too, thinks me to blame because his lady hasn’t come. And every day and
Enter Input : every hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall
Enter Input : kill myself in a fright. I can’t depend upon them, sir.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch?” said Ivan irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven’t meddled at all, if
Enter Input : you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very
Enter Input : beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his servant.
Enter Input : He has had only one thing to say since: ‘I’ll kill you, you scoundrel, if
Enter Input : you miss her,’ I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fit
Enter Input : to-morrow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by ‘a long fit’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A long fit, lasting a long time—several hours, or perhaps a day or two.
Enter Input : Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. The
Enter Input : struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn’t come
Enter Input : back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor
Enter Input : here, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might
Enter Input : have died.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But they say one can’t tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What
Enter Input : makes you say you will have one to-morrow?” Ivan inquired, with a
Enter Input : peculiar, irritable curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just so. You can’t tell beforehand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Besides, you fell from the garret then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again
Enter Input : to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to go
Enter Input : into the cellar every day, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan took a long look at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don’t quite understand you,” he
Enter Input : said softly, but with a sort of menace. “Do you mean to pretend to be ill
Enter Input : to-morrow for three days, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toe
Enter Input : of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and,
Enter Input : grinning, articulated:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit—and
Enter Input : it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them—I should have a
Enter Input : perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For even if
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill, his honor
Enter Input : can’t blame a sick man for not telling him. He’d be ashamed to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hang it all!” Ivan cried, his face working with anger, “why are you
Enter Input : always in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri’s threats are
Enter Input : only hasty words and mean nothing. He won’t kill you; it’s not you he’ll
Enter Input : kill!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’d kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am
Enter Input : afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something
Enter Input : crazy to his father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why should you be taken for an accomplice?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’ll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals as a
Enter Input : great secret.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m bound to admit the fact,” Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure,
Enter Input : “that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business. As you know
Enter Input : yourself (if only you do know it) he has for several days past locked
Enter Input : himself in as soon as night or even evening comes on. Of late you’ve been
Enter Input : going upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did not
Enter Input : come down at all, and so perhaps you don’t know how carefully he has begun
Enter Input : to lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to
Enter Input : the door he won’t open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory
Enter Input : Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his room
Enter Input : now. That’s the arrangement he made himself ever since this to-do with
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his orders, I go away to the
Enter Input : lodge so that I don’t get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch,
Enter Input : getting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna
Enter Input : to come. For the last few days he’s been perfectly frantic expecting her.
Enter Input : What he argues is, she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he
Enter Input : calls him), ‘and so,’ says he, ‘she’ll come the back-way, late at night,
Enter Input : to me. You look out for her,’ says he, ‘till midnight and later; and if
Enter Input : she does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the
Enter Input : garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more
Enter Input : quickly, then,’ says he, ‘I shall understand at once that she has come,
Enter Input : and will open the door to you quietly.’ Another signal he gave me in case
Enter Input : anything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an
Enter Input : interval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something has
Enter Input : happened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so that
Enter Input : I can go and speak to him. That’s all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can’t
Enter Input : come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might
Enter Input : come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully afraid
Enter Input : of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and
Enter Input : were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere
Enter Input : near at the time, I should be bound to let him know at once, knocking
Enter Input : three times. So that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena
Enter Input : Alexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks means
Enter Input : ‘something important to tell you.’ His honor has shown me them several
Enter Input : times and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of
Enter Input : these signals but myself and his honor, so he’d open the door without the
Enter Input : slightest hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of
Enter Input : calling out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : too, now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back from
Enter Input : him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, ‘You are deceiving me,
Enter Input : you are hiding something from me! I’ll break both your legs for you.’ So I
Enter Input : told him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion, and
Enter Input : might be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was telling him all I
Enter Input : could.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you think that he’ll make use of those signals and try to get in,
Enter Input : don’t let him in.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming in
Enter Input : then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confound
Enter Input : you? Are you laughing at me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this fear
Enter Input : on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment. Fright
Enter Input : alone will bring it on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. Let
Enter Input : Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signals
Enter Input : without orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearing
Enter Input : him and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and Marfa
Enter Input : Ignatyevna intends to give him medicine to-morrow. They’ve just arranged
Enter Input : it. It’s a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a
Enter Input : preparation and always keeps it. It’s a strong thing made from some herb.
Enter Input : She has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch
Enter Input : three times a year when his lumbago’s so bad he is almost paralyzed by it.
Enter Input : Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his whole back
Enter Input : for half an hour till it’s quite red and swollen, and what’s left in the
Enter Input : bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but not quite all,
Enter Input : for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and drinks it herself.
Enter Input : And as they never take strong drink, I assure you they both drop asleep at
Enter Input : once and sleep sound a very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch
Enter Input : wakes up he is perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a
Enter Input : headache from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention
Enter Input : to-morrow, they won’t hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
Enter Input : They’ll be asleep.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it were
Enter Input : planned. You’ll have a fit and they’ll both be unconscious,” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : “But aren’t you trying to arrange it so?” broke from him suddenly, and he
Enter Input : frowned threateningly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, he’ll do it;
Enter Input : but if not, I shan’t be thrusting him upon his father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you say
Enter Input : yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won’t come at all?” Ivan went on, turning
Enter Input : white with anger. “You say that yourself, and all the while I’ve been
Enter Input : here, I’ve felt sure it was all the old man’s fancy, and the creature
Enter Input : won’t come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she doesn’t come?
Enter Input : Speak, I want to know what you are thinking!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know yourself why he’ll come. What’s the use of what I think? His
Enter Input : honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account of
Enter Input : my illness perhaps, and he’ll dash in, as he did yesterday through
Enter Input : impatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasn’t escaped him on
Enter Input : the sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big
Enter Input : envelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed
Enter Input : with three seals. On it is written in his own hand, ‘To my angel
Enter Input : Grushenka, if she will come,’ to which he added three days later, ‘for my
Enter Input : little chicken.’ There’s no knowing what that might do.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense!” cried Ivan, almost beside himself. “Dmitri won’t come to steal
Enter Input : money and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him yesterday on
Enter Input : account of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is, but he won’t
Enter Input : steal.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is in very great need of money now—the greatest need, Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch. You don’t know in what need he is,” Smerdyakov explained,
Enter Input : with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. “He looks on that
Enter Input : three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. ‘My father still
Enter Input : owes me just three thousand,’ he said. And besides that, consider, Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. It’s as good as
Enter Input : certain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only she
Enter Input : cares to, to marry her—the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch—if
Enter Input : only she cares to, and of course she may care to. All I’ve said is that
Enter Input : she won’t come, but maybe she’s looking for more than that—I mean to be
Enter Input : mistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing
Enter Input : with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a
Enter Input : stupid thing to do. And she’s got plenty of sense. She wouldn’t marry a
Enter Input : beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself
Enter Input : and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the
Enter Input : master’s death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him
Enter Input : simply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your
Enter Input : father were to die now, there’d be some forty thousand for sure, even for
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he’s made no will.... Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A sort of shudder passed over Ivan’s face. He suddenly flushed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then why on earth,” he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, “do you advise me
Enter Input : to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see
Enter Input : what will happen here.” Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Precisely so,” said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan
Enter Input : intently, however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by ‘precisely so’?” Ivan questioned him, with a menacing
Enter Input : light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should
Enter Input : simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,”
Enter Input : answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan’s flashing
Enter Input : eyes. They were both silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what’s more ... an awful scoundrel,
Enter Input : too.” Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight
Enter Input : through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something
Enter Input : strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his
Enter Input : fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The
Enter Input : latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back.
Enter Input : But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in
Enter Input : silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know—early to-morrow
Enter Input : morning. That’s all!” he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself
Enter Input : afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s the best thing you can do,” he responded, as though he had
Enter Input : expected to hear it; “except that you can always be telegraphed for from
Enter Input : Moscow, if anything should happen here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change
Enter Input : had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness had
Enter Input : completely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation,
Enter Input : intent but timid and cringing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Haven’t you something more to say—something to add?” could be read in the
Enter Input : intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And couldn’t I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too—in case anything
Enter Input : happened?” Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his
Enter Input : voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,” Smerdyakov muttered,
Enter Input : almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivan’s
Enter Input : eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save my
Enter Input : spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, that
Enter Input : you insist on Tchermashnya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Precisely so ...” muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He looked
Enter Input : at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back. But to
Enter Input : his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate still
Enter Input : laughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment would have known
Enter Input : that he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he could not have
Enter Input : explained himself what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked
Enter Input : as though in a nervous frenzy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. “It’s Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : in the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to him, waving his
Enter Input : hands, “I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you. Good-by!” and
Enter Input : passed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the old
Enter Input : man was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremonious
Enter Input : display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old
Enter Input : man evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet
Enter Input : him in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he
Enter Input : stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going
Enter Input : upstairs, till he passed out of sight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter with him?” he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had
Enter Input : followed Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Angry about something. Who can tell?” the valet muttered evasively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get along
Enter Input : with you. Look sharp! No news?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complained
Enter Input : of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these questions we
Enter Input : will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old man
Enter Input : was wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing
Enter Input : every minute the five knocks agreed upon. Now and then he peered out into
Enter Input : the darkness, seeing nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up late
Enter Input : that night, till two o’clock. But we will not give an account of his
Enter Input : thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul—its turn will
Enter Input : come. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account of
Enter Input : them, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something very vague,
Enter Input : and, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his
Enter Input : bearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost
Enter Input : surprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an
Enter Input : intense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the
Enter Input : lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not have
Enter Input : given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one
Enter Input : who had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world. On the other
Enter Input : hand, he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable
Enter Input : humiliating terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical
Enter Input : powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling
Enter Input : in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He even
Enter Input : hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had with him. At
Enter Input : moments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot
Enter Input : to think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he
Enter Input : remembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered
Enter Input : in his heart, “That’s nonsense, you are not going, and it won’t be so easy
Enter Input : to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar
Enter Input : repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, as
Enter Input : though he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on the
Enter Input : staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below, had
Enter Input : listened a long while—some five minutes—with a sort of strange curiosity,
Enter Input : holding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this,
Enter Input : why he was listening, he could not have said. That “action” all his life
Enter Input : afterwards he called “infamous,” and at the bottom of his heart, he
Enter Input : thought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious
Enter Input : to know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now.
Enter Input : He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows
Enter Input : and stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening—for some one
Enter Input : to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : About two o’clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep at
Enter Input : once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at once, and
Enter Input : slept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven o’clock, when it
Enter Input : was broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himself
Enter Input : extraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then
Enter Input : dragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His linen had come
Enter Input : back from the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at
Enter Input : the thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his
Enter Input : departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before (to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day,
Enter Input : yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed,
Enter Input : or, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would be
Enter Input : to pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine
Enter Input : o’clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, “Where will
Enter Input : your honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?” He looked
Enter Input : almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,
Enter Input : something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even
Enter Input : inquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear his
Enter Input : answer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour to
Enter Input : return to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses. His
Enter Input : father heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an
Enter Input : unmannerly way to show regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew
Enter Input : into a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his
Enter Input : own.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we’ll manage
Enter Input : it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to Tchermashnya on
Enter Input : the way. It’s only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, only
Enter Input : another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m sorry, I can’t. It’s eighty versts to the railway and the train
Enter Input : starts for Moscow at seven o’clock to-night. I can only just catch it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off to
Enter Input : Tchermashnya. It won’t put you out much to humor your father! If I hadn’t
Enter Input : had something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, for
Enter Input : I’ve some business there in a hurry. But here I ... it’s not the time for
Enter Input : me to go now.... You see, I’ve two pieces of copse land there. The
Enter Input : Maslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight thousand for the
Enter Input : timber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given
Enter Input : twelve. There’s no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have
Enter Input : it all their own way. One has to take what they’ll give, for no one here
Enter Input : dare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday
Enter Input : that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makes
Enter Input : him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not afraid of
Enter Input : the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse. Do you
Enter Input : hear? But he’ll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, so
Enter Input : you must go at once and make a bargain with him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you write to the priest; he’ll make the bargain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He can’t do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure, I’d
Enter Input : give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but he
Enter Input : has no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him.
Enter Input : And yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looks
Enter Input : like a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That’s
Enter Input : the common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you
Enter Input : wonder why he is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife
Enter Input : was dead and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there
Enter Input : was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is
Enter Input : alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you have
Enter Input : to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when he says he
Enter Input : wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by
Enter Input : which you can judge about Gorstkin. I’ve done business with him a long
Enter Input : time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red beard.
Enter Input : If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, it’s all right, he is
Enter Input : saying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he strokes his beard
Enter Input : with his left hand and grins—he is trying to cheat you. Don’t watch his
Enter Input : eyes, you won’t find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a
Enter Input : rogue—but watch his beard! I’ll give you a note and you show it to him.
Enter Input : He’s called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy(4); but don’t call
Enter Input : him so, he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and
Enter Input : see it’s all right, write here at once. You need only write: ‘He’s not
Enter Input : lying.’ Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, but
Enter Input : not more. Just think! there’s a difference between eight thousand and
Enter Input : eleven thousand. It’s as good as picking up three thousand; it’s not so
Enter Input : easy to find a purchaser, and I’m in desperate need of money. Only let me
Enter Input : know it’s serious, and I’ll run over and fix it up. I’ll snatch the time
Enter Input : somehow. But what’s the good of my galloping over, if it’s all a notion of
Enter Input : the priest’s? Come, will you go?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I can’t spare the time. You must excuse me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, you might oblige your father. I shan’t forget it. You’ve no heart,
Enter Input : any of you—that’s what it is? What’s a day or two to you? Where are you
Enter Input : going now—to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I would have
Enter Input : sent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you
Enter Input : just because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don’t see that? You
Enter Input : know nothing about timber, but you’ve got an eye. All that is wanted is to
Enter Input : see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard—if his
Enter Input : beard shakes you know he is in earnest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?” cried
Enter Input : Ivan, with a malignant smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy, but
Enter Input : he caught the smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you’ll go, you’ll go? I’ll scribble the note for you at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know whether I shall go. I don’t know. I’ll decide on the way.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle the
Enter Input : matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he’ll send it on to me
Enter Input : at once. And I won’t delay you more than that. You can go to Venice. The
Enter Input : priest will give you horses back to Volovya station.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for the
Enter Input : horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to-day he seemed to restrain
Enter Input : himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite
Enter Input : unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to
Enter Input : say. Ivan noticed this particularly. “He must be bored with me,” he
Enter Input : thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man
Enter Input : began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold
Enter Input : out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and
Enter Input : instantly pulled himself up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!” he repeated from the steps.
Enter Input : “You’ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be
Enter Input : glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan got into the carriage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Ivan! Don’t be too hard on me!” the father called for the last
Enter Input : time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The whole household came out to take leave—Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory.
Enter Input : Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the
Enter Input : carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,” broke suddenly from Ivan. Again,
Enter Input : as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed,
Enter Input : too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a true saying then, that ‘it’s always worth while speaking to a
Enter Input : clever man,’ ” answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan’s soul, but he looked
Enter Input : eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flock
Enter Input : of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a sudden he
Enter Input : felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt intensely
Enter Input : interested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute later he
Enter Input : realized that he was not catching anything, and that he had not really
Enter Input : even taken in the peasant’s answer. He was silent, and it was pleasant
Enter Input : even so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images of
Enter Input : Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled,
Enter Input : blew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. “There’s plenty
Enter Input : of time for them,” he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed
Enter Input : horses, and galloped to Volovya. “Why is it worth while speaking to a
Enter Input : clever man? What did he mean by that?” The thought seemed suddenly to
Enter Input : clutch at his breathing. “And why did I tell him I was going to
Enter Input : Tchermashnya?” They reached Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage,
Enter Input : and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve
Enter Input : versts to Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went into
Enter Input : the station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer’s wife, and
Enter Input : suddenly went back to the entrance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven,
Enter Input : brothers?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure. Mitri here will.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father’s, to Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : Karamazov, and tell him I haven’t gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course I can. I’ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And here’s something for you, for I dare say he won’t give you anything,”
Enter Input : said Ivan, laughing gayly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You may depend on it he won’t.” Mitya laughed too. “Thank you, sir. I’ll
Enter Input : be sure to do it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At seven o’clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow “Away with
Enter Input : the past. I’ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news,
Enter Input : no echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!” But
Enter Input : instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart
Enter Input : ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was
Enter Input : thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he
Enter Input : was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am a scoundrel,” he whispered to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For
Enter Input : two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. But
Enter Input : suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for
Enter Input : every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell
Enter Input : down from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the
Enter Input : yard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his
Enter Input : scream—the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her—the scream of
Enter Input : the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had
Enter Input : come on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must
Enter Input : have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had
Enter Input : caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them. They
Enter Input : found him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and
Enter Input : foaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have broken
Enter Input : something—an arm or a leg—and hurt himself, but “God had preserved him,”
Enter Input : as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it—nothing of the kind had happened. But it
Enter Input : was difficult to get him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to
Enter Input : help and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the
Enter Input : whole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man did
Enter Input : not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then
Enter Input : began again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as
Enter Input : had happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret.
Enter Input : They remembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was still
Enter Input : ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the
Enter Input : evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at
Enter Input : once. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and
Enter Input : conscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, he
Enter Input : concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious
Enter Input : consequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it,
Enter Input : but that by to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he
Enter Input : would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the lodge,
Enter Input : to a room next to Grigory’s and Marfa Ignatyevna’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with
Enter Input : that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared with
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s, was “no better than dish-water,” and the fowl was so dried
Enter Input : up that it was impossible to masticate it. To her master’s bitter, though
Enter Input : deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very
Enter Input : old one to begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. In
Enter Input : the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he
Enter Input : was informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days,
Enter Input : was completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea
Enter Input : as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He was in
Enter Input : terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka’s
Enter Input : coming almost as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning
Enter Input : an assurance “that she had promised to come without fail.” The
Enter Input : incorrigible old man’s heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and
Enter Input : down his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be
Enter Input : on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window
Enter Input : (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where
Enter Input : and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a
Enter Input : second in the passage, for fear—which God forbid!—that she should be
Enter Input : frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never
Enter Input : had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could
Enter Input : say almost certainly that she would come!

Enter Input : Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder’s cell,
Enter Input : he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp,
Enter Input : perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up
Enter Input : in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and
Enter Input : cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful
Enter Input : conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour
Enter Input : before Alyosha’s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell
Enter Input : earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident
Enter Input : assurance from Father Païssy that “the teacher would get up, and as he had
Enter Input : himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his
Enter Input : heart.” This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father
Enter Input : Païssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious, if he had
Enter Input : seen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise that he would rise up
Enter Input : and say good-by to him, he would not have believed perhaps even in death,
Enter Input : but would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill his
Enter Input : promise. In the morning as he lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told
Enter Input : him positively: “I shall not die without the delight of another
Enter Input : conversation with you, beloved of my heart. I shall look once more on your
Enter Input : dear face and pour out my heart to you once again.” The monks, who had
Enter Input : gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had all
Enter Input : been his devoted friends for many years. There were four of them: Father
Enter Input : Iosif and Father Païssy, Father Mihaïl, the warden of the hermitage, a man
Enter Input : not very old and far from being learned. He was of humble origin, of
Enter Input : strong will and steadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deep
Enter Input : tenderness, though he obviously concealed it as though he were almost
Enter Input : ashamed of it. The fourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little
Enter Input : monk of the poorest peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very
Enter Input : quiet, scarcely speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble,
Enter Input : and looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful
Enter Input : beyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great affection
Enter Input : for this timorous man, and always treated him with marked respect, though
Enter Input : perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less, in spite
Enter Input : of the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him.
Enter Input : That was very long ago, forty years before, when Father Zossima first
Enter Input : began his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and
Enter Input : when, shortly after, he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to
Enter Input : collect alms for their poor monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, was
Enter Input : very small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them (in
Enter Input : addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit round Father Zossima on
Enter Input : chairs brought from the sitting-room. It was already beginning to get
Enter Input : dark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the
Enter Input : ikons.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima smiled
Enter Input : at him joyfully and held out his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew you
Enter Input : would come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and wept.
Enter Input : Something surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering, he wanted to
Enter Input : sob.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, don’t weep over me yet,” Father Zossima smiled, laying his right
Enter Input : hand on his head. “You see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall live
Enter Input : another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, with
Enter Input : her little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday. God bless the mother
Enter Input : and the little girl Lizaveta,” he crossed himself. “Porfiry, did you take
Enter Input : her offering where I told you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good-humored
Enter Input : woman to be given “to some one poorer than me.” Such offerings, always of
Enter Input : money gained by personal toil, are made by way of penance voluntarily
Enter Input : undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow,
Enter Input : whose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone
Enter Input : with her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had
Enter Input : given the money, as he had been instructed, “from an unknown
Enter Input : benefactress.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Get up, my dear boy,” the elder went on to Alyosha. “Let me look at you.
Enter Input : Have you been home and seen your brother?” It seemed strange to Alyosha
Enter Input : that he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothers
Enter Input : only—but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and
Enter Input : to-day for the sake of that brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have seen one of my brothers,” answered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste, leave
Enter Input : everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent
Enter Input : something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store
Enter Input : for him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange.
Enter Input : Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances
Enter Input : with Father Païssy. Alyosha could not resist asking:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father and teacher,” he began with extreme emotion, “your words are too
Enter Input : obscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though
Enter Input : his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came into his eyes—so
Enter Input : that I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing for
Enter Input : himself. Once or twice in my life I’ve seen such a look in a man’s face
Enter Input : ... reflecting as it were his future fate, and that fate, alas, came to
Enter Input : pass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I thought your brotherly face would
Enter Input : help him. But everything and all our fates are from the Lord. ‘Except a
Enter Input : corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it
Enter Input : die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’ Remember that. You, Alexey, I’ve many
Enter Input : times silently blessed for your face, know that,” added the elder with a
Enter Input : gentle smile. “This is what I think of you, you will go forth from these
Enter Input : walls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have many enemies,
Enter Input : but even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes,
Enter Input : but you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will
Enter Input : make others bless it—which is what matters most. Well, that is your
Enter Input : character. Fathers and teachers,” he addressed his friends with a tender
Enter Input : smile, “I have never till to-day told even him why the face of this youth
Enter Input : is so dear to me. Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were a
Enter Input : remembrance and a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a
Enter Input : child I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And
Enter Input : later on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that
Enter Input : brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For had he
Enter Input : not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, have
Enter Input : become a monk and entered on this precious path. He appeared first to me
Enter Input : in my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he seems to have
Enter Input : come to me over again. It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey,
Enter Input : who has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like
Enter Input : him spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that young man, my
Enter Input : brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a
Enter Input : reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so strange a
Enter Input : dream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?” he turned to the novice who
Enter Input : waited on him. “Many times I’ve seen in your face as it were a look of
Enter Input : mortification that I love Alexey more than you. Now you know why that was
Enter Input : so, but I love you too, know that, and many times I grieved at your
Enter Input : mortification. I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my
Enter Input : brother, for there has been no presence in my life more precious, more
Enter Input : significant and touching. My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my
Enter Input : whole life at this moment as though living through it again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :                   -------------------------------------
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with the
Enter Input : friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partly
Enter Input : preserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down from
Enter Input : memory, some time after his elder’s death. But whether this was only the
Enter Input : conversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of
Enter Input : parts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his
Enter Input : account, Father Zossima’s talk goes on without interruption, as though he
Enter Input : told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no
Enter Input : doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was
Enter Input : general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they
Enter Input : too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father
Enter Input : Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was
Enter Input : sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down
Enter Input : to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not
Enter Input : leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by
Enter Input : Father Païssy’s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one
Enter Input : of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his
Enter Input : life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new
Enter Input : strength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a
Enter Input : last effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little
Enter Input : time, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that
Enter Input : later. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the
Enter Input : account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not
Enter Input : so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great
Enter Input : deal from previous conversations and added them to it.

Enter Input : taken from his own words by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(a)_ _Father Zossima’s Brother_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the
Enter Input : north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no
Enter Input : great consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old, and
Enter Input : I don’t remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built of
Enter Input : wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and her
Enter Input : children in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I.
Enter Input : He was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but
Enter Input : kind-hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at
Enter Input : home with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did
Enter Input : not get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so
Enter Input : my mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen,
Enter Input : he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow
Enter Input : to our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was a
Enter Input : good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university.
Enter Input : Something made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see
Enter Input : him. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter,
Enter Input : till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his
Enter Input : own request, as he had powerful friends.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude and
Enter Input : laughed at it. “That’s all silly twaddle, and there is no God,” he said,
Enter Input : horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was only
Enter Input : nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four servants, all
Enter Input : serfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, who
Enter Input : was lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant
Enter Input : to take her place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a
Enter Input : tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin and
Enter Input : delicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he caught
Enter Input : cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it was
Enter Input : galloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring. My
Enter Input : mother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she entreated
Enter Input : him to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he was still
Enter Input : able to move about. This made him angry, and he said something profane
Enter Input : about the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he
Enter Input : was seriously ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to
Enter Input : confess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long time
Enter Input : past, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed at
Enter Input : dinner to our mother and me, “My life won’t be long among you, I may not
Enter Input : live another year,” which seemed now like a prophecy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Three days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning my
Enter Input : brother began going to church. “I am doing this simply for your sake,
Enter Input : mother, to please and comfort you,” he said. My mother wept with joy and
Enter Input : grief. “His end must be near,” she thought, “if there’s such a change in
Enter Input : him.” But he was not able to go to church long, he took to his bed, so he
Enter Input : had to confess and take the sacrament at home.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of
Enter Input : fragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly, but in
Enter Input : the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair. That’s how I
Enter Input : remember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his face bright and
Enter Input : joyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change passed over him, his
Enter Input : spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and say, “Let me
Enter Input : light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.” And once he would not have
Enter Input : allowed it and would have blown it out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it.
Enter Input : You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoice
Enter Input : seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her room and
Enter Input : weep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful.
Enter Input : “Mother, don’t weep, darling,” he would say, “I’ve long to live yet, long
Enter Input : to rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night,
Enter Input : coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t cry, mother,” he would answer, “life is paradise, and we are all in
Enter Input : paradise, but we won’t see it, if we would, we should have heaven on earth
Enter Input : the next day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Every one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively; we
Enter Input : were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us. “Dear ones,” he would
Enter Input : say to them, “what have I done that you should love me so, how can you
Enter Input : love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate
Enter Input : it before?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When the servants came in to him he would say continually, “Dear, kind
Enter Input : people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? If
Enter Input : it were God’s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should
Enter Input : wait on one another.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mother shook her head as she listened. “My darling, it’s your illness
Enter Input : makes you talk like that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mother, darling,” he would say, “there must be servants and masters, but
Enter Input : if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.
Enter Input : And another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, and
Enter Input : I more than any.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. “Why, how
Enter Input : could you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers and
Enter Input : murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you
Enter Input : hold yourself more guilty than all?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mother, little heart of mine,” he said (he had begun using such strange
Enter Input : caressing words at that time), “little heart of mine, my joy, believe me,
Enter Input : every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.
Enter Input : I don’t know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfully
Enter Input : even. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and not
Enter Input : knowing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full of
Enter Input : love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?” he would ask, joking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll live many days yet,” the doctor would answer, “and months and
Enter Input : years too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Months and years!” he would exclaim. “Why reckon the days? One day is
Enter Input : enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we quarrel,
Enter Input : try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other? Let’s go
Enter Input : straight into the garden, walk and play there, love, appreciate, and kiss
Enter Input : each other, and glorify life.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your son cannot last long,” the doctor told my mother, as she accompanied
Enter Input : him to the door. “The disease is affecting his brain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our garden was a
Enter Input : shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The first
Enter Input : birds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing at
Enter Input : the windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began suddenly
Enter Input : begging their forgiveness too: “Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me,
Enter Input : for I have sinned against you too.” None of us could understand that at
Enter Input : the time, but he shed tears of joy. “Yes,” he said, “there was such a
Enter Input : glory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in
Enter Input : shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You take too many sins on yourself,” mother used to say, weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mother, darling, it’s for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though I can’t
Enter Input : explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I don’t know
Enter Input : how to love them enough. If I have sinned against every one, yet all
Enter Input : forgive me, too, and that’s heaven. Am I not in heaven now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And there was a great deal more I don’t remember. I remember I went once
Enter Input : into his room when there was no one else there. It was a bright evening,
Enter Input : the sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He beckoned me,
Enter Input : and I went up to him. He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my
Enter Input : face tenderly, lovingly; he said nothing for a minute, only looked at me
Enter Input : like that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well,” he said, “run and play now, enjoy life for me too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life afterwards I
Enter Input : remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too. There
Enter Input : were many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his, though we did not
Enter Input : understand them at the time. He died the third week after Easter. He was
Enter Input : fully conscious though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did not
Enter Input : change. He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,
Enter Input : beckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his
Enter Input : death. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so,
Enter Input : though I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then, a child, but
Enter Input : a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my heart,
Enter Input : ready to rise up and respond when the time came. So indeed it happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her to send me
Enter Input : to Petersburg as other parents did. “You have only one son now,” they
Enter Input : said, “and have a fair income, and you will be depriving him perhaps of a
Enter Input : brilliant career if you keep him here.” They suggested I should be sent to
Enter Input : Petersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might afterwards enter the Imperial
Enter Input : Guard. My mother hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her
Enter Input : only child, but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without
Enter Input : many tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me to
Enter Input : Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again. For
Enter Input : she too died three years afterwards. She spent those three years mourning
Enter Input : and grieving for both of us.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious
Enter Input : memories, for there are no memories more precious than those of early
Enter Input : childhood in one’s first home. And that is almost always so if there is
Enter Input : any love and harmony in the family at all. Indeed, precious memories may
Enter Input : remain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what is
Enter Input : precious. With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible,
Enter Input : which, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of
Enter Input : Scripture history then with excellent pictures, called _A Hundred and Four
Enter Input : Stories from the Old and New Testament_, and I learned to read from it. I
Enter Input : have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious relic of the past.
Enter Input : But even before I learned to read, I remember first being moved to
Enter Input : devotional feeling at eight years old. My mother took me alone to mass (I
Enter Input : don’t remember where my brother was at the time) on the Monday before
Enter Input : Easter. It was a fine day, and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now,
Enter Input : how the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and,
Enter Input : overhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that
Enter Input : streamed in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the
Enter Input : first time in my life I consciously received the seed of God’s word in my
Enter Input : heart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book,
Enter Input : so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry it. He laid it
Enter Input : on the reading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for the
Enter Input : first time I understood something read in the church of God. In the land
Enter Input : of Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he had great
Enter Input : wealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted,
Enter Input : and he loved them very much and prayed for them. “It may be that my sons
Enter Input : have sinned in their feasting.” Now the devil came before the Lord
Enter Input : together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up
Enter Input : and down the earth and under the earth. “And hast thou considered my
Enter Input : servant Job?” God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil, pointing to
Enter Input : his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at God’s words. “Give
Enter Input : him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Thee
Enter Input : and curse Thy name.” And God gave up the just man He loved so, to the
Enter Input : devil. And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered his
Enter Input : wealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his
Enter Input : mantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, “Naked came I out of
Enter Input : my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gave
Enter Input : and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and
Enter Input : ever.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises up
Enter Input : again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of
Enter Input : a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder and
Enter Input : gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, who
Enter Input : talked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up to destruction,
Enter Input : and His servant crying out: “Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish
Enter Input : me,” and then the soft and sweet singing in the church: “Let my prayer
Enter Input : rise up before Thee,” and again incense from the priest’s censer and the
Enter Input : kneeling and the prayer. Ever since then—only yesterday I took it up—I’ve
Enter Input : never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much that
Enter Input : is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard
Enter Input : the words of mockery and blame, proud words, “How could God give up the
Enter Input : most loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his
Enter Input : children, smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption
Enter Input : from his sores with a pot-sherd—and for no object except to boast to the
Enter Input : devil! ‘See what My saint can suffer for My sake.’ ” But the greatness of
Enter Input : it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery—that the passing earthly
Enter Input : show and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of the
Enter Input : earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as on
Enter Input : the first days of creation He ended each day with praise: “That is good
Enter Input : that I have created,” looks upon Job and again praises His creation. And
Enter Input : Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His creation for
Enter Input : generations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he was
Enter Input : ordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are in
Enter Input : it! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with
Enter Input : it to man! It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature,
Enter Input : everything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what
Enter Input : mysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him wealth
Enter Input : again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. But
Enter Input : how could he love those new ones when those first children are no more,
Enter Input : when he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy with
Enter Input : those new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, he
Enter Input : could. It’s the great mystery of human life that old grief passes
Enter Input : gradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place
Enter Input : of the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as
Enter Input : before, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting,
Enter Input : its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come
Enter Input : with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life—and over
Enter Input : all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life is
Enter Input : ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my
Enter Input : earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching
Enter Input : life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind
Enter Input : glowing and my heart weeping with joy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one may
Enter Input : hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village priests,
Enter Input : are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their
Enter Input : humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print—I’ve read it
Enter Input : myself—that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people because
Enter Input : of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics come and
Enter Input : lead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because they have so
Enter Input : little to live upon. May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so
Enter Input : precious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say,
Enter Input : if any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may
Enter Input : be short of time, he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while
Enter Input : with work and services, but still it’s not all the time, even he has an
Enter Input : hour a week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year round.
Enter Input : Let him gather round him once a week, some hour in the evening, if only
Enter Input : the children at first—the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin
Enter Input : to come. There’s no need to build halls for this, let him take them into
Enter Input : his own cottage. They won’t spoil his cottage, they would only be there
Enter Input : one hour. Let him open that book and begin reading it without grand words
Enter Input : or superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly,
Enter Input : being glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with
Enter Input : attention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to
Enter Input : explain words that are not understood by the peasants. Don’t be anxious,
Enter Input : they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand all!
Enter Input : Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of how
Enter Input : Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said,
Enter Input : “This place is holy”—and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant.
Enter Input : Let him read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph,
Enter Input : the tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their
Enter Input : father that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him his
Enter Input : blood-stained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers afterwards
Enter Input : journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler,
Enter Input : unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother
Enter Input : Benjamin, and all through love: “I love you, and loving you I torment
Enter Input : you.” For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the
Enter Input : merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands,
Enter Input : he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a
Enter Input : strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them
Enter Input : beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them
Enter Input : at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his
Enter Input : bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and
Enter Input : told them, “Brothers, I am your brother Joseph!” Let him read them further
Enter Input : how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive,
Enter Input : and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign
Enter Input : land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in
Enter Input : his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, from
Enter Input : Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don’t be angry, that like a little
Enter Input : child I’ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a
Enter Input : hundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive my
Enter Input : tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the priest of God, and be
Enter Input : sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response. Only a
Enter Input : little tiny seed is needed—drop it into the heart of the peasant and it
Enter Input : won’t die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be hidden in the
Enter Input : midst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder.
Enter Input : And there’s no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it
Enter Input : all simply. Do you suppose that the peasants don’t understand? Try reading
Enter Input : them the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or the
Enter Input : miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don’t forget either the parables
Enter Input : of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke (that is what I
Enter Input : did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paul
Enter Input : (that you mustn’t leave out on any account), and from the _Lives of the
Enter Input : Saints_, for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of
Enter Input : all, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egypt—and you will
Enter Input : penetrate their hearts with these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it
Enter Input : in spite of your poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for
Enter Input : yourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a
Enter Input : hundred-fold. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words
Enter Input : they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in his
Enter Input : fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect than
Enter Input : before—so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too. The thing
Enter Input : is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for
Enter Input : fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believe
Enter Input : in God will not believe in God’s people. He who believes in God’s people
Enter Input : will see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it till
Enter Input : then. Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our
Enter Input : atheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And what is the use of Christ’s words, unless we set an example? The
Enter Input : people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the
Enter Input : Word and for all that is good.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia
Enter Input : with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one
Enter Input : night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. A
Enter Input : good-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry back
Enter Input : next morning to pull a merchant’s barge along the bank. I noticed him
Enter Input : looking straight before him with clear and tender eyes. It was a bright,
Enter Input : warm, still, July night, a cool mist rose from the broad river, we could
Enter Input : hear the plash of a fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and
Enter Input : beautiful, everything praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the
Enter Input : lad and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world of God’s and of the
Enter Input : great mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden
Enter Input : bee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have not
Enter Input : intelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually
Enter Input : accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear lad’s heart was moved. He told me
Enter Input : that he loved the forest and the forest birds. He was a bird-catcher, knew
Enter Input : the note of each of them, could call each bird. “I know nothing better
Enter Input : than to be in the forest,” said he, “though all things are good.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Truly,” I answered him, “all things are good and fair, because all is
Enter Input : truth. Look,” said I, “at the horse, that great beast that is so near to
Enter Input : man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works for him; look at
Enter Input : their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats them
Enter Input : mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what beauty! It’s
Enter Input : touching to know that there’s no sin in them, for all, all except man, is
Enter Input : sinless, and Christ has been with them before us.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why,” asked the boy, “is Christ with them too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It cannot but be so,” said I, “since the Word is for all. All creation
Enter Input : and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory to
Enter Input : God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of
Enter Input : their sinless life. Yonder,” said I, “in the forest wanders the dreadful
Enter Input : bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it.” And I told him how
Enter Input : once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in
Enter Input : the wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear and
Enter Input : gave him a piece of bread. “Go along,” said he, “Christ be with you,” and
Enter Input : the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm. And the
Enter Input : lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint,
Enter Input : and that Christ was with him too. “Ah,” said he, “how good that is, how
Enter Input : good and beautiful is all God’s work!” He sat musing softly and sweetly. I
Enter Input : saw he understood. And he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May
Enter Input : God bless youth! And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace
Enter Input : and light to Thy people!

Enter Input : Chapter II. The Duel
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(c) Recollections of Father Zossima’s Youth before he became a Monk. The
Enter Input : Duel_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school at
Enter Input : Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of my
Enter Input : childish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing. I picked up so
Enter Input : many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd,
Enter Input : almost savage creature. A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I
Enter Input : did acquire together with the French language.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service as
Enter Input : cattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was so
Enter Input : much more impressionable than my companions. By the time we left the
Enter Input : school as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor of
Enter Input : the regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of
Enter Input : honor, and if any one had known it, he would have been the first to
Enter Input : ridicule it. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almost
Enter Input : prided ourselves on. I don’t say that we were bad by nature, all these
Enter Input : young men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.
Enter Input : What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I
Enter Input : flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the
Enter Input : recklessness of youth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I
Enter Input : never opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and I
Enter Input : was never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book “for
Enter Input : the day and the hour, for the month and the year,” though I knew it not.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our
Enter Input : regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town
Enter Input : hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial
Enter Input : reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be
Enter Input : well off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a
Enter Input : circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble
Enter Input : and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They were
Enter Input : well-to-do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial
Enter Input : and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with
Enter Input : favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully
Enter Input : realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all,
Enter Input : but only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I could
Enter Input : not indeed have helped doing. I was prevented, however, from making her an
Enter Input : offer at the time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the
Enter Input : allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my
Enter Input : youth, and with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to my
Enter Input : feelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a time.
Enter Input : Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to another
Enter Input : district.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On my return two months later, I found the young lady already married to a
Enter Input : rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though older
Enter Input : than I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I was not,
Enter Input : and of excellent education, which I also was not. I was so overwhelmed at
Enter Input : this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded. The
Enter Input : worst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had been
Enter Input : a long while betrothed to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her
Enter Input : house, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this
Enter Input : particularly mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while
Enter Input : I knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With flushed
Enter Input : face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring my
Enter Input : love to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me, she
Enter Input : must, I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time. Later on, of
Enter Input : course, I reflected and remembered that she had been very far from
Enter Input : laughing at me; on the contrary, she used to turn off any love-making on
Enter Input : my part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects; but at that
Enter Input : moment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I
Enter Input : am surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were
Enter Input : extremely repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found
Enter Input : it difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work
Enter Input : myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my “rival” in the
Enter Input : presence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly extraneous
Enter Input : pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public event—it was in
Enter Input : the year 1826(5)—and my jeer was, so people said, clever and effective.
Enter Input : Then I forced him to ask for an explanation, and behaved so rudely that he
Enter Input : accepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us, as I was
Enter Input : younger, a person of no consequence, and of inferior rank. I learned
Enter Input : afterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also
Enter Input : that my challenge was accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his
Enter Input : wife’s account before their marriage; he fancied now that if he submitted
Enter Input : to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heard
Enter Input : of it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him. I
Enter Input : soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those days
Enter Input : though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashion
Enter Input : among the officers—so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice
Enter Input : sometimes be.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven o’clock
Enter Input : the next day on the outskirts of the town—and then something happened that
Enter Input : in very truth was the turning-point of my life. In the evening, returning
Enter Input : home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly
Enter Input : Afanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with all my might, so that it
Enter Input : was covered with blood. He had not long been in my service and I had
Enter Input : struck him before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me,
Enter Input : though it’s forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went
Enter Input : to bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was
Enter Input : breaking. I got up—I did not want to sleep any more—I went to the
Enter Input : window—opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it
Enter Input : was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the meaning of it?” I thought. “I feel in my heart as it were
Enter Input : something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,”
Enter Input : I thought, “I feel it’s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death,
Enter Input : afraid of being killed? No, that’s not it, that’s not it at all.”... And
Enter Input : all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the
Enter Input : evening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated
Enter Input : over again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face
Enter Input : and he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed
Enter Input : upon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even
Enter Input : dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been
Enter Input : brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime! It
Enter Input : was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if I
Enter Input : were struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and
Enter Input : the birds were trilling the praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands,
Enter Input : fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my
Enter Input : brother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: “My dear
Enter Input : ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your waiting
Enter Input : on me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, am I worth it?” flashed through my mind. “After all what am I worth,
Enter Input : that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and image of
Enter Input : God, should serve me?” For the first time in my life this question forced
Enter Input : itself upon me. He had said, “Mother, my little heart, in truth we are
Enter Input : each responsible to all for all, it’s only that men don’t know this. If
Enter Input : they knew it, the world would be a paradise at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God, can that too be false?” I thought as I wept. “In truth, perhaps, I
Enter Input : am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than all men
Enter Input : in the world.” And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared
Enter Input : to me; what was I going to do? I was going to kill a good, clever, noble
Enter Input : man, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his wife of happiness for
Enter Input : the rest of her life, I should be torturing and killing her too. I lay
Enter Input : thus in my bed with my face in the pillow, heedless how the time was
Enter Input : passing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch
Enter Input : me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah,” said he, “it’s a good thing you are up already, it’s time we were
Enter Input : off, come along!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out to
Enter Input : the carriage, however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait here a minute,” I said to him. “I’ll be back directly, I have
Enter Input : forgotten my purse.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And I ran back alone, to Afanasy’s little room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Afanasy,” I said, “I gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgive
Enter Input : me,” I said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw that
Enter Input : it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer’s uniform, I
Enter Input : dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me,” I said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then he was completely aghast.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his hands,
Enter Input : turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I flew out to my
Enter Input : comrade and jumped into the carriage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ready,” I cried. “Have you ever seen a conqueror?” I asked him. “Here is
Enter Input : one before you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don’t remember what
Enter Input : about.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked at me. “Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you’ll keep up
Enter Input : the honor of the uniform, I can see.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We were placed
Enter Input : twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly, looking him full
Enter Input : in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked lovingly at him, for I
Enter Input : knew what I would do. His shot just grazed my cheek and ear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank God,” I cried, “no man has been killed,” and I seized my pistol,
Enter Input : turned back and flung it far away into the wood. “That’s the place for
Enter Input : you,” I cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I turned to my adversary.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,” I said, “for my unprovoked insult
Enter Input : to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten times worse than you
Enter Input : and more, maybe. Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the
Enter Input : world.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Upon my word,” cried my adversary, annoyed, “if you did not want to
Enter Input : fight, why did not you let me alone?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,” I answered him gayly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to
Enter Input : agree with your opinion,” said he.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo,” I cried, clapping my hands. “I agree with you there too. I have
Enter Input : deserved it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Will you shoot, sir, or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I won’t,” I said; “if you like, fire at me again, but it would be
Enter Input : better for you not to fire.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: “Can you disgrace the
Enter Input : regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness! If
Enter Input : I’d only known this!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I stood facing them all, not laughing now.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen,” I said, “is it really so wonderful in these days to find a
Enter Input : man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But not in a duel,” cried my second again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what’s so strange,” I said. “For I ought to have owned my fault as
Enter Input : soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before leading him into a
Enter Input : great and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque, that to act
Enter Input : in that way would have been almost impossible, for only after I have faced
Enter Input : his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any
Enter Input : significance for him, and if I had spoken before, he would have said, ‘He
Enter Input : is a coward, the sight of the pistols has frightened him, no use to listen
Enter Input : to him.’ Gentlemen,” I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart,
Enter Input : “look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the
Enter Input : tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we,
Enter Input : are sinful and foolish, and we don’t understand that life is heaven, for
Enter Input : we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all
Enter Input : its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the sweetness
Enter Input : and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my heart as I had
Enter Input : never known before in my life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All this as rational and edifying,” said my antagonist, “and in any case
Enter Input : you are an original person.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You may laugh,” I said to him, laughing too, “but afterwards you will
Enter Input : approve of me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,” said he; “will you shake hands?
Enter Input : for I believe you are genuinely sincere.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No,” I said, “not now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserve
Enter Input : your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him. All
Enter Input : my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass
Enter Input : judgment on me the same day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has disgraced the uniform,” they said; “let him resign his
Enter Input : commission.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Some stood up for me: “He faced the shot,” they said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own pistol
Enter Input : first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into the forest.
Enter Input : No, there’s something else in this, something original.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I enjoyed listening and looking at them. “My dear friends and comrades,”
Enter Input : said I, “don’t worry about my resigning my commission, for I have done so
Enter Input : already. I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my
Enter Input : discharge I shall go into a monastery—it’s with that object I am leaving
Enter Input : the regiment.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we can’t
Enter Input : judge a monk.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but kindly
Enter Input : and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even those who had been
Enter Input : sternest in their censure, and all the following month, before my
Enter Input : discharge came, they could not make enough of me. “Ah, you monk,” they
Enter Input : would say. And every one said something kind to me, they began trying to
Enter Input : dissuade me, even to pity me: “What are you doing to yourself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No,” they would say, “he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and could have
Enter Input : fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before that he
Enter Input : should become a monk, that’s why he did it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I had been
Enter Input : kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention, and now
Enter Input : all came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me, but they
Enter Input : loved me. I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel,
Enter Input : the authorities took no notice of it, because my antagonist was a near
Enter Input : relation of our general, and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious
Enter Input : consequences, and as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And
Enter Input : I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,
Enter Input : for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations
Enter Input : mostly took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women
Enter Input : particularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But how can I possibly be responsible for all?” every one would laugh in
Enter Input : my face. “Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You may well not know it,” I would answer, “since the whole world has
Enter Input : long been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies as
Enter Input : truth and demand the same lies from others. Here I have for once in my
Enter Input : life acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman. Though
Enter Input : you are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But how can we help being friendly to you?” said my hostess, laughing.
Enter Input : The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young lady rose, on whose
Enter Input : account the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to be
Enter Input : my future wife. I had not noticed her coming into the room. She got up,
Enter Input : came to me and held out her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me tell you,” she said, “that I am the first not to laugh at you, but
Enter Input : on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you for
Enter Input : your action then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almost
Enter Input : kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was especially
Enter Input : caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others. I knew him
Enter Input : by name already, but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word
Enter Input : with him till that evening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(d) The Mysterious Visitor_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent position,
Enter Input : respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence. He subscribed
Enter Input : considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum; he was very
Enter Input : charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known after his
Enter Input : death. He was a man of about fifty, almost stern in appearance and not
Enter Input : much given to conversation. He had been married about ten years and his
Enter Input : wife, who was still young, had borne him three children. Well, I was
Enter Input : sitting alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenly
Enter Input : opened and this gentleman walked in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my former
Enter Input : quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an old
Enter Input : lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady’s servant waited upon
Enter Input : me, for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the
Enter Input : duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt ashamed to look
Enter Input : him in the face after my last interview with him. So prone is the man of
Enter Input : the world to be ashamed of any righteous action.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have,” said my visitor, “with great interest listened to you speaking
Enter Input : in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make your
Enter Input : personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately. Can you, dear
Enter Input : sir, grant me this favor?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an honor.”
Enter Input : I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I impressed
Enter Input : from the first moment by the appearance of this man. For though other
Enter Input : people had listened to me with interest and attention, no one had come to
Enter Input : me before with such a serious, stern and concentrated expression. And now
Enter Input : he had come to see me in my own rooms. He sat down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,” he said; “as you
Enter Input : have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked incurring
Enter Input : the contempt of all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,” I replied.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it’s not excessive,” he answered; “believe me, such a course of
Enter Input : action is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has
Enter Input : impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,” he
Enter Input : continued. “Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps
Enter Input : unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can recall
Enter Input : them, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the
Enter Input : duel. Do not think my question frivolous; on the contrary, I have in
Enter Input : asking the question a secret motive of my own, which I will perhaps
Enter Input : explain to you later on, if it is God’s will that we should become more
Enter Input : intimately acquainted.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into the face
Enter Input : and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on my
Enter Input : side also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my
Enter Input : opponent’s forgiveness,” I answered; “but I had better tell you from the
Enter Input : beginning what I have not yet told any one else.” And I described all that
Enter Input : had passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to the ground
Enter Input : at his feet. “From that you can see for yourself,” I concluded, “that at
Enter Input : the time of the duel it was easier for me, for I had made a beginning
Enter Input : already at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go farther
Enter Input : along it was far from being difficult, but became a source of joy and
Enter Input : happiness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. “All that,” he said, “is
Enter Input : exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And we
Enter Input : should have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of himself.
Enter Input : But about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked me
Enter Input : about myself. In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke with
Enter Input : perfect frankness to him about all my feelings; “for,” thought I, “what
Enter Input : need have I to know his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a
Enter Input : good man? Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he
Enter Input : comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.” And I
Enter Input : learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of
Enter Input : lofty mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That life is heaven,” he said to me suddenly, “that I have long been
Enter Input : thinking about”; and all at once he added, “I think of nothing else
Enter Input : indeed.” He looked at me and smiled. “I am more convinced of it than you
Enter Input : are, I will tell you later why.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me
Enter Input : something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Heaven,” he went on, “lies hidden within all of us—here it lies hidden in
Enter Input : me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all
Enter Input : time.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
Enter Input : mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins,
Enter Input : you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you could
Enter Input : comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very truth, so soon
Enter Input : as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a
Enter Input : dream, but a living reality.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And when,” I cried out to him bitterly, “when will that come to pass? and
Enter Input : will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What then, you don’t believe it,” he said. “You preach it and don’t
Enter Input : believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to
Enter Input : pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has its
Enter Input : law. It’s a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to
Enter Input : recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Until
Enter Input : you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one,
Enter Input : brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind
Enter Input : of common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges
Enter Input : with equal consideration for all. Every one will think his share too small
Enter Input : and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.
Enter Input : You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have
Enter Input : to go through the period of isolation.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by isolation?” I asked him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age—it has
Enter Input : not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one
Enter Input : strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure
Enter Input : the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his
Enter Input : efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for
Enter Input : instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All
Enter Input : mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in
Enter Input : his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has,
Enter Input : from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.
Enter Input : He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and how
Enter Input : secure,’ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps
Enter Input : up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is
Enter Input : accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the
Enter Input : whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men
Enter Input : and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and
Enter Input : the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men
Enter Input : have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to
Enter Input : be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.
Enter Input : But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will
Enter Input : suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another.
Enter Input : It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have
Enter Input : sat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the
Enter Input : Son of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keep
Enter Input : the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his
Enter Input : conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men’s
Enter Input : souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love,
Enter Input : that the great idea may not die.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and fervent
Enter Input : talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently.
Enter Input : Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as blame, for they
Enter Input : still loved me and treated me good-humoredly, but there’s no denying that
Enter Input : fashion is a great power in society. I began to regard my mysterious
Enter Input : visitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his intelligence, I began to
Enter Input : perceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart, and was
Enter Input : preparing himself perhaps for a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not
Enter Input : showing curiosity about his secret, not seeking to discover it by direct
Enter Input : question nor by insinuation. But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show
Enter Input : signs of wanting to tell me something. This had become quite evident,
Enter Input : indeed, about a month after he first began to visit me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know,” he said to me once, “that people are very inquisitive about
Enter Input : us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often. But let them
Enter Input : wonder, for _soon all will be explained_.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and almost
Enter Input : always on such occasions he would get up and go away. Sometimes he would
Enter Input : fix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, “He will say something
Enter Input : directly now.” But he would suddenly begin talking of something ordinary
Enter Input : and familiar. He often complained of headache too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking with great
Enter Input : fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his face worked
Enter Input : convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter?” I said; “do you feel ill?”—he had just been
Enter Input : complaining of headache.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. “Why is it he is
Enter Input : smiling?” The thought flashed through my mind before I realized anything
Enter Input : else. I too turned pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you saying?” I cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see,” he said, with a pale smile, “how much it has cost me to say the
Enter Input : first word. Now I have said it, I feel I’ve taken the first step and shall
Enter Input : go on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him at
Enter Input : that time, but only after he had been to see me three days running and
Enter Input : told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended by being convinced,
Enter Input : to my great grief and amazement. His crime was a great and terrible one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner, a wealthy
Enter Input : and handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He fell passionately
Enter Input : in love with her, declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry
Enter Input : him. But she had already given her heart to another man, an officer of
Enter Input : noble birth and high rank in the service, who was at that time away at the
Enter Input : front, though she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer
Enter Input : and begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to visit her,
Enter Input : he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through
Enter Input : the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often happens,
Enter Input : a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than
Enter Input : others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the ladder, knowing
Enter Input : that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the negligence of
Enter Input : the servants, left unlocked. He hoped to find it so, and so it was. He
Enter Input : made his way in the dark to her bedroom, where a light was burning. As
Enter Input : though on purpose, both her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the
Enter Input : same street, without asking leave. The other servants slept in the
Enter Input : servants’ quarters or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion
Enter Input : flamed up at the sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger
Enter Input : took possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he
Enter Input : thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then with
Enter Input : devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall on
Enter Input : the servants. He was so base as to take her purse, to open her chest with
Enter Input : keys from under her pillow, and to take some things from it, doing it all
Enter Input : as it might have been done by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers
Enter Input : and taking only money. He took some of the larger gold things, but left
Enter Input : smaller articles that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too,
Enter Input : some things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done
Enter Input : this awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after in
Enter Input : his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal. No one
Enter Input : indeed knew of his love for her, for he was always reserved and silent and
Enter Input : had no friend to whom he would have opened his heart. He was looked upon
Enter Input : simply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of the murdered
Enter Input : woman, as for the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf
Enter Input : of hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance
Enter Input : confirmed the suspicion. The man knew—indeed his mistress did not conceal
Enter Input : the fact—that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had decided
Enter Input : to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct was unsatisfactory.
Enter Input : People had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunk
Enter Input : in a tavern. Two days before her death, he had run away, staying no one
Enter Input : knew where in the town. The day after the murder, he was found on the road
Enter Input : leading out of the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his
Enter Input : right hand happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose
Enter Input : had been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that they
Enter Input : had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left open till they
Enter Input : returned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwing
Enter Input : suspicion on the innocent servant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week after the
Enter Input : arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the
Enter Input : hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and
Enter Input : every one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed
Enter Input : by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital. And after that the
Enter Input : punishment began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he was not in
Enter Input : the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable a long time,
Enter Input : but not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the woman he
Enter Input : loved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed his love,
Enter Input : while the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the innocent
Enter Input : blood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcely
Enter Input : thought. The thought that his victim might have become the wife of another
Enter Input : man was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in
Enter Input : his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness and
Enter Input : death soon set his mind at rest, for the man’s death was apparently (so he
Enter Input : reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chill
Enter Input : he had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunk
Enter Input : on the damp ground. The theft of the money and other things troubled him
Enter Input : little, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but
Enter Input : to avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards
Enter Input : subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for
Enter Input : maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his
Enter Input : conscience at rest about the theft, and it’s a remarkable fact that for a
Enter Input : long time he really was at peace—he told me this himself. He entered then
Enter Input : upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a
Enter Input : difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being a
Enter Input : man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he
Enter Input : tried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too,
Enter Input : founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good
Enter Input : deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a
Enter Input : member of philanthropic societies.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of it
Enter Input : was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl
Enter Input : and soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely
Enter Input : depression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his
Enter Input : duty to his wife and children, he would escape from old memories
Enter Input : altogether. But the very opposite of what he expected happened. He began,
Enter Input : even in the first month of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the
Enter Input : thought, “My wife loves me—but what if she knew?” When she first told him
Enter Input : that she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. “I am giving life,
Enter Input : but I have taken life.” Children came. “How dare I love them, teach and
Enter Input : educate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have shed blood.” They
Enter Input : were splendid children, he longed to caress them; “and I can’t look at
Enter Input : their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his
Enter Input : murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood that
Enter Input : cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have awful dreams. But, being a
Enter Input : man of fortitude, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking: “I shall
Enter Input : expiate everything by this secret agony.” But that hope, too, was vain;
Enter Input : the longer it went on, the more intense was his suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though every one
Enter Input : was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the more he was
Enter Input : respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He confessed to me that he
Enter Input : had thoughts of killing himself. But he began to be haunted by another
Enter Input : idea—an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable,
Enter Input : though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it
Enter Input : off. He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all
Enter Input : men that he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued
Enter Input : him, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his whole
Enter Input : heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would be
Enter Input : at peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with terror, for how
Enter Input : could he carry it out? And then came what happened at my duel.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Looking at you, I have made up my mind.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I looked at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it possible,” I cried, clasping my hands, “that such a trivial
Enter Input : incident could give rise to such a resolution in you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My resolution has been growing for the last three years,” he answered,
Enter Input : “and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking at you, I
Enter Input : reproached myself and envied you.” He said this to me almost sullenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you won’t be believed,” I observed; “it’s fourteen years ago.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then I cried and kissed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me one thing, one thing,” he said (as though it all depended upon
Enter Input : me), “my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, and though my
Enter Input : children won’t lose their rank and property, they’ll be a convict’s
Enter Input : children and for ever! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall
Enter Input : leave in their hearts!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I said nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It’s for ever, you know,
Enter Input : for ever!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt afraid.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well?” He looked at me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go!” said I, “confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Your
Enter Input : children will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of your
Enter Input : resolution.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for more than
Enter Input : a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still preparing
Enter Input : himself, still unable to bring himself to the point. He made my heart
Enter Input : ache. One day he would come determined and say fervently:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess. Fourteen
Enter Input : years I’ve been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my punishment and
Enter Input : begin to live. You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there’s no
Enter Input : turning back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children.
Enter Input : Good God, my children will understand, perhaps, what my punishment has
Enter Input : cost me and will not condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All will understand your sacrifice,” I said to him, “if not at once, they
Enter Input : will understand later; for you have served truth, the higher truth, not of
Enter Input : the earth.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would come again,
Enter Input : bitter, pale, sarcastic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though to
Enter Input : say, ‘He has still not confessed!’ Wait a bit, don’t despise me too much.
Enter Input : It’s not such an easy thing to do, as you would think. Perhaps I shall not
Enter Input : do it at all. You won’t go and inform against me then, will you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid to
Enter Input : look at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full of
Enter Input : tears. I could not sleep at night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have just come from my wife,” he went on. “Do you understand what the
Enter Input : word ‘wife’ means? When I went out, the children called to me, ‘Good-by,
Enter Input : father, make haste back to read _The Children’s Magazine_ with us.’ No,
Enter Input : you don’t understand that! No one is wise from another man’s woe.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he struck the
Enter Input : table with his fist so that everything on it danced—it was the first time
Enter Input : he had done such a thing, he was such a mild man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But need I?” he exclaimed, “must I? No one has been condemned, no one has
Enter Input : been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever. And I’ve been
Enter Input : punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shan’t be believed,
Enter Input : they won’t believe my proofs. Need I confess, need I? I am ready to go on
Enter Input : suffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only my wife and
Enter Input : children may be spared. Will it be just to ruin them with me? Aren’t we
Enter Input : making a mistake? What is right in this case? And will people recognize
Enter Input : it, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good Lord!” I thought to myself, “he is thinking of other people’s
Enter Input : respect at such a moment!” And I felt so sorry for him then, that I
Enter Input : believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him. I saw
Enter Input : he was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as well as my
Enter Input : mind what such a resolution meant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Decide my fate!” he exclaimed again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go and confess,” I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I whispered
Enter Input : it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table, the Russian
Enter Input : translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John, chapter xii. verse 24:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the
Enter Input : ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
Enter Input : fruit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true,” he said, but he smiled bitterly. “It’s terrible the things
Enter Input : you find in those books,” he said, after a pause. “It’s easy enough to
Enter Input : thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have been written by
Enter Input : men?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Holy Spirit wrote them,” said I.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s easy for you to prate,” he smiled again, this time almost with
Enter Input : hatred.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him the
Enter Input : Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An awful text,” he said. “There’s no denying you’ve picked out fitting
Enter Input : ones.” He rose from the chair. “Well!” he said, “good-by, perhaps I shan’t
Enter Input : come again ... we shall meet in heaven. So I have been for fourteen years
Enter Input : ‘in the hands of the living God,’ that’s how one must think of those
Enter Input : fourteen years. To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dare—his face
Enter Input : was contorted and somber. He went away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good God,” I thought, “what has he gone to face!” I fell on my knees
Enter Input : before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God, our swift
Enter Input : defender and helper. I was half an hour praying in tears, and it was late,
Enter Input : about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again. I was
Enter Input : surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where have you been?” I asked him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I think,” he said, “I’ve forgotten something ... my handkerchief, I
Enter Input : think.... Well, even if I’ve not forgotten anything, let me stay a
Enter Input : little.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down. I stood over him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You sit down, too,” said he.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at me and
Enter Input : suddenly smiled—I remembered that—then he got up, embraced me warmly and
Enter Input : kissed me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Remember,” he said, “how I came to you a second time. Do you hear,
Enter Input : remember it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To-morrow,” I thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was his
Enter Input : birthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance of
Enter Input : hearing it from any one. On that day he always had a great gathering,
Enter Input : every one in the town went to it. It was the same this time. After dinner
Enter Input : he walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his hand—a formal
Enter Input : declaration to the chief of his department who was present. This
Enter Input : declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly. It contained a full
Enter Input : account of the crime, in every detail.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,” he said in
Enter Input : conclusion. “I want to suffer for my sin!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been
Enter Input : keeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his crime, the
Enter Input : jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert
Enter Input : suspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her
Enter Input : betrothed in the locket, her notebook and two letters; one from her
Enter Input : betrothed, telling her that he would soon be with her, and her unfinished
Enter Input : answer left on the table to be sent off next day. He carried off these two
Enter Input : letters—what for? Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards
Enter Input : instead of destroying them as evidence against him?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every one
Enter Input : refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged, though all
Enter Input : listened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was fully decided and
Enter Input : agreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal authorities
Enter Input : could not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped it. Though the
Enter Input : trinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that even if they did
Enter Input : turn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on those alone.
Enter Input : Besides, she might have given him those things as a friend, or asked him
Enter Input : to take care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that the
Enter Input : genuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the
Enter Input : murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet nothing was
Enter Input : destined to come of it, after all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Five days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was in
Enter Input : danger. The nature of his illness I can’t explain, they said it was an
Enter Input : affection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors had been
Enter Input : induced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also, and had come
Enter Input : to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity. I betrayed nothing,
Enter Input : though people ran to question me. But when I wanted to visit him, I was
Enter Input : for a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his wife.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s you who have caused his illness,” she said to me; “he was always
Enter Input : gloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarly
Enter Input : excited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him.
Enter Input : Your preaching has brought him to this; for the last month he was always
Enter Input : with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Indeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamed
Enter Input : me. “It’s all your doing,” they said. I was silent and indeed rejoiced at
Enter Input : heart, for I saw plainly God’s mercy to the man who had turned against
Enter Input : himself and punished himself. I could not believe in his insanity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good-by to me. I went
Enter Input : in to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but his hours were
Enter Input : numbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for breath,
Enter Input : but his face was full of tender and happy feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is done!” he said. “I’ve long been yearning to see you, why didn’t you
Enter Input : come?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I did not tell him that they would not let me see him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying,
Enter Input : but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years. There was
Enter Input : heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dare
Enter Input : to love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife nor the judges, nor
Enter Input : any one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I see
Enter Input : in that God’s mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without a
Enter Input : stain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heaven
Enter Input : ... I have done my duty.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly,
Enter Input : looking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept peeping
Enter Input : in at us. But he had time to whisper to me:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? I
Enter Input : told you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to kill
Enter Input : you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I started.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets,
Enter Input : struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly
Enter Input : bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he is my judge. I
Enter Input : can’t refuse to face my punishment to-morrow, for he knows all. It was not
Enter Input : that I was afraid you would betray me (I never even thought of that), but
Enter Input : I thought, ‘How can I look him in the face if I don’t confess?’ And if you
Enter Input : had been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all
Enter Input : the same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing
Enter Input : everything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the cause, as
Enter Input : though you were to blame for everything. I came back to you then,
Enter Input : remembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I sat down and
Enter Input : asked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I pondered. If I had killed
Enter Input : you, I should have been ruined by that murder even if I had not confessed
Enter Input : the other. But I didn’t think about that at all, and I didn’t want to
Enter Input : think of it at that moment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myself
Enter Input : on you for everything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let
Enter Input : me tell you, you were never nearer death.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave. The chief
Enter Input : priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible illness
Enter Input : that had cut short his days. But all the town was up in arms against me
Enter Input : after the funeral, and people even refused to see me. Some, at first a few
Enter Input : and afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the truth of his story,
Enter Input : and they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness,
Enter Input : for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But I
Enter Input : held my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months
Enter Input : later by God’s grace I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praising
Enter Input : the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember in
Enter Input : my prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered so
Enter Input : greatly.

Enter Input : Chapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossima
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world the word
Enter Input : is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others it is
Enter Input : used as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is growing. It is
Enter Input : true, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards, gluttons,
Enter Input : profligates and insolent beggars among monks. Educated people point to
Enter Input : these: “You are idlers, useless members of society, you live on the labor
Enter Input : of others, you are shameless beggars.” And yet how many meek and humble
Enter Input : monks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! These
Enter Input : are less noticed, or passed over in silence. And how surprised men would
Enter Input : be if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary
Enter Input : prayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more! For they are
Enter Input : in truth made ready in peace and quiet “for the day and the hour, the
Enter Input : month and the year.” Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image of
Enter Input : Christ fair and undefiled, in the purity of God’s truth, from the times of
Enter Input : the Fathers of old, the Apostles and the martyrs. And when the time comes
Enter Input : they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world. That is a great
Enter Input : thought. That star will rise out of the East.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at the
Enter Input : worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has not
Enter Input : God’s image and His truth been distorted in them? They have science; but
Enter Input : in science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. The spiritual
Enter Input : world, the higher part of man’s being is rejected altogether, dismissed
Enter Input : with a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The world has proclaimed the
Enter Input : reign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom
Enter Input : of theirs? Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the
Enter Input : most rich and powerful. Don’t be afraid of satisfying them and even
Enter Input : multiply your desires.” That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that
Enter Input : they see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication of
Enter Input : desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy
Enter Input : and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the
Enter Input : means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting
Enter Input : more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community,
Enter Input : as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom as the
Enter Input : multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their own
Enter Input : nature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous
Enter Input : fancies are fostered in them. They live only for mutual envy, for luxury
Enter Input : and ostentation. To have dinners, visits, carriages, rank and slaves to
Enter Input : wait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which life, honor and human
Enter Input : feeling are sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable to
Enter Input : satisfy it. We see the same thing among those who are not rich, while the
Enter Input : poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness. But soon
Enter Input : they will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to it. I ask
Enter Input : you is such a man free? I knew one “champion of freedom” who told me
Enter Input : himself that, when he was deprived of tobacco in prison, he was so
Enter Input : wretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for
Enter Input : the sake of getting tobacco again! And such a man says, “I am fighting for
Enter Input : the cause of humanity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : How can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps of
Enter Input : some action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And it’s no wonder
Enter Input : that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and instead
Enter Input : of serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have
Enter Input : fallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation, as my mysterious
Enter Input : visitor and teacher said to me in my youth. And therefore the idea of the
Enter Input : service of humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is
Enter Input : more and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes
Enter Input : treated with derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What can
Enter Input : become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the
Enter Input : innumerable desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and what
Enter Input : concern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in
Enter Input : accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown
Enter Input : less.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer are
Enter Input : laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom. I
Enter Input : cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and
Enter Input : wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God’s help I attain
Enter Input : freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most capable of
Enter Input : conceiving a great idea and serving it—the rich man in his isolation or
Enter Input : the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and
Enter Input : habits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, “You have secluded
Enter Input : yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, and
Enter Input : have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!” But we shall see which
Enter Input : will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but
Enter Input : they, who are in isolation, though they don’t see that. Of old, leaders of
Enter Input : the people came from among us, and why should they not again? The same
Enter Input : meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great
Enter Input : cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people. And the Russian monk
Enter Input : has always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if the
Enter Input : people are isolated. The people believe as we do, and an unbelieving
Enter Input : reformer will never do anything in Russia, even if he is sincere in heart
Enter Input : and a genius. Remember that! The people will meet the atheist and overcome
Enter Input : him, and Russia will be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and
Enter Input : guard his heart. Go on educating him quietly. That’s your duty as monks,
Enter Input : for the peasant has God in his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (_f_) _Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them to
Enter Input : be Brothers in the Spirit_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Of course, I don’t deny that there is sin in the peasants too. And the
Enter Input : fire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from above
Enter Input : downwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.
Enter Input : Money-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. Already the
Enter Input : merchant grows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show himself
Enter Input : cultured though he has not a trace of culture, and to this end meanly
Enter Input : despises his old traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of his
Enter Input : fathers. He visits princes, though he is only a peasant corrupted. The
Enter Input : peasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit. And
Enter Input : what cruelty to their wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness!
Enter Input : I’ve seen in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety,
Enter Input : bent and already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, work
Enter Input : all day long, the vile language and the drink, the drink—is that what a
Enter Input : little child’s heart needs? He needs sunshine, childish play, good
Enter Input : examples all about him, and at least a little love. There must be no more
Enter Input : of this, monks, no more torturing of children, rise up and preach that,
Enter Input : make haste, make haste!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and cannot
Enter Input : renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and that they
Enter Input : do wrong in sinning. So that our people still believe in righteousness,
Enter Input : have faith in God and weep tears of devotion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It is different with the upper classes. They, following science, want to
Enter Input : base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and they
Enter Input : have already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no sin. And
Enter Input : that’s consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning of crime? In
Enter Input : Europe the people are already rising up against the rich with violence,
Enter Input : and the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed,
Enter Input : and teaching them that their wrath is righteous. But their “wrath is
Enter Input : accursed, for it is cruel.” But God will save Russia as He has saved her
Enter Input : many times. Salvation will come from the people, from their faith and
Enter Input : their meekness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, watch over the people’s faith and this will not be a
Enter Input : dream. I’ve been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity,
Enter Input : their true and seemly dignity. I’ve seen it myself, I can testify to it,
Enter Input : I’ve seen it and marveled at it, I’ve seen it in spite of the degraded
Enter Input : sins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry. They are not
Enter Input : servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner
Enter Input : and bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.
Enter Input : “You are rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, God
Enter Input : bless you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact
Enter Input : that I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In truth if they don’t say this (for they don’t know how to say this yet),
Enter Input : that is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known it myself, and,
Enter Input : would you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is, the more
Enter Input : noticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them are for the
Enter Input : most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness
Enter Input : and indifference. But God will save His people, for Russia is great in her
Enter Input : humility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future.
Enter Input : It will come to pass, that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by
Enter Input : being ashamed of his riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his
Enter Input : humility, will understand and give way before him, will respond joyfully
Enter Input : and kindly to his honorable shame. Believe me that it will end in that;
Enter Input : things are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritual
Enter Input : dignity of man, and that will only be understood among us. If we were
Enter Input : brothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will never
Enter Input : agree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and
Enter Input : it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world. So may it
Enter Input : be, so may it be!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my wanderings
Enter Input : I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was eight years since
Enter Input : I had parted from him. He chanced to see me in the market-place,
Enter Input : recognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he was! He simply pounced
Enter Input : on me: “Master dear, is it you? Is it really you I see?” He took me home
Enter Input : with him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two little
Enter Input : children. He and his wife earned their living as costermongers in the
Enter Input : market-place. His room was poor, but bright and clean. He made me sit
Enter Input : down, set the samovar, sent for his wife, as though my appearance were a
Enter Input : festival for them. He brought me his children: “Bless them, Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will pray for
Enter Input : them. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since that
Enter Input : day, for it all came from you,” said I. And I explained that to him as
Enter Input : well as I could. And what do you think? The man kept gazing at me and
Enter Input : could not believe that I, his former master, an officer, was now before
Enter Input : him in such a guise and position; it made him shed tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you weeping?” said I, “better rejoice over me, dear friend, whom
Enter Input : I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over me
Enter Input : tenderly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What has became of your fortune?” he asked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I gave it to the monastery,” I answered; “we live in common.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he brought out half a
Enter Input : rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble I saw him
Enter Input : thrusting hurriedly into my hand: “That’s for you in your wanderings, it
Enter Input : may be of use to you, Father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out rejoicing.
Enter Input : And on my way I thought: “Here we are both now, he at home and I on the
Enter Input : road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet smiling joyfully in
Enter Input : the gladness of our hearts, remembering how God brought about our
Enter Input : meeting.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have never seen him again since then. I had been his master and he my
Enter Input : servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts,
Enter Input : there was a great human bond between us. I have thought a great deal about
Enter Input : that, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that that grand
Enter Input : and simple-hearted unity might in due time become universal among the
Enter Input : Russian people? I believe that it will come to pass and that the time is
Enter Input : at hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I was often
Enter Input : angry with servants; “the cook had served something too hot, the orderly
Enter Input : had not brushed my clothes.” But what taught me better then was a thought
Enter Input : of my dear brother’s, which I had heard from him in childhood: “Am I worth
Enter Input : it, that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty
Enter Input : and ignorance?” And I wondered at the time that such simple and
Enter Input : self-evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act so
Enter Input : that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant.
Enter Input : And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him see it, and
Enter Input : that without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his? Why should not
Enter Input : my servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take him into my family
Enter Input : and rejoice in doing so? Even now this can be done, but it will lead to
Enter Input : the grand unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servants
Enter Input : for himself, or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he
Enter Input : does now, but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the
Enter Input : servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only in deeds
Enter Input : of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in gluttony,
Enter Input : fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one with the
Enter Input : other? I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand.
Enter Input : People laugh and ask: “When will that time come and does it look like
Enter Input : coming?” I believe that with Christ’s help we shall accomplish this great
Enter Input : thing. And how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man
Enter Input : which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when their
Enter Input : destined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth.
Enter Input : So it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, and
Enter Input : all men will say: “The stone which the builders rejected has become the
Enter Input : corner-stone of the building.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when will
Enter Input : you build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone,
Enter Input : without Christ? If they declare that it is they who are advancing towards
Enter Input : unity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one may
Enter Input : positively marvel at such simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic
Enter Input : dreams than we. They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by
Enter Input : flooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that
Enter Input : taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not for
Enter Input : Christ’s covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last two
Enter Input : men on earth. And those two last men would not be able to restrain each
Enter Input : other in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself.
Enter Input : And that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that
Enter Input : for the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : While I was still wearing an officer’s uniform after my duel, I talked
Enter Input : about servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed at
Enter Input : me. “What!” they asked, “are we to make our servants sit down on the sofa
Enter Input : and offer them tea?” And I answered them: “Why not, sometimes at least?”
Enter Input : Every one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer was not
Enter Input : clear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (_g_) _Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Young man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer
Enter Input : is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will
Enter Input : give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an
Enter Input : education. Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to
Enter Input : yourself, “Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to-day.” For
Enter Input : every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and
Enter Input : their souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude,
Enter Input : unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether
Enter Input : they have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth
Enter Input : perhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew
Enter Input : them not nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread
Enter Input : before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one to
Enter Input : pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! And
Enter Input : God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much
Enter Input : pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving and
Enter Input : merciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Brothers, have no fear of men’s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for that
Enter Input : is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all
Enter Input : God’s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf,
Enter Input : every ray of God’s light. Love the animals, love the plants, love
Enter Input : everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery
Enter Input : in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better
Enter Input : every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an
Enter Input : all-embracing love. Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of
Enter Input : thought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble it, don’t harass them, don’t
Enter Input : deprive them of their happiness, don’t work against God’s intent. Man, do
Enter Input : not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin,
Enter Input : and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it,
Enter Input : and leave the traces of your foulness after you—alas, it is true of almost
Enter Input : every one of us! Love children especially, for they too are sinless like
Enter Input : the angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to
Enter Input : guide us. Woe to him who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love
Enter Input : children. The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the
Enter Input : farthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could not pass
Enter Input : by a child without emotion. That’s the nature of the man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men’s
Enter Input : sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Always
Enter Input : decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may
Enter Input : subdue the whole world. Loving humility is marvelously strong, the
Enter Input : strongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watch
Enter Input : yourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass by a little
Enter Input : child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you
Enter Input : may not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image,
Enter Input : unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You don’t know
Enter Input : it, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and all
Enter Input : because you were not careful before the child, because you did not foster
Enter Input : in yourself a careful, actively benevolent love. Brothers, love is a
Enter Input : teacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire,
Enter Input : it is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor. For we must love not
Enter Input : only occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one can love
Enter Input : occasionally, even the wicked can.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : My brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless, but it
Enter Input : is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch
Enter Input : in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It may be
Enter Input : senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier at
Enter Input : your side—a little happier, anyway—and children and all animals, if you
Enter Input : were nobler than you are now. It’s all like an ocean, I tell you. Then you
Enter Input : would pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in a sort
Enter Input : of transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your sin. Treasure
Enter Input : this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : My friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds of
Enter Input : heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear not
Enter Input : that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. Do not
Enter Input : say, “Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, and
Enter Input : we are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away and
Enter Input : hindering our good work from being done.” Fly from that dejection,
Enter Input : children! There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and
Enter Input : make yourself responsible for all men’s sins, that is the truth, you know,
Enter Input : friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for
Enter Input : everything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and
Enter Input : that you are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing your
Enter Input : own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of
Enter Input : Satan and murmuring against God.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth to
Enter Input : comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to share
Enter Input : it, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine. Indeed,
Enter Input : many of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we cannot
Enter Input : comprehend on earth. Let not that be a stumbling-block, and think not that
Enter Input : it may serve as a justification to you for anything. For the Eternal Judge
Enter Input : asks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will know
Enter Input : that yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then and
Enter Input : will not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and if
Enter Input : it were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should be
Enter Input : undone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the flood. Much
Enter Input : on earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that we have been given a
Enter Input : precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world, with the
Enter Input : higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are not
Enter Input : here but in other worlds. That is why the philosophers say that we cannot
Enter Input : apprehend the reality of things on earth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and His
Enter Input : garden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what grows
Enter Input : lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other
Enter Input : mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you, the
Enter Input : heavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be indifferent to life
Enter Input : and even grow to hate it. That’s what I think.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one. For no one
Enter Input : can judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just such a criminal
Enter Input : as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more than all men
Enter Input : to blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will be able to be a
Enter Input : judge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous
Enter Input : myself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me. If
Enter Input : you can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is
Enter Input : judging, take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go without
Enter Input : reproach. And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same
Enter Input : spirit so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more
Enter Input : bitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched,
Enter Input : mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows his
Enter Input : time has not yet come, but it will come in due course. And if it come not,
Enter Input : no matter; if not he, then another in his place will understand and
Enter Input : suffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled.
Enter Input : Believe that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and
Enter Input : faith of the saints.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Work without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to sleep, “I
Enter Input : have not done what I ought to have done,” rise up at once and do it. If
Enter Input : the people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you, fall
Enter Input : down before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you are to blame
Enter Input : for their not wanting to hear you. And if you cannot speak to them in
Enter Input : their bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility, never losing
Enter Input : hope. If all men abandon you and even drive you away by force, then when
Enter Input : you are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears
Enter Input : and it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in
Enter Input : your solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you
Enter Input : were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise
Enter Input : God in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered together—then there
Enter Input : is a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace each other tenderly and
Enter Input : praise God, for if only in you two His truth has been fulfilled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : If you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for your
Enter Input : sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous man,
Enter Input : rejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not sinned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming
Enter Input : distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above all
Enter Input : things that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as though
Enter Input : you were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering and bear it
Enter Input : and your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too are
Enter Input : guilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one
Enter Input : man sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light,
Enter Input : you would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might
Enter Input : perhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though your
Enter Input : light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm and
Enter Input : doubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they were not
Enter Input : saved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter,
Enter Input : then their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when you
Enter Input : are dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains. Men are always
Enter Input : saved after the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay
Enter Input : them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.
Enter Input : You are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek no
Enter Input : reward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which is
Enter Input : only vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great nor the mighty,
Enter Input : but be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know the times, study that.
Enter Input : When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth and
Enter Input : kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love.
Enter Input : Love all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water the
Enter Input : earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don’t be ashamed of
Enter Input : that ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not
Enter Input : given to many but only to the elect.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : _(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fathers and teachers, I ponder, “What is hell?” I maintain that it is the
Enter Input : suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,
Enter Input : immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his
Enter Input : coming to earth, the power of saying, “I am and I love.” Once, only once,
Enter Input : there was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for that was
Enter Input : earthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And that happy
Enter Input : creature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned
Enter Input : it and remained callous. Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham’s
Enter Input : bosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man
Enter Input : and Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is
Enter Input : just his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be
Enter Input : brought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. For
Enter Input : he sees clearly and says to himself, “Now I have understanding, and though
Enter Input : I now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my
Enter Input : love, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with a
Enter Input : drop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the
Enter Input : fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it
Enter Input : on earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Even
Enter Input : though I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for that
Enter Input : life is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is a gulf
Enter Input : fixed between that life and this existence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don’t go into that mystery
Enter Input : and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, they
Enter Input : would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still
Enter Input : greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that
Enter Input : spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not
Enter Input : external but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it
Enter Input : would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the
Enter Input : righteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called
Enter Input : them up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their
Enter Input : torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst
Enter Input : for responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible. In the
Enter Input : timidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of this
Enter Input : impossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting the love
Enter Input : of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it, by this
Enter Input : submissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will attain at last,
Enter Input : as it were, to a certain semblance of that active love which they scorned
Enter Input : in life, to something like its outward expression.... I am sorry, friends
Enter Input : and brothers, that I cannot express this clearly. But woe to those who
Enter Input : have slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that there
Enter Input : can be none more miserable then they. They tell us that it is a sin to
Enter Input : pray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were, renounces them, but in
Enter Input : my secret heart I believe that we may pray even for them. Love can never
Enter Input : be an offense to Christ. For such as those I have prayed inwardly all my
Enter Input : life, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray for them
Enter Input : every day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite of
Enter Input : their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there are
Enter Input : some fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his proud
Enter Input : spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they are
Enter Input : tortured by their own choice. For they have cursed themselves, cursing God
Enter Input : and life. They live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in the
Enter Input : desert sucking blood out of his own body. But they are never satisfied,
Enter Input : and they refuse forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannot
Enter Input : behold the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of
Enter Input : life should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His own
Enter Input : creation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and
Enter Input : yearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain to death....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :                   -------------------------------------
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov’s manuscript ends. I repeat, it is
Enter Input : incomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover only
Enter Input : Father Zossima’s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we find
Enter Input : brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions.
Enter Input : His utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from
Enter Input : the rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch’s manuscript.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder’s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although those
Enter Input : who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was
Enter Input : approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so
Enter Input : suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing him
Enter Input : that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there
Enter Input : was at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five
Enter Input : minutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was
Enter Input : impossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his
Enter Input : chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from
Enter Input : their seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at
Enter Input : them with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed
Enter Input : his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful
Enter Input : ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his
Enter Input : soul to God.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the
Enter Input : monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was
Enter Input : from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient
Enter Input : ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn
Enter Input : the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was
Enter Input : talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the
Enter Input : monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only
Enter Input : add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so
Enter Input : strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the
Enter Input : townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is
Enter Input : still vividly remembered in the town.

Enter Input : PART III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book VII. Alyosha
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the
Enter Input : established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits
Enter Input : are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: “If any one of the
Enter Input : monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it
Enter Input : is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the
Enter Input : cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the
Enter Input : hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.” All this was done by
Enter Input : Father Païssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and
Enter Input : wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to
Enter Input : allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head he
Enter Input : put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and the
Enter Input : dead man’s face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was put an ikon
Enter Input : of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been
Enter Input : made ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the
Enter Input : cell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors
Enter Input : and fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest
Enter Input : rule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks
Enter Input : in holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after
Enter Input : the requiem service. Father Païssy desired later on to read the Gospel all
Enter Input : day and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the
Enter Input : Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for
Enter Input : something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even “unseemly” excitement and
Enter Input : impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitors
Enter Input : from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the
Enter Input : town. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked. Both the
Enter Input : Superintendent and Father Païssy did their utmost to calm the general
Enter Input : bustle and agitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in most
Enter Input : cases children, with them from the town—as though they had been waiting
Enter Input : expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the dead
Enter Input : elder’s remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately made
Enter Input : manifest in accordance with their faith. It was only then apparent how
Enter Input : unquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima during
Enter Input : his lifetime as a great saint. And those who came were far from being all
Enter Input : of the humbler classes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such
Enter Input : haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,
Enter Input : impressed Father Païssy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen something
Enter Input : of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything
Enter Input : he had looked for. When he came across any of the monks who displayed this
Enter Input : excitement, Father Païssy began to reprove them. “Such immediate
Enter Input : expectation of something extraordinary,” he said, “shows a levity,
Enter Input : possible to worldly people but unseemly in us.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But little attention was paid him and Father Païssy noticed it uneasily.
Enter Input : Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at the bottom
Enter Input : of his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware
Enter Input : of it, though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation around
Enter Input : him, and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it was
Enter Input : particularly unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presence
Enter Input : aroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead man’s cell he
Enter Input : noticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached himself)
Enter Input : the presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still
Enter Input : staying in the monastery. Of both of them Father Païssy felt for some
Enter Input : reason suddenly suspicious—though, indeed, he might well have felt the
Enter Input : same about others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited
Enter Input : crowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking questions,
Enter Input : everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was whispering with a
Enter Input : peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest impatience
Enter Input : and even a sort of irritation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitage
Enter Input : at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that good-hearted
Enter Input : but weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to the
Enter Input : hermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she was
Enter Input : overtaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitin
Enter Input : to the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter
Enter Input : every half-hour or so “_everything that takes place_.” She regarded
Enter Input : Rakitin as a most religious and devout young man. He was particularly
Enter Input : clever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most
Enter Input : to their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from
Enter Input : doing so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging about
Enter Input : the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scattered
Enter Input : here and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the hermitage,
Enter Input : Father Païssy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen him for some
Enter Input : time, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of him than he at
Enter Input : once noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting
Enter Input : on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his
Enter Input : saintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to the
Enter Input : wall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him,
Enter Input : Father Païssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face
Enter Input : hidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs.
Enter Input : Father Païssy stood over him for a little.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Enough, dear son, enough, dear,” he pronounced with feeling at last. “Why
Enter Input : do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don’t you know that this is the
Enter Input : greatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with crying
Enter Input : like a child’s, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid
Enter Input : his face in his hands again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Maybe it is well,” said Father Païssy thoughtfully; “weep if you must,
Enter Input : Christ has sent you those tears.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to
Enter Input : gladden your dear heart,” he added to himself, walking away from Alyosha,
Enter Input : and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however, for he felt
Enter Input : that he too might weep looking at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems
Enter Input : for the dead followed in their due course. Father Païssy again took Father
Enter Input : Iosif’s place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But before three
Enter Input : o’clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at
Enter Input : the end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so
Enter Input : contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has
Enter Input : been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding
Enter Input : neighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost
Enter Input : repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and
Enter Input : was such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the most
Enter Input : natural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mention
Enter Input : of it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the
Enter Input : heart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha,
Enter Input : forming a crisis and turning-point in his spiritual development, giving a
Enter Input : shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his
Enter Input : life and gave it a definite aim.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father
Enter Input : Zossima’s body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the
Enter Input : question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the
Enter Input : coffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and
Enter Input : almost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed
Enter Input : it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the
Enter Input : body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if
Enter Input : not a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For they
Enter Input : expected something quite different.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first
Enter Input : only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently
Enter Input : each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o’clock
Enter Input : those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly
Enter Input : reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated
Enter Input : to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in
Enter Input : the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it,
Enter Input : believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the
Enter Input : believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for “men
Enter Input : love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,” as the deceased elder
Enter Input : had said in one of his exhortations.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin,
Enter Input : growing gradually more marked, and by three o’clock it was quite
Enter Input : unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal
Enter Input : could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have
Enter Input : been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after
Enter Input : this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many
Enter Input : years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they
Enter Input : recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions.
Enter Input : For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men,
Enter Input : whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins,
Enter Input : too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead
Enter Input : bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.
Enter Input : Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose
Enter Input : memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition,
Enter Input : showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as
Enter Input : touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as
Enter Input : something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God’s grace, of
Enter Input : still greater glory from their tombs in the future.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job,
Enter Input : who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had
Enter Input : been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was
Enter Input : pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and
Enter Input : mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb
Enter Input : on which Father Païssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another
Enter Input : memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy,
Enter Input : who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the
Enter Input : eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all
Enter Input : the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these
Enter Input : had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of
Enter Input : decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light
Enter Input : in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came
Enter Input : from their bodies.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain
Enter Input : the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin
Enter Input : of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes
Enter Input : were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostility
Enter Input : to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy
Enter Input : hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was
Enter Input : jealousy of the dead man’s saintliness, so firmly established during his
Enter Input : lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though
Enter Input : the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles,
Enter Input : and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in
Enter Input : fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so had
Enter Input : come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery
Enter Input : but in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but “Why do they
Enter Input : think him so saintly?” And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave
Enter Input : rise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was
Enter Input : why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition
Enter Input : which came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the
Enter Input : same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently
Enter Input : devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted
Enter Input : by this incident. This was how the thing happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of
Enter Input : the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They went
Enter Input : in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the
Enter Input : crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook their heads
Enter Input : mournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight which
Enter Input : gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no one reproached
Enter Input : them for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for
Enter Input : the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it
Enter Input : seemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand
Enter Input : for a time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went into
Enter Input : the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went into
Enter Input : the cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage.
Enter Input : After three o’clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and
Enter Input : this was no doubt owing to the shocking news. People were attracted who
Enter Input : would not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come,
Enter Input : and among them were some personages of high standing. But external decorum
Enter Input : was still preserved and Father Païssy, with a stern face, continued firmly
Enter Input : and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what was
Enter Input : taking place around him, though he had, in fact, observed something
Enter Input : unusual long before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually
Enter Input : louder and more confident, reached even him. “It shows God’s judgment is
Enter Input : not as man’s,” Father Païssy heard suddenly. The first to give utterance
Enter Input : to this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known
Enter Input : to be a man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had
Enter Input : long been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning
Enter Input : conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction
Enter Input : at that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon they
Enter Input : began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they
Enter Input : had a sort of right to discard it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And for what reason can _this_ have happened,” some of the monks said, at
Enter Input : first with a show of regret; “he had a small frame and his flesh was dried
Enter Input : up on his bones, what was there to decay?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be a sign from heaven,” others hastened to add, and their opinion
Enter Input : was adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out, too, that if
Enter Input : the decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner,
Enter Input : it would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-four
Enter Input : hours, but this premature corruption “was in excess of nature,” and so the
Enter Input : finger of God was evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed
Enter Input : irresistible.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man’s,
Enter Input : tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that “this is not held
Enter Input : everywhere alike,” and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just
Enter Input : was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that even
Enter Input : in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatly
Enter Input : confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of the
Enter Input : glorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the color
Enter Input : of the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have
Enter Input : decayed in it. “And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign
Enter Input : that the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but
Enter Input : black, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such glory—that is
Enter Input : the belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has been
Enter Input : preserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,” said Father
Enter Input : Iosif in conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the meek Father’s words had little effect and even provoked a mocking
Enter Input : retort. “That’s all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,” the
Enter Input : monks decided. “We stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts of
Enter Input : innovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?” added others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the
Enter Input : Turks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been impure
Enter Input : and they have no bells even,” the most sneering added.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward his
Enter Input : own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it
Enter Input : himself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was
Enter Input : beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little by
Enter Input : little, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif.
Enter Input : And so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with
Enter Input : devout obedience the institution of the eldership were all at once
Enter Input : terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another’s faces, when they
Enter Input : met. Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty,
Enter Input : held up their heads proudly. “There was no smell of corruption from the
Enter Input : late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,” they recalled malignantly.
Enter Input : “But he gained that glory not because he was an elder, but because he was
Enter Input : a holy man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father
Enter Input : Zossima. “His teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy and
Enter Input : not a vale of tears,” said some of the more unreasonable. “He followed the
Enter Input : fashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in hell,” others,
Enter Input : still more unreasonable, added. “He was not strict in fasting, allowed
Enter Input : himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send it
Enter Input : to him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?” could be heard
Enter Input : among some of the envious. “He sat in pride,” the most malignant declared
Enter Input : vindictively; “he considered himself a saint and he took it as his due
Enter Input : when people knelt before him.” “He abused the sacrament of confession,”
Enter Input : the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious
Enter Input : whisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in their
Enter Input : devotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the
Enter Input : deceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was
Enter Input : terrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were not
Enter Input : yet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this
Enter Input : attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. “Yes, clearly Father
Enter Input : Ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday,” and at that moment Father
Enter Input : Ferapont himself made his appearance, as though on purpose to increase the
Enter Input : confusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the
Enter Input : apiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglect
Enter Input : on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the rules binding
Enter Input : on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a
Enter Input : choice about it. For it would have been discreditable to insist on
Enter Input : burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day
Enter Input : and night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, the
Enter Input : monks would have said, “He is holier than all of us and he follows a rule
Enter Input : harder than ours. And if he does not go to church, it’s because he knows
Enter Input : when he ought to; he has his own rule.” It was to avoid the chance of
Enter Input : these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father
Enter Input : Zossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that “God’s judgment
Enter Input : is not the same as man’s,” and that something had happened which was “in
Enter Input : excess of nature.” It may well be supposed that among the first to run to
Enter Input : him with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the
Enter Input : evening before and left his cell terror-stricken.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have mentioned above, that though Father Païssy, standing firm and
Enter Input : immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see what
Enter Input : was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in his heart,
Enter Input : for he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken by it, but
Enter Input : awaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and
Enter Input : insight for the outcome of the general excitement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of
Enter Input : decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont
Enter Input : appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him a
Enter Input : crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not,
Enter Input : however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to
Enter Input : see what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certain
Enter Input : awe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing.
Enter Input : Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his
Enter Input : right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped
Enter Input : in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up the
Enter Input : steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther
Enter Input : back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding his
Enter Input : hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Casting out I cast out!” and, turning in all directions, he began at once
Enter Input : making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of
Enter Input : the cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately
Enter Input : understood his action. For they knew he always did this wherever he went,
Enter Input : and that he would not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out the
Enter Input : evil spirits.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!” he repeated at each sign of the cross.
Enter Input : “Casting out I cast out,” he roared again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest, covered
Enter Input : with gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet were bare.
Enter Input : As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore under his
Enter Input : gown could be heard clanking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Païssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before him
Enter Input : waiting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against good
Enter Input : order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?” he said at last,
Enter Input : looking sternly at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?” shouted Father
Enter Input : Ferapont crazily. “I’ve come here to drive out your visitors, the unclean
Enter Input : devils. I’ve come to see how many have gathered here while I have been
Enter Input : away. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him yourself,”
Enter Input : Father Païssy went on fearlessly. “And who can say of himself ‘I am holy’?
Enter Input : Can you, Father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not
Enter Input : have them bow down to me as an idol,” thundered Father Ferapont. “Nowadays
Enter Input : folk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,” he turned to the
Enter Input : crowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, “did not believe in devils.
Enter Input : He gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they have become as common
Enter Input : as spiders in the corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that
Enter Input : we see a great sign from God.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in his
Enter Input : dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits. When
Enter Input : in the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima, the elder had
Enter Input : advised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that was of no use,
Enter Input : he advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special
Enter Input : medicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as
Enter Input : they talked over it—and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the
Enter Input : censorious had hastened to report this “extraordinary” counsel on the part
Enter Input : of the elder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go away, Father!” said Father Païssy, in a commanding voice, “it’s not
Enter Input : for man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a ‘sign’ which neither
Enter Input : you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and do
Enter Input : not trouble the flock!” he repeated impressively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign
Enter Input : has come. That is clear and it’s a sin to hide it,” the fanatic, carried
Enter Input : away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be quieted. “He was
Enter Input : seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in their pockets, he
Enter Input : sipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with sweet things and his
Enter Input : mind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is put to shame....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You speak lightly, Father.” Father Païssy, too, raised his voice. “I
Enter Input : admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some
Enter Input : frivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!”
Enter Input : Father Païssy thundered in conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will go,” said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as
Enter Input : bitter. “You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my
Enter Input : humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have forgotten
Enter Input : what I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your
Enter Input : subtlety.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Païssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont paused
Enter Input : and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently, pronounced in a
Enter Input : sing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To-morrow they will sing over him ‘Our Helper and Defender’—a splendid
Enter Input : anthem—and over me when I die all they’ll sing will be ‘What earthly
Enter Input : joy’—a little canticle,”(6) he added with tearful regret. “You are proud
Enter Input : and puffed up, this is a vain place!” he shouted suddenly like a madman,
Enter Input : and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the
Enter Input : steps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once and
Enter Input : some lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Païssy, following
Enter Input : Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. But the excited old
Enter Input : fanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, he
Enter Input : suddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, as
Enter Input : though some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!” he shouted
Enter Input : frantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling face
Enter Input : downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by his
Enter Input : tears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up to him;
Enter Input : there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed
Enter Input : to take possession of them all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!” some
Enter Input : cried aloud, losing their fear. “This is he who should be an elder,”
Enter Input : others added malignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He wouldn’t be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn’t serve a
Enter Input : cursed innovation ... he wouldn’t imitate their foolery,” other voices
Enter Input : chimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but
Enter Input : at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossing
Enter Input : themselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went
Enter Input : back to his cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations which
Enter Input : were utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater number
Enter Input : dispersed, hastening to service. Father Païssy let Father Iosif read in
Enter Input : his place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could not shake
Enter Input : him, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special
Enter Input : reason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly wondered, “Why am I
Enter Input : sad even to dejection?” and immediately grasped with surprise that his
Enter Input : sudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowd
Enter Input : thronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and he
Enter Input : remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. “Can
Enter Input : that boy mean so much to my heart now?” he asked himself, wondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the direction
Enter Input : of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away his eyes and
Enter Input : dropped them to the ground, and from the boy’s look alone, Father Païssy
Enter Input : guessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you, too, fallen into temptation?” cried Father Païssy. “Can you be
Enter Input : with those of little faith?” he added mournfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Païssy, but quickly turned
Enter Input : his eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood sideways and
Enter Input : did not turn his face to Father Païssy, who watched him attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,” he asked again, but
Enter Input : again Alyosha gave no answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without asking
Enter Input : a blessing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at
Enter Input : the Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart and
Enter Input : mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And suddenly,
Enter Input : still without speaking, waved his hand, as though not caring even to be
Enter Input : respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the
Enter Input : hermitage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You will come back again!” murmured Father Païssy, looking after him with
Enter Input : sorrowful surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. A Critical Moment
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Father Païssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his “dear
Enter Input : boy” would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated
Enter Input : with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha’s spiritual condition. Yet I
Enter Input : must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear
Enter Input : account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love
Enter Input : so much. To Father Païssy’s sorrowful question, “Are you too with those of
Enter Input : little faith?” I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, “No, he
Enter Input : is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.” Indeed, all his
Enter Input : trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the
Enter Input : trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha
Enter Input : thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days
Enter Input : of his life. If the question is asked: “Could all his grief and
Enter Input : disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder’s body had shown
Enter Input : signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?”
Enter Input : I must answer without beating about the bush, “Yes, it certainly was.” I
Enter Input : would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my
Enter Input : young hero’s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or
Enter Input : to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little
Enter Input : progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare,
Enter Input : on the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his
Enter Input : heart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love
Enter Input : was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little
Enter Input : value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my
Enter Input : hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by
Enter Input : an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to
Enter Input : be unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always
Enter Input : sensible is to be suspected and is of little worth—that’s my opinion!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But,” reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, “every young man cannot
Enter Input : believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To this I reply again, “Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and
Enter Input : steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not
Enter Input : explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for
Enter Input : the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not a
Enter Input : question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of
Enter Input : miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the
Enter Input : triumph of some preconceived idea—oh, no, not at all—what he saw before
Enter Input : all was one figure—the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that
Enter Input : holy man whom he revered with such adoration. The fact is that all the
Enter Input : love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and
Enter Input : everything had, for the past year, been concentrated—and perhaps wrongly
Enter Input : so—on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long
Enter Input : been accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy
Enter Input : could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the
Enter Input : moment “of every one and everything.” He remembered afterwards how, on
Enter Input : that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about
Enter Input : whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten,
Enter Input : too, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha’s father, though he had so
Enter Input : warmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not
Enter Input : miracles he needed but only “the higher justice” which had been in his
Enter Input : belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his
Enter Input : heart. And what does it signify that this “justice” looked for by Alyosha
Enter Input : inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the
Enter Input : ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery cherished the
Enter Input : same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha
Enter Input : revered, Father Païssy himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubled
Enter Input : by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And a
Enter Input : whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this
Enter Input : expectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted for,
Enter Input : not simply miracles.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every one
Enter Input : in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was his
Enter Input : due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had judged him?
Enter Input : Who could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung his
Enter Input : inexperienced and virginal heart. He could not endure without
Enter Input : mortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men
Enter Input : should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the
Enter Input : frivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles, had
Enter Input : there been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why
Enter Input : this humiliation, why this premature decay, “in excess of nature,” as the
Enter Input : spiteful monks said? Why this “sign from heaven,” which they so
Enter Input : triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did they
Enter Input : believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the finger of
Enter Input : Providence? Why did Providence hide its face “at the most critical moment”
Enter Input : (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily submitting to the blind,
Enter Input : dumb, pitiless laws of nature?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That was why Alyosha’s heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have said
Enter Input : already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on
Enter Input : earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This murmuring may have been
Enter Input : shallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the third
Enter Input : time—and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my
Enter Input : feeling—I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that
Enter Input : moment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but,
Enter Input : if love does not gain the upper hand in a boy’s heart at such an
Enter Input : exceptional moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention
Enter Input : something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha’s mind
Enter Input : at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing
Enter Input : impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently
Enter Input : haunted Alyosha’s mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that
Enter Input : something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul
Enter Input : had been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though
Enter Input : he was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil
Enter Input : impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly
Enter Input : revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of
Enter Input : his consciousness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the
Enter Input : hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards
Enter Input : on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up
Enter Input : and called him by his name.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You here, Alexey? Can you have—” he began wondering but broke off. He had
Enter Input : meant to say, “Can you have come to this?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once
Enter Input : saw that he heard and understood him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter?” he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually
Enter Input : passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say, I’ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly
Enter Input : disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just look
Enter Input : at me...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree. He
Enter Input : was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his
Enter Input : face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side of
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know your face is quite changed? There’s none of your famous
Enter Input : mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been
Enter Input : ill-treating you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me alone,” said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his hand,
Enter Input : still looking away from him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oho! So that’s how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like other
Enter Input : mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you have
Enter Input : surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It’s long since I’ve been surprised
Enter Input : at anything here. I always took you for an educated man....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely
Enter Input : understanding what he said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to
Enter Input : stink? You don’t mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to
Enter Input : work miracles?” exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what more
Enter Input : do you want?” cried Alyosha irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen
Enter Input : believes in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with your
Enter Input : God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn’t given promotion, He hasn’t
Enter Input : bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, and there
Enter Input : was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am not rebelling against my God; I simply ‘don’t accept His world.’ ”
Enter Input : Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean, you don’t accept the world?” Rakitin thought a moment
Enter Input : over his answer. “What idiocy is this?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha did not answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat
Enter Input : to-day?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t remember.... I think I have.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look at
Enter Input : you. You didn’t sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in
Enter Input : there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you’ve had
Enter Input : nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I’ve got some sausage in my
Enter Input : pocket; I’ve brought it from the town in case of need, only you won’t eat
Enter Input : sausage....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me some.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say! You are going it! Why, it’s a regular mutiny, with barricades!
Enter Input : Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I
Enter Input : shouldn’t mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going
Enter Input : too far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me some vodka too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hullo! You surprise me, brother!” Rakitin looked at him in amazement.
Enter Input : “Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chance
Enter Input : and mustn’t be missed. Come along.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If your little brother Ivan could see this—wouldn’t he be surprised! By
Enter Input : the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his brother
Enter Input : Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though it reminded
Enter Input : him of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, some
Enter Input : terrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him, did not
Enter Input : reach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten.
Enter Input : But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a ‘liberal booby with no
Enter Input : talents whatsoever.’ Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I was
Enter Input : ‘dishonorable.’ Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense of
Enter Input : honor will do for you now.” This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a
Enter Input : whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen!” he said aloud, “let’s go by the path beyond the monastery
Enter Input : straight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov’s by the way.
Enter Input : Only fancy, I’ve written to tell her everything that happened, and would
Enter Input : you believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has a
Enter Input : passion for writing notes) that ‘she would never have expected _such
Enter Input : conduct_ from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.’ That
Enter Input : was her very word: ‘conduct.’ She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!”
Enter Input : he cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the
Enter Input : shoulder made him stop too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, Alyosha,” he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed in
Enter Input : a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was laughing
Enter Input : outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, so
Enter Input : difficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood
Enter Input : in which he now saw Alyosha. “Alyosha, do you know where we had better
Enter Input : go?” he brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t care ... where you like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let’s go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?” pronounced Rakitin at last,
Enter Input : trembling with timid suspense.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let’s go to Grushenka,” Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this prompt
Enter Input : and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost started
Enter Input : back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well! I say!” he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the
Enter Input : arm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change his
Enter Input : mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how glad she will be, how delighted!” he muttered, but lapsed into
Enter Input : silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was taking
Enter Input : Alyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anything
Enter Input : without a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case was
Enter Input : twofold, first a revengeful desire to see “the downfall of the righteous,”
Enter Input : and Alyosha’s fall “from the saints to the sinners,” over which he was
Enter Input : already gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had in
Enter Input : view a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said
Enter Input : later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So the critical moment has come,” he thought to himself with spiteful
Enter Input : glee, “and we shall catch it on the hop, for it’s just what we want.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. An Onion
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedral
Enter Input : square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house of
Enter Input : the widow Morozov. The house was a large stone building of two stories,
Enter Input : old and very ugly. The widow led a secluded life with her two unmarried
Enter Input : nieces, who were also elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, but
Enter Input : every one knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years
Enter Input : before, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was known
Enter Input : to be the girl’s protector. It was said that the jealous old man’s object
Enter Input : in placing his “favorite” with the widow Morozov was that the old woman
Enter Input : should keep a sharp eye on her new lodger’s conduct. But this sharp eye
Enter Input : soon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow Morozov seldom met
Enter Input : Grushenka and did not worry her by looking after her in any way. It is
Enter Input : true that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim,
Enter Input : delicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town
Enter Input : of the province, and much had happened since then. Little was known of the
Enter Input : girl’s history in the town and that little was vague. Nothing more had
Enter Input : been learnt during the last four years, even after many persons had become
Enter Input : interested in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna
Enter Input : had meanwhile developed. There were rumors that she had been at seventeen
Enter Input : betrayed by some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards
Enter Input : abandoned by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married, while
Enter Input : Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was said, however,
Enter Input : that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man,
Enter Input : Samsonov, she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical
Enter Input : class, that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little orphan
Enter Input : had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of bold and
Enter Input : determined character, proud and insolent. She had a good head for
Enter Input : business, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foul
Enter Input : had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune. There was only
Enter Input : one point on which all were agreed. Grushenka was not easily to be
Enter Input : approached and except her aged protector there had not been one man who
Enter Input : could boast of her favors during those four years. It was a positive fact,
Enter Input : for there had been a good many, especially during the last two years, who
Enter Input : had attempted to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been in
Enter Input : vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and
Enter Input : even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met
Enter Input : from the strong-willed young person. It was known, too, that the young
Enter Input : person had, especially of late, been given to what is called
Enter Input : “speculation,” and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction,
Enter Input : so that many people began to say that she was no better than a Jew. It was
Enter Input : not that she lent money on interest, but it was known, for instance, that
Enter Input : she had for some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actually
Enter Input : invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their
Enter Input : nominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and
Enter Input : merciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the last year
Enter Input : during which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs, he had
Enter Input : fallen greatly under the influence of his protégée, whom he had at first
Enter Input : kept strictly and in humble surroundings, “on Lenten fare,” as the wits
Enter Input : said at the time. But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself,
Enter Input : while she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity. The old
Enter Input : man, now long since dead, had had a large business in his day and was also
Enter Input : a noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka’s hold
Enter Input : upon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it had been so
Enter Input : especially for the last two years), he did not settle any considerable
Enter Input : fortune on her and would not have been moved to do so, if she had
Enter Input : threatened to leave him. But he had presented her with a small sum, and
Enter Input : even that was a surprise to every one when it became known.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are a wench with brains,” he said to her, when he gave her eight
Enter Input : thousand roubles, “and you must look after yourself, but let me tell you
Enter Input : that except your yearly allowance as before, you’ll get nothing more from
Enter Input : me to the day of my death, and I’ll leave you nothing in my will either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons, whom, with
Enter Input : their wives and children, he had treated all his life as servants.
Enter Input : Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known
Enter Input : afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital
Enter Input : and put business in her way.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a
Enter Input : piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love
Enter Input : with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is
Enter Input : remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was
Enter Input : absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have
Enter Input : been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when
Enter Input : Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off
Enter Input : laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest
Enter Input : piece of advice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you’d better choose
Enter Input : the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and
Enter Input : settle some fortune on you beforehand. But don’t keep on with the captain,
Enter Input : you’ll get no good out of that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his
Enter Input : death was not far off and who actually died five months later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the
Enter Input : grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the
Enter Input : object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really
Enter Input : underlay her attitude to both of them. Even Grushenka’s two servants
Enter Input : (after the catastrophe of which we will speak later) testified in court
Enter Input : that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because “he
Enter Input : threatened to murder her.” These servants were an old cook, invalidish and
Enter Input : almost deaf, who came from Grushenka’s old home, and her granddaughter, a
Enter Input : smart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka
Enter Input : lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious.
Enter Input : Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in
Enter Input : the fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms, yet they
Enter Input : were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her drawing-room on the
Enter Input : big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered with
Enter Input : shabby and ragged leather. Under her head she had two white down pillows
Enter Input : taken from her bed. She was lying stretched out motionless on her back
Enter Input : with her hands behind her head. She was dressed as though expecting some
Enter Input : one, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which
Enter Input : was very becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with
Enter Input : a massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She lay as
Enter Input : though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips and eyes
Enter Input : hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her right
Enter Input : foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement.
Enter Input : From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry out
Enter Input : in a frightened voice, “Who’s there?” But the maid met the visitors and at
Enter Input : once called back to her mistress.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not he, it’s nothing, only other visitors.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What can be the matter?” muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into the
Enter Input : drawing-room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A thick coil
Enter Input : of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on her
Enter Input : right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put it back till she
Enter Input : had gazed at her visitors and recognized them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, it’s you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?
Enter Input : Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!” she exclaimed,
Enter Input : recognizing Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do send for candles!” said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air of a most
Enter Input : intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle.... Well,
Enter Input : you have chosen a moment to bring him!” she exclaimed again, nodding
Enter Input : towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began quickly
Enter Input : fastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed displeased.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Haven’t I managed to please you?” asked Rakitin, instantly almost
Enter Input : offended.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You frightened me, Rakitin, that’s what it is.” Grushenka turned with a
Enter Input : smile to Alyosha. “Don’t be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot
Enter Input : think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor. But you frightened
Enter Input : me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I deceived him
Enter Input : just now, I made him promise to believe me and I told him a lie. I told
Enter Input : him that I was going to spend the evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch,
Enter Input : and should be there till late counting up his money. I always spend one
Enter Input : whole evening a week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in
Enter Input : and he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in
Enter Input : the book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there,
Enter Input : but I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some news.
Enter Input : How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open it
Enter Input : and look about whether the captain is to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and
Enter Input : spying, I am dreadfully frightened.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I’ve just looked out, I keep
Enter Input : running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains—that’s
Enter Input : better!” She drew the heavy curtains herself. “He’d rush in at once if he
Enter Input : saw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed very happy
Enter Input : about something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?” inquired Rakitin. “I should have
Enter Input : thought you were not timid with him, you’d twist him round your little
Enter Input : finger.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don’t want Mitya at
Enter Input : all. And he didn’t believe, I feel he didn’t, that I should stay at Kuzma
Enter Input : Kuzmitch’s. He must be in his ambush now, behind Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, in
Enter Input : the garden, watching for me. And if he’s there, he won’t come here, so
Enter Input : much the better! But I really have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch’s, Mitya
Enter Input : escorted me there. I told him I should stay there till midnight, and I
Enter Input : asked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home. He went away
Enter Input : and I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I
Enter Input : was afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you’ve got on!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting a
Enter Input : message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and you
Enter Input : will see no more of me. That’s why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And where are you flying to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you know too much, you’ll get old too soon.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I’ve never seen you like this
Enter Input : before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.” Rakitin looked
Enter Input : her up and down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Much you know about balls.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you know much about them?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch’s son was
Enter Input : married and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want to be
Enter Input : talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here. Such a
Enter Input : visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and can’t believe my eyes.
Enter Input : Good heavens, can you have come here to see me! To tell you the truth, I
Enter Input : never had a thought of seeing you and I didn’t think that you would ever
Enter Input : come and see me. Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to
Enter Input : see you. Sit down on the sofa, here, that’s right, my bright young moon. I
Enter Input : really can’t take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had brought
Enter Input : him yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is! Perhaps it’s
Enter Input : better he has come now, at such a moment, and not the day before
Enter Input : yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him with
Enter Input : positive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying when she said
Enter Input : so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a good-hearted merry
Enter Input : laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in her
Enter Input : face.... He had hardly met her till the day before, he had formed an
Enter Input : alarming idea of her, and had been horribly distressed the day before by
Enter Input : the spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He
Enter Input : was greatly surprised to find her now altogether different from what he
Enter Input : had expected. And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes
Enter Input : involuntarily rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed
Enter Input : changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace of
Enter Input : that mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness in her
Enter Input : movements. Everything was simple and good-natured, her gestures were
Enter Input : rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!” she chattered on again.
Enter Input : “And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn’t say myself! If you
Enter Input : ask me, I couldn’t tell you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, don’t you know why you’re glad?” said Rakitin, grinning. “You used
Enter Input : to be always pestering me to bring him, you’d some object, I suppose.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I had a different object once, but now that’s over, this is not the
Enter Input : moment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-natured
Enter Input : now. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing? You’ve sat down
Enter Input : already? There’s no fear of Rakitin’s forgetting to look after himself.
Enter Input : Look, Alyosha, he’s sitting there opposite us, so offended that I didn’t
Enter Input : ask him to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to take
Enter Input : offense!” laughed Grushenka. “Don’t be angry, Rakitin, I’m kind to-day.
Enter Input : Why are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped into
Enter Input : his eyes with merry mockery”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s sad. The promotion has not been given,” boomed Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What promotion?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His elder stinks.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something nasty. Be
Enter Input : quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this.” She
Enter Input : suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his knee, like a
Enter Input : nestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck. “I’ll cheer you up, my
Enter Input : pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee? You won’t be
Enter Input : angry? If you tell me, I’ll get off?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words, “If you
Enter Input : tell me, I’ll get off,” but he did not answer. But there was nothing in
Enter Input : his heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly from his
Enter Input : corner, might have expected or fancied. The great grief in his heart
Enter Input : swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused, and, if only he
Enter Input : could have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he
Enter Input : had now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation.
Enter Input : Yet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and
Enter Input : the sorrow that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new and
Enter Input : strange sensation in his heart. This woman, this “dreadful” woman, had no
Enter Input : terror for him now, none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at
Enter Input : any passing thought of woman. On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above
Enter Input : all women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in
Enter Input : him now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the
Enter Input : intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his former
Enter Input : terror. That was what instinctively surprised him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve talked nonsense enough,” cried Rakitin, “you’d much better give us
Enter Input : some champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on the
Enter Input : top of everything, if he’d bring you? I’ll have some too! Fenya, Fenya,
Enter Input : bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so stingy, I’ll
Enter Input : stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you’re a toadstool, but he is a
Enter Input : falcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it,
Enter Input : I’ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, or
Enter Input : is it a secret?” Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretend
Enter Input : not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ech, it’s not a secret, and you know it, too,” Grushenka said, in a voice
Enter Input : suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a little
Enter Input : away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his
Enter Input : neck. “My officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I heard he was coming, but is he so near?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is at Mokroe now; he’ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I
Enter Input : got a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger every minute.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t say so! Why at Mokroe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a long story, I’ve told you enough.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya’ll be up to something now—I say! Does he know or doesn’t he?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He know! Of course he doesn’t. If he knew, there would be murder. But I
Enter Input : am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet,
Enter Input : Rakitin, don’t remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my heart.
Enter Input : And I don’t want to think of that at this moment. I can think of Alyosha
Enter Input : here, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my
Enter Input : foolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, he’s smiling, he’s smiling! How kindly
Enter Input : he looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, I’ve been thinking all this time
Enter Input : you were angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of
Enter Input : that young lady. I was a cur, that’s the truth.... But it’s a good thing
Enter Input : it happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.” Grushenka
Enter Input : smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile. “Mitya told
Enter Input : me that she screamed out that I ‘ought to be flogged.’ I did insult her
Enter Input : dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a conquest of me, to win
Enter Input : me over with her chocolate.... No, it’s a good thing it did end like
Enter Input : that.” She smiled again. “But I am still afraid of your being angry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that’s really true,” Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise.
Enter Input : “Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you’ve no conscience, that’s
Enter Input : what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that’s how it is!
Enter Input : Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, what of it, I love him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That is quite different.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a woman’s way of looking at it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t you make me angry, Rakitin.” Grushenka caught him up hotly. “This
Enter Input : is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. It’s true, Alyosha,
Enter Input : I had sly designs on you before. For I am a horrid, violent creature. But
Enter Input : at other times I’ve looked upon you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I’ve kept
Enter Input : thinking ‘how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me.’ I
Enter Input : thought that the day before yesterday, as I ran home from the young
Enter Input : lady’s. I have thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya
Enter Input : knows, I’ve talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe
Enter Input : it, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of
Enter Input : myself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that,
Enter Input : I can’t say, I don’t remember....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of
Enter Input : champagne on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here’s the champagne!” cried Rakitin. “You’re excited, Agrafena
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you’ve had a glass of champagne,
Enter Input : you’ll be ready to dance. Eh, they can’t even do that properly,” he added,
Enter Input : looking at the bottle. “The old woman’s poured it out in the kitchen and
Enter Input : the bottle’s been brought in warm and without a cork. Well, let me have
Enter Input : some, anyway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and poured
Enter Input : himself out another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One doesn’t often stumble upon champagne,” he said, licking his lips.
Enter Input : “Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do! What shall we drink to?
Enter Input : The gates of paradise? Take a glass, Grushenka, you drink to the gates of
Enter Input : paradise, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What gates of paradise?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I’d better not,” he smiled gently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you bragged!” cried Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if so, I won’t either,” chimed in Grushenka, “I really don’t want
Enter Input : any. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin. If Alyosha has some, I
Enter Input : will.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What touching sentimentality!” said Rakitin tauntingly; “and she’s
Enter Input : sitting on his knee, too! He’s got something to grieve over, but what’s
Enter Input : the matter with you? He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat
Enter Input : sausage....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So Father Zossima is dead,” cried Grushenka. “Good God, I did not know!”
Enter Input : She crossed herself devoutly. “Goodness, what have I been doing, sitting
Enter Input : on his knee like this at such a moment!” She started up as though in
Enter Input : dismay, instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in
Enter Input : his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Rakitin,” he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; “don’t taunt me
Enter Input : with having rebelled against God. I don’t want to feel angry with you, so
Enter Input : you must be kinder, too, I’ve lost a treasure such as you have never had,
Enter Input : and you cannot judge me now. You had much better look at her—do you see
Enter Input : how she has pity on me? I came here to find a wicked soul—I felt drawn to
Enter Input : evil because I was base and evil myself, and I’ve found a true sister, I
Enter Input : have found a treasure—a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You’ve raised my soul from
Enter Input : the depths.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha’s lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She has saved you, it seems,” laughed Rakitin spitefully. “And she meant
Enter Input : to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Rakitin.” Grushenka jumped up. “Hush, both of you. Now I’ll tell
Enter Input : you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad
Enter Input : and not good—that’s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you are
Enter Input : telling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, but
Enter Input : now you are lying, now it’s all different. And don’t let me hear anything
Enter Input : more from you, Rakitin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are both crazy,” said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. “I
Enter Input : feel as though I were in a madhouse. They’re both getting so feeble
Enter Input : they’ll begin crying in a minute.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall begin to cry, I shall,” repeated Grushenka. “He called me his
Enter Input : sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin,
Enter Input : though I am bad, I did give away an onion.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed, though
Enter Input : he might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a
Enter Input : spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime. But though
Enter Input : Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he was
Enter Input : very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others—partly from
Enter Input : his youth and inexperience, partly from his intense egoism.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, Alyosha,” Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh. “I was
Enter Input : boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but it’s not to
Enter Input : boast I tell you about it. It’s only a story, but it’s a nice story. I
Enter Input : used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who is still
Enter Input : with me. It’s like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a
Enter Input : very wicked woman she was. And she died and did not leave a single good
Enter Input : deed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire.
Enter Input : So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could
Enter Input : remember to tell to God; ‘She once pulled up an onion in her garden,’ said
Enter Input : he, ‘and gave it to a beggar woman.’ And God answered: ‘You take that
Enter Input : onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold and be
Enter Input : pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to
Enter Input : Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.’
Enter Input : The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. ‘Come,’ said he,
Enter Input : ‘catch hold and I’ll pull you out.’ And he began cautiously pulling her
Enter Input : out. He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the lake,
Enter Input : seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be
Enter Input : pulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking
Enter Input : them. ‘I’m to be pulled out, not you. It’s my onion, not yours.’ As soon
Enter Input : as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and
Enter Input : she is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away. So
Enter Input : that’s the story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman
Enter Input : myself. I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you
Enter Input : I’ll say: ‘I’ve done nothing but give away one onion all my life, that’s
Enter Input : the only good deed I’ve done.’ So don’t praise me, Alyosha, don’t think me
Enter Input : good, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise
Enter Input : me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was so anxious to
Enter Input : get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he would
Enter Input : bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out a
Enter Input : purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What nonsense! What nonsense!” cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there’s no fear of your refusing it, you
Enter Input : asked for it yourself.” And she threw the note to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Likely I should refuse it,” boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, but
Enter Input : carrying off his confusion with a swagger. “That will come in very handy;
Enter Input : fools are made for wise men’s profit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not for
Enter Input : your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You don’t like us, so
Enter Input : hold your tongue.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What should I like you for?” Rakitin snarled, not concealing his
Enter Input : ill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket and he felt
Enter Input : ashamed at Alyosha’s seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving his payment
Enter Input : later, without Alyosha’s knowing of it, and now, feeling ashamed, he lost
Enter Input : his temper. Till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradict
Enter Input : Grushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing, since he had something to
Enter Input : get out of her. But now he, too, was angry:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done for
Enter Input : me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a fuss
Enter Input : about it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with heat and
Enter Input : there were hysterical notes in her voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don’t dare to speak to me
Enter Input : like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and be
Enter Input : quiet, as though you were my footman! And now, Alyosha, I’ll tell you the
Enter Input : whole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talking to
Enter Input : Rakitin, but to you. I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, that’s the holy truth;
Enter Input : I quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.
Enter Input : And why did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,
Enter Input : you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes. And I’ve
Enter Input : looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking every one
Enter Input : about you. Your face haunted my heart. ‘He despises me,’ I thought; ‘he
Enter Input : won’t even look at me.’ And I felt it so much at last that I wondered at
Enter Input : myself for being so frightened of a boy. I’ll get him in my clutches and
Enter Input : laugh at him. I was full of spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody
Enter Input : here dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil
Enter Input : purpose. Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was
Enter Input : bound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has been no
Enter Input : one else. But looking at you, I thought, I’ll get him in my clutches and
Enter Input : laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me your
Enter Input : sister! And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for a
Enter Input : message from him. And do you know what that man has been to me? Five years
Enter Input : ago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one
Enter Input : might have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used to
Enter Input : sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: ‘Where is he
Enter Input : now, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with another woman, most
Enter Input : likely. If only I could see him, if I could meet him again, I’d pay him
Enter Input : out, I’d pay him out!’ At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in
Enter Input : the dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose
Enter Input : and gloat over my anger. ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ That’s what
Enter Input : I used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should
Enter Input : really do nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps
Enter Input : had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into
Enter Input : helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I would
Enter Input : get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces.
Enter Input : And then what do you think? I began saving money, I became hard-hearted,
Enter Input : grew stout—grew wiser, would you say? No, no one in the whole world sees
Enter Input : it, no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did
Enter Input : five years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all
Enter Input : night, thinking, ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ Do you hear? Well
Enter Input : then, now you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me—he was
Enter Input : coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath away;
Enter Input : then I suddenly thought: ‘If he comes and whistles to call me, I shall
Enter Input : creep back to him like a beaten dog.’ I couldn’t believe myself. Am I so
Enter Input : abject? Shall I run to him or not? And I’ve been in such a rage with
Enter Input : myself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago. Do you
Enter Input : see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shown
Enter Input : you the whole truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that
Enter Input : other. Hush, Rakitin, it’s not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to
Enter Input : you. Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my
Enter Input : whole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,
Enter Input : Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened
Enter Input : the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I am
Enter Input : going through now, and no one ever can know.... For perhaps I shall take a
Enter Input : knife with me to-day, I can’t make up my mind ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And at this “tragic” phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face in her
Enter Input : hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little child.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Misha,” he said, “don’t be angry. She wounded you, but don’t be angry.
Enter Input : You heard what she said just now? You mustn’t ask too much of human
Enter Input : endurance, one must be merciful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He felt
Enter Input : obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there,
Enter Input : he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him ironically and
Enter Input : Alyosha stopped short.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You were so primed up with your elder’s teaching last night that now you
Enter Input : have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!” said Rakitin, with a smile
Enter Input : of hatred.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t laugh, Rakitin, don’t smile, don’t talk of the dead—he was better
Enter Input : than any one in the world!” cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. “I
Enter Input : didn’t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am I
Enter Input : beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, ‘What does it
Enter Input : matter?’ in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soon
Enter Input : as any one says a word from the heart to her—it makes her forget
Enter Input : everything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged her
Enter Input : has come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, and
Enter Input : hastens joyfully to meet him and she won’t take a knife with her. She
Enter Input : won’t! No, I am not like that. I don’t know whether you are, Misha, but I
Enter Input : am not like that. It’s a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....
Enter Input : Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us? No, you
Enter Input : haven’t; if you had, you’d have understood her long ago ... and the person
Enter Input : insulted the day before yesterday must forgive her, too! She will, when
Enter Input : she knows ... and she shall know.... This soul is not yet at peace with
Enter Input : itself, one must be tender with it ... there may be a treasure in that
Enter Input : soul....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his ill-humor
Enter Input : Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never expected such a
Enter Input : tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love with her?
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk’s really in love with you, you’ve made a
Enter Input : conquest!” he cried, with a coarse laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with a
Enter Input : tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not a person
Enter Input : for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,” she turned to Rakitin, “I meant
Enter Input : to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now I don’t want to.
Enter Input : Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.” She beckoned to him with a happy
Enter Input : smile. “That’s right, sit here. Tell me,” she shook him by the hand and
Enter Input : peeped into his face, smiling, “tell me, do I love that man or not? the
Enter Input : man who wronged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in
Enter Input : the dark, asking my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the
Enter Input : time has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you have forgiven him already,” said Alyosha, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I really have forgiven him,” Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. “What
Enter Input : an abject heart! To my abject heart!” She snatched up a glass from the
Enter Input : table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it on the
Enter Input : floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came into her
Enter Input : smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps I haven’t forgiven him, though,” she said, with a sort of menace
Enter Input : in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though she were
Enter Input : talking to herself. “Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive. I
Enter Input : shall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, I’ve grown to love my
Enter Input : tears in these five years.... Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him
Enter Input : ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I shouldn’t care to be in his shoes,” hissed Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you won’t be, Rakitin, you’ll never be in his shoes. You shall
Enter Input : black my shoes, Rakitin, that’s the place you are fit for. You’ll never
Enter Input : get a woman like me ... and he won’t either, perhaps ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Won’t he? Then why are you dressed up like that?” said Rakitin, with a
Enter Input : venomous sneer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don’t know all that is in
Enter Input : my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I’ll tear it off at once,
Enter Input : this minute,” she cried in a resonant voice. “You don’t know what that
Enter Input : finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and say: ‘Have you ever
Enter Input : seen me look like this before?’ He left me a thin, consumptive cry-baby of
Enter Input : seventeen. I’ll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up. ‘Do you see
Enter Input : what I am like now?’ I’ll say to him; ‘well, and that’s enough for you, my
Enter Input : dear sir, there’s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip!’ That may be what
Enter Input : the finery is for, Rakitin.” Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.
Enter Input : “I’m violent and resentful, Alyosha, I’ll tear off my finery, I’ll destroy
Enter Input : my beauty, I’ll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn beggar. If
Enter Input : I choose, I won’t go anywhere now to see any one. If I choose, I’ll send
Enter Input : Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow, and all his money and I’ll
Enter Input : go out charing for the rest of my life. You think I wouldn’t do it,
Enter Input : Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it? I would, I would, I could do it
Enter Input : directly, only don’t exasperate me ... and I’ll send him about his
Enter Input : business, I’ll snap my fingers in his face, he shall never see me again!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down again,
Enter Input : hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Rakitin got up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s time we were off,” he said, “it’s late, we shall be shut out of the
Enter Input : monastery.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka leapt up from her place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Surely you don’t want to go, Alyosha!” she cried, in mournful surprise.
Enter Input : “What are you doing to me? You’ve stirred up my feeling, tortured me, and
Enter Input : now you’ll leave me to face this night alone!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to, let him!
Enter Input : I’ll go alone,” Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush, evil tongue!” Grushenka cried angrily at him; “you never said such
Enter Input : words to me as he has come to say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What has he said to you so special?” asked Rakitin irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t say, I don’t know. I don’t know what he said to me, it went
Enter Input : straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the first, the only
Enter Input : one who has pitied me, that’s what it is. Why did you not come before, you
Enter Input : angel?” She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy.
Enter Input : “I’ve been waiting all my life for some one like you, I knew that some one
Enter Input : like you would come and forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some
Enter Input : one would really love me, not only with a shameful love!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What have I done to you?” answered Alyosha, bending over her with a
Enter Input : tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; “I only gave you an
Enter Input : onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment there was a
Enter Input : sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall. Grushenka jumped
Enter Input : up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily into the room, crying out:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,” she cried,
Enter Input : breathless and joyful. “A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey the
Enter Input : driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses.... A
Enter Input : letter, here’s the letter, mistress.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while she
Enter Input : talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the
Enter Input : candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has sent for me,” she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan
Enter Input : smile; “he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the
Enter Input : blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will go,” she cried; “five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha,
Enter Input : my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don’t let me see you
Enter Input : again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don’t you remember evil
Enter Input : against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as
Enter Input : though I were drunk!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, she has no thoughts for us now!” grumbled Rakitin. “Let’s go, or we
Enter Input : may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and
Enter Input : cries.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a covered
Enter Input : cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and
Enter Input : fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate.
Enter Input : But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka’s
Enter Input : bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after
Enter Input : Alyosha:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to
Enter Input : remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him,
Enter Input : too, in my words: ‘Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you,
Enter Input : noble heart.’ And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only
Enter Input : one short hour she loved him—so let him remember that hour all his
Enter Input : life—say, ‘Grushenka tells you to!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “H’m, h’m!” growled Rakitin, laughing, “she murders your brother Mitya and
Enter Input : then tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast beside
Enter Input : Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought and moved
Enter Input : mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touched
Enter Input : on an open wound. He had expected something quite different by bringing
Enter Input : Grushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he had
Enter Input : hoped for had happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a Pole, that officer of hers,” he began again, restraining himself;
Enter Input : “and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the customs in
Enter Input : Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of a
Enter Input : Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He’s heard now that Grushenka’s
Enter Input : saved a little money, so he’s turned up again—that’s the explanation of
Enter Input : the mystery.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, so you’ve saved the sinner?” he laughed spitefully. “Have you
Enter Input : turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh?
Enter Input : So you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to
Enter Input : pass!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush, Rakitin,” Alyosha answered with an aching heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I’ve sold my friend,
Enter Input : you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I’d forgotten about it,” cried Alyosha, “you
Enter Input : remind me of it yourself....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damnation take you all and each of you!” he cried suddenly, “why the
Enter Input : devil did I take you up? I don’t want to know you from this time forward.
Enter Input : Go alone, there’s your road!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the
Enter Input : dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to the
Enter Input : monastery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returned
Enter Input : to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a special entrance. It had
Enter Input : struck nine o’clock—the hour of rest and repose after a day of such
Enter Input : agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into the
Enter Input : elder’s cell where his coffin was now standing. There was no one in the
Enter Input : cell but Father Païssy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin,
Enter Input : and the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night’s
Enter Input : conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the
Enter Input : deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father
Enter Input : Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.
Enter Input : Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his knees
Enter Input : and began to pray.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation
Enter Input : stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow,
Enter Input : continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange to
Enter Input : say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw that coffin before him,
Enter Input : the hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping and poignant
Enter Input : grief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came
Enter Input : in, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy
Enter Input : was glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell was
Enter Input : open, the air was fresh and cool. “So the smell must have become stronger,
Enter Input : if they opened the window,” thought Alyosha. But even this thought of the
Enter Input : smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a
Enter Input : few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He began
Enter Input : quietly praying, but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically.
Enter Input : Fragments of thought floated through his soul, flashed like stars and went
Enter Input : out again at once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning
Enter Input : in his soul a sense of the wholeness of things—something steadfast and
Enter Input : comforting—and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying
Enter Input : ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, and
Enter Input : sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it.
Enter Input : He began listening to what Father Païssy was reading, but worn out with
Enter Input : exhaustion he gradually began to doze.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_” read Father
Enter Input : Païssy. “_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called,
Enter Input : and his disciples, to the marriage._”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Marriage? What’s that?... A marriage!” floated whirling through Alyosha’s
Enter Input : mind. “There is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to the feast....
Enter Input : No, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Well
Enter Input : ... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases
Enter Input : comfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to
Enter Input : bear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods
Enter Input : over his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the high
Enter Input : road ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal, and the sun
Enter Input : is at the end of it.... Ah!... What’s being read?”...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have
Enter Input : no wine_” ... Alyosha heard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn’t want to miss it, I love that
Enter Input : passage: it’s Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that miracle! Ah,
Enter Input : that sweet miracle! It was not men’s grief, but their joy Christ visited,
Enter Input : He worked His first miracle to help men’s gladness.... ‘He who loves men
Enter Input : loves their gladness, too’ ... He was always repeating that, it was one of
Enter Input : his leading ideas.... ‘There’s no living without joy,’ Mitya says.... Yes,
Enter Input : Mitya.... ‘Everything that is true and good is always full of
Enter Input : forgiveness,’ he used to say that, too” ...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mine
Enter Input : hour is not yet come._
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
Enter Input : it_” ...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people.... Of
Enter Input : course they were poor, since they hadn’t wine enough even at a wedding....
Enter Input : The historians write that, in those days, the people living about the Lake
Enter Input : of Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined ... and
Enter Input : another great heart, that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had
Enter Input : come not only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His
Enter Input : heart was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure and
Enter Input : unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor wedding. ‘Mine
Enter Input : hour is not yet come,’ He said, with a soft smile (He must have smiled
Enter Input : gently to her). And, indeed, was it to make wine abundant at poor weddings
Enter Input : He had come down to earth? And yet He went and did as she asked Him....
Enter Input : Ah, he is reading again”....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
Enter Input : them up to the brim._
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the
Enter Input : feast. And they bare it._
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and
Enter Input : knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the
Enter Input : governor of the feast called the bridegroom,_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;
Enter Input : and when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast kept the
Enter Input : good wine until now._”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what’s this, what’s this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah, yes
Enter Input : ... It’s the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of course. Here are the
Enter Input : guests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ...
Enter Input : Where is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who? Again the
Enter Input : walls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great table?
Enter Input : What!... He here, too? But he’s in the coffin ... but he’s here, too. He
Enter Input : has stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!”...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man, with tiny
Enter Input : wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There was no coffin now,
Enter Input : and he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with them,
Enter Input : when the visitors had gathered about him. His face was uncovered, his eyes
Enter Input : were shining. How was this, then? He, too, had been called to the feast.
Enter Input : He, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,” he heard a soft voice
Enter Input : saying over him. “Why have you hidden yourself here, out of sight? You
Enter Input : come and join us too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he, since he
Enter Input : called him!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are rejoicing,” the little, thin old man went on. “We are drinking the
Enter Input : new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many guests?
Enter Input : Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of the feast,
Enter Input : he is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a
Enter Input : beggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only an onion
Enter Input : each—only one little onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle
Enter Input : one, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman an
Enter Input : onion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!... Do you
Enter Input : see our Sun, do you see Him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am afraid ... I dare not look,” whispered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His sublimity,
Enter Input : but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto us from love and
Enter Input : rejoices with us. He is changing the water into wine that the gladness of
Enter Input : the guests may not be cut short. He is expecting new guests, He is calling
Enter Input : new ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There they are bringing new
Enter Input : wine. Do you see they are bringing the vessels....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Something glowed in Alyosha’s heart, something filled it till it ached,
Enter Input : tears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out his hands,
Enter Input : uttered a cry and waked up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct reading
Enter Input : of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. It was strange,
Enter Input : he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was on his feet, and
Enter Input : suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid steps he went
Enter Input : right up to the coffin. His shoulder brushed against Father Païssy without
Enter Input : his noticing it. Father Païssy raised his eyes for an instant from his
Enter Input : book, but looked away again at once, seeing that something strange was
Enter Input : happening to the boy. Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at
Enter Input : the covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on
Enter Input : his breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He
Enter Input : had only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in
Enter Input : his ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly he
Enter Input : turned sharply and went out of the cell.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his soul,
Enter Input : overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. The vault
Enter Input : of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless
Enter Input : above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to the
Enter Input : horizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth. The white
Enter Input : towers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire
Enter Input : sky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were
Enter Input : slumbering till morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the
Enter Input : silence of the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of
Enter Input : the stars....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He did
Enter Input : not know why he embraced it. He could not have told why he longed so
Enter Input : irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he kissed it weeping, sobbing
Enter Input : and watering it with his tears, and vowed passionately to love it, to love
Enter Input : it for ever and ever. “Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love
Enter Input : those tears,” echoed in his soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What was he weeping over?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Oh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which were
Enter Input : shining to him from the abyss of space, and “he was not ashamed of that
Enter Input : ecstasy.” There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of
Enter Input : God, linking his soul to them, and it was trembling all over “in contact
Enter Input : with other worlds.” He longed to forgive every one and for everything, and
Enter Input : to beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all men, for all and for
Enter Input : everything. “And others are praying for me too,” echoed again in his soul.
Enter Input : But with every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that
Enter Input : something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his
Enter Input : soul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his
Enter Input : mind—and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had fallen on
Enter Input : the earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion, and he knew and
Enter Input : felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy. And never, never, all
Enter Input : his life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Some one visited my soul in that hour,” he used to say afterwards, with
Enter Input : implicit faith in his words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Within three days he left the monastery in accordance with the words of
Enter Input : his elder, who had bidden him “sojourn in the world.”

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her
Enter Input : last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knew
Enter Input : nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a condition
Enter Input : of feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been in
Enter Input : such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill
Enter Input : with brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able
Enter Input : to find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him
Enter Input : at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders,
Enter Input : concealed his movements.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,
Enter Input : “struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,” as he expressed
Enter Input : it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash out of the
Enter Input : town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose sight of
Enter Input : Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in detail, and
Enter Input : confirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only note
Enter Input : the most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediately
Enter Input : preceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely and
Enter Input : sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. The
Enter Input : worst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To prevail
Enter Input : upon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would yield to
Enter Input : nothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from him
Enter Input : altogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that
Enter Input : she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of
Enter Input : extraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something,
Enter Input : and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he
Enter Input : divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him
Enter Input : and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing
Enter Input : Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay
Enter Input : between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded
Enter Input : that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka
Enter Input : lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary
Enter Input : hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached
Enter Input : this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That
Enter Input : was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka’s
Enter Input : uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most
Enter Input : to her advantage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the
Enter Input : approaching return of the “officer,” that is, of the man who had been such
Enter Input : a fatal influence in Grushenka’s life, and whose arrival she was expecting
Enter Input : with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been
Enter Input : very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had
Enter Input : received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own
Enter Input : lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite
Enter Input : Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached
Enter Input : hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.
Enter Input : Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his
Enter Input : own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more
Enter Input : terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did not believe in a suitor
Enter Input : who suddenly turned up again after five years’ disappearance, still less
Enter Input : in his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the “officer’s” first letter which had
Enter Input : been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival’s visit was very
Enter Input : vaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of
Enter Input : sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the
Enter Input : last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more
Enter Input : definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered
Enter Input : afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from
Enter Input : Siberia on Grushenka’s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed
Enter Input : later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely
Enter Input : forgotten the officer’s existence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take,
Enter Input : his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be
Enter Input : decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every
Enter Input : moment Grushenka’s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly,
Enter Input : on the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: “Take
Enter Input : me, I’m yours for ever,” and it would all be over. He would seize her and
Enter Input : bear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her
Enter Input : away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,
Enter Input : if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with her
Enter Input : incognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or
Enter Input : anywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Of this different, reformed and “virtuous” life (“it must, it must be
Enter Input : virtuous”) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that
Enter Input : reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his
Enter Input : own free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in such
Enter Input : cases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not for
Enter Input : these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he
Enter Input : could fly away from this accursed place—he would be altogether
Enter Input : regenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and
Enter Input : what he was yearning for.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solution
Enter Input : of the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful
Enter Input : ending. Suddenly she might say to him: “Go away. I have just come to terms
Enter Input : with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don’t want you”—and
Enter Input : then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to
Enter Input : the last hour he didn’t know. That must be said to his credit. He had no
Enter Input : definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and
Enter Input : spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution
Enter Input : of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending
Enter Input : a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and
Enter Input : insoluble difficulty presented itself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : If she were to say to him: “I’m yours; take me away,” how could he take
Enter Input : her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at this
Enter Input : time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had
Enter Input : gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had
Enter Input : money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced
Enter Input : extraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life
Enter Input : with her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive
Enter Input : of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense
Enter Input : repulsion. I won’t enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine
Enter Input : myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may
Enter Input : have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his
Enter Input : conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly
Enter Input : appropriated. “I’ve been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a
Enter Input : scoundrel again to the other directly,” was his feeling then, as he
Enter Input : explained after: “and when Grushenka knows, she won’t care for such a
Enter Input : scoundrel.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money?
Enter Input : Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, “and only because
Enter Input : I hadn’t the money. Oh, the shame of it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew,
Enter Input : perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as
Enter Input : it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however
Enter Input : obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have the
Enter Input : right_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna’s three
Enter Input : thousand—if not, “I’m a common pickpocket, I’m a scoundrel, and I don’t
Enter Input : want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,” Mitya decided. And so he made up
Enter Input : his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three
Enter Input : thousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so to
Enter Input : say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last
Enter Input : interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the evening
Enter Input : when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing
Enter Input : Alyosha’s account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told
Enter Input : him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After
Enter Input : parting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it
Enter Input : would be better “to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to
Enter Input : Katya. I’d rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I’d rather
Enter Input : go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived
Enter Input : her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with Grushenka and
Enter Input : begin a new life! That I can’t do!” So Mitya decided, grinding his teeth,
Enter Input : and he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. But
Enter Input : meanwhile he went on struggling....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left for
Enter Input : him but despair—for what chance had he, with nothing in the world, to
Enter Input : raise such a sum?—yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would
Enter Input : get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of
Enter Input : itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with
Enter Input : people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except
Enter Input : to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of
Enter Input : their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most
Enter Input : fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had
Enter Input : parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a tangle
Enter Input : of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wild
Enter Input : enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the most
Enter Input : impossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenka’s
Enter Input : protector, and to propose a “scheme” to him, and by means of it to obtain
Enter Input : from him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the commercial value of
Enter Input : his scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain how
Enter Input : Samsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from
Enter Input : any but the commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by
Enter Input : sight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him.
Enter Input : But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that
Enter Input : the old reprobate, who was lying at death’s door, would perhaps not at all
Enter Input : object now to Grushenka’s securing a respectable position, and marrying a
Enter Input : man “to be depended upon.” And he believed not only that he would not
Enter Input : object, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that
Enter Input : he would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray
Enter Input : word of Grushenka’s, he had gathered further that the old man would
Enter Input : perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on
Enter Input : such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the
Enter Input : hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of
Enter Input : delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka’s past as
Enter Input : something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and
Enter Input : resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told
Enter Input : him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a
Enter Input : new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive
Enter Input : one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov,
Enter Input : Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in
Enter Input : that remote past of Grushenka’s, though she had never loved him, and who
Enter Input : was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say,
Enter Input : non-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for
Enter Input : it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck,
Enter Input : whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now
Enter Input : simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya’s part in all this, for in
Enter Input : spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It was an
Enter Input : instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, being
Enter Input : on the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerely
Enter Input : repent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had no more
Enter Input : devoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly slept
Enter Input : all night, and at ten o’clock next morning, he was at the house of
Enter Input : Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very large and
Enter Input : gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses. In the lower
Enter Input : story lived Samsonov’s two married sons with their families, his old
Enter Input : sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his clerks,
Enter Input : one of whom also had a large family. Both the lodge and the lower story
Enter Input : were overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and
Enter Input : would not even let the daughter live there with him, though she waited
Enter Input : upon him, and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours,
Enter Input : and at any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show,
Enter Input : furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rows
Enter Input : of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers under
Enter Input : shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these rooms were entirely
Enter Input : empty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remote
Enter Input : bedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her
Enter Input : head, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to
Enter Input : his swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only
Enter Input : rarely lifted from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting
Enter Input : him led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and taciturn
Enter Input : even with this old woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he was informed of the arrival of the “captain,” he at once refused
Enter Input : to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again. Samsonov
Enter Input : questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he was drunk?
Enter Input : Was he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that he was sober,
Enter Input : but wouldn’t go away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya,
Enter Input : who had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him,
Enter Input : wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: “On most important business
Enter Input : closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,” and sent it up to the old man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the
Enter Input : drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his
Enter Input : younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a man over
Enter Input : six foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven and
Enter Input : dressed in the European style, though his father still wore a kaftan and a
Enter Input : beard, came at once without a comment. All the family trembled before the
Enter Input : father. The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of
Enter Input : the “captain” (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order to
Enter Input : have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son and the
Enter Input : servant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It may be assumed
Enter Input : that he felt considerable curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya was
Enter Input : awaiting him was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on
Enter Input : the heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and
Enter Input : three immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fate
Enter Input : with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the opposite door,
Enter Input : seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long, military
Enter Input : stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat,
Enter Input : buttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his hands, just as he
Enter Input : had been three days before at the elder’s, at the family meeting with his
Enter Input : father and brothers. The old man waited for him, standing dignified and
Enter Input : unbending, and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and
Enter Input : through as he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov’s
Enter Input : immensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick, hung
Enter Input : down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in dignified silence,
Enter Input : motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his son’s arm he
Enter Input : began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so
Enter Input : that Mitya, seeing his painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and
Enter Input : sensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the
Enter Input : dignified person he had ventured to disturb.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it you want of me, sir?” said the old man, deliberately,
Enter Input : distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at once
Enter Input : speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive
Enter Input : frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of
Enter Input : ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old Samsonov
Enter Input : probably grasped all this in an instant, though his face remained cold and
Enter Input : immovable as a statue’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than once
Enter Input : of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed me
Enter Input : of my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossiping
Enter Input : about it ... for here every one’s gossiping of what they shouldn’t ... and
Enter Input : besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your
Enter Input : pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady
Enter Input : for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will not
Enter Input : reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of
Enter Input : it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mitya
Enter Input : purposely used these words instead of “intentionally”) consulted a lawyer
Enter Input : in the chief town of the province, “a distinguished lawyer, Kuzma
Enter Input : Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. You have perhaps heard of him? A
Enter Input : man of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ...
Enter Input : spoke of you in the highest terms ...” Mitya broke down again. But these
Enter Input : breaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled
Enter Input : on and on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting the
Enter Input : documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to
Enter Input : these documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste),
Enter Input : reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village
Enter Input : of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, from
Enter Input : his mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... “because
Enter Input : every door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.” In
Enter Input : fact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand
Enter Input : roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least,
Enter Input : twenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact,
Enter Input : “thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn’t get
Enter Input : seventeen from that heartless man!” So he, Mitya, had thrown the business
Enter Input : up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here was
Enter Input : struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift again
Enter Input : and again took a flying leap forward), “so will not you, excellent and
Enter Input : honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against that
Enter Input : unnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?... You
Enter Input : see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear
Enter Input : that. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of
Enter Input : three.” Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll do the business with you at a notary’s, or whatever it is ... in
Enter Input : fact, I’m ready to do anything.... I’ll hand over all the deeds ...
Enter Input : whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at
Enter Input : once ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that very
Enter Input : morning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn’t a
Enter Input : capitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ...
Enter Input : would save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action....
Enter Input : For I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you
Enter Input : know well, and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it
Enter Input : had not been as a father. And, indeed, it’s a struggle of three in this
Enter Input : business, for it’s fate—that’s a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy,
Enter Input : Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you’ve dropped out long ago, it’s a
Enter Input : tug-of-war between two. I’m expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I’m not
Enter Input : a literary man. You see, I’m on the one side, and that monster on the
Enter Input : other. So you must choose. It’s either I or the monster. It all lies in
Enter Input : your hands—the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse
Enter Input : me, I’m making a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from your
Enter Input : venerable eyes that you understand ... and if you don’t understand, I’m
Enter Input : done for ... so you see!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, “so you see!” and jumping up
Enter Input : from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the last
Enter Input : phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen
Enter Input : flat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it’s
Enter Input : nothing but nonsense.” The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.
Enter Input : All the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching
Enter Input : him with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment in
Enter Input : suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and
Enter Input : chilling tone:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, we don’t undertake such business.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” he muttered, with a pale smile. “I
Enter Input : suppose it’s all up with me—what do you think?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed a
Enter Input : movement in the old man’s face. He started.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, sir, business of that sort’s not in our line,” said the old man
Enter Input : slowly. “There’s the court, and the lawyers—it’s a perfect misery. But if
Enter Input : you like, there is a man here you might apply to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens! Who is it? You’re my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,” faltered
Enter Input : Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He doesn’t live here, and he’s not here just now. He is a peasant, he
Enter Input : does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He’s been haggling with
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya. They
Enter Input : can’t agree on the price, maybe you’ve heard? Now he’s come back again and
Enter Input : is staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the
Enter Input : Volovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse,
Enter Input : asking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if
Enter Input : you were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the
Enter Input : offer you’ve made me, he might possibly—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A brilliant idea!” Mitya interrupted ecstatically. “He’s the very man, it
Enter Input : would just suit him. He’s haggling with him for it, being asked too much,
Enter Input : and here he would have all the documents entitling him to the property
Enter Input : itself. Ha ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling
Enter Input : Samsonov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” cried Mitya effusively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t mention it,” said Samsonov, inclining his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you don’t know, you’ve saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment
Enter Input : brought me to you.... So now to this priest!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No need of thanks.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll make haste and fly there. I’m afraid I’ve overtaxed your strength. I
Enter Input : shall never forget it. It’s a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a
Enter Input : R-r-russian!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in the
Enter Input : old man’s eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself for
Enter Input : his mistrustfulness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s because he’s tired,” he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it’s for
Enter Input : her,” he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed, turned
Enter Input : sharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door without
Enter Input : looking back. He was trembling with delight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,” was
Enter Input : the thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a most
Enter Input : worthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then ...
Enter Input : then success was assured. He would fly off immediately. “I will be back
Enter Input : before night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done. Could the
Enter Input : old man have been laughing at me?” exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards
Enter Input : his lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was
Enter Input : practical “from such a business man” with an understanding of the
Enter Input : business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or—the
Enter Input : old man was laughing at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, when
Enter Input : the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing,
Enter Input : that he had made a fool of the “captain.” He was a cold, spiteful and
Enter Input : sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was the
Enter Input : “captain’s” excited face, or the foolish conviction of the “rake and
Enter Input : spendthrift,” that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull
Enter Input : story as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this
Enter Input : “scapegrace” had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which
Enter Input : worked on the old man, I can’t tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood
Enter Input : before him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and frantically
Enter Input : exclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him
Enter Input : with intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When
Enter Input : Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his son and
Enter Input : bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and never
Enter Input : admitted even into the yard, or else he’d—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him enraged,
Enter Input : trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shaking
Enter Input : with anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the doctor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. Lyagavy
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. He
Enter Input : had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many years
Enter Input : of prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had long
Enter Input : ceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who
Enter Input : had a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him six roubles for it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I didn’t expect that,” cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in a
Enter Input : state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home he
Enter Input : borrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him so much
Enter Input : that they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had. Mitya
Enter Input : in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided
Enter Input : that day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he had
Enter Input : put before Samsonov, the latter’s decision, his own hopes for the future,
Enter Input : and so on. These people had been told many of their lodger’s secrets
Enter Input : before, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud,
Enter Input : and almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya
Enter Input : sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This was how
Enter Input : the fact came to be remembered and established that “at midday, on the day
Enter Input : before the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he had sold his watch
Enter Input : to get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord, all in the
Enter Input : presence of witnesses.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at last
Enter Input : solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station, he
Enter Input : trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his absence.
Enter Input : What if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? This was
Enter Input : why he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with his
Enter Input : landlady not to let out where he had gone, if any one came to inquire for
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must, I must get back to-night,” he repeated, as he was jolted along in
Enter Input : the cart, “and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ...
Enter Input : to draw up the deed.” So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas!
Enter Input : his dreams were not fated to be carried out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station which
Enter Input : turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he did not
Enter Input : find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a neighboring
Enter Input : village. While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses,
Enter Input : was looking for him, it was almost dark.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at once
Enter Input : that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now at
Enter Input : Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the forester’s cottage,
Enter Input : as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya’s urgent request that he would
Enter Input : take him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing “save him, so to speak,” the
Enter Input : priest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his
Enter Input : curiosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on
Enter Input : foot, as it would not be “much over” a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed,
Enter Input : and marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost
Enter Input : ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously and
Enter Input : excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way. The
Enter Input : priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off Mitya’s
Enter Input : questions with: “I don’t know. Ah, I can’t say. How can I tell?” and so
Enter Input : on. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over his
Enter Input : inheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he was in some way
Enter Input : dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why
Enter Input : he called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained
Enter Input : to Mitya that, though the man’s name really was Lyagavy, he was never
Enter Input : called so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he
Enter Input : must be sure to call him Gorstkin, “or you’ll do nothing with him; he
Enter Input : won’t even listen to you,” said the priest in conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was
Enter Input : what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped the
Enter Input : subject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubt
Enter Input : whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy,
Enter Input : there was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into
Enter Input : ridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried,
Enter Input : striding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize
Enter Input : that they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three.
Enter Input : This annoyed him, but he controlled himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and
Enter Input : Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of the
Enter Input : passage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut was
Enter Input : extremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had gone out,
Enter Input : a tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and
Enter Input : some half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched
Enter Input : at full length on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a
Enter Input : pillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I’ve come in
Enter Input : such haste. I’m in a hurry to get back to-day,” he said in great
Enter Input : agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving
Enter Input : their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; he
Enter Input : tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s drunk,” Mitya decided. “Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I to
Enter Input : do?” And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by the
Enter Input : legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench.
Enter Input : Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting the
Enter Input : drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you’d better wait a little,” the priest pronounced at last, “for he’s
Enter Input : obviously not in a fit state.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s been drinking the whole day,” the forester chimed in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens!” cried Mitya. “If only you knew how important it is to me
Enter Input : and how desperate I am!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you’d better wait till morning,” the priest repeated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Till morning? Mercy! that’s impossible!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man
Enter Input : again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his
Enter Input : efforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,” said Mitya, in
Enter Input : complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The priest
Enter Input : seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even if he
Enter Input : succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and incapable of
Enter Input : conversation. “And your business is important,” he said, “so you’d
Enter Input : certainly better put it off till morning.” With a gesture of despair Mitya
Enter Input : agreed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. As
Enter Input : soon as he wakes I’ll begin. I’ll pay you for the light,” he said to the
Enter Input : forester, “for the night’s lodging, too; you’ll remember Dmitri Karamazov.
Enter Input : Only, Father, I don’t know what we’re to do with you. Where will you
Enter Input : sleep?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I’m going home. I’ll take his horse and get home,” he said,
Enter Input : indicating the forester. “And now I’ll say good-by. I wish you all
Enter Input : success.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester’s horse, delighted
Enter Input : to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering whether he ought
Enter Input : not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curious
Enter Input : incident, “or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw
Enter Input : his favor.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word,
Enter Input : and Mitya sat on the bench to “catch the favorable moment,” as he
Enter Input : expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist. A
Enter Input : profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach no
Enter Input : conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became
Enter Input : insufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured the
Enter Input : garden, the path behind the garden, the door of his father’s house
Enter Input : mysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a tragedy!” he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up to
Enter Input : the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle-aged
Enter Input : peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish
Enter Input : beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocket
Enter Input : of which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his face with
Enter Input : intense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly
Enter Input : irritated him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of such
Enter Input : importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn out, should
Enter Input : with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole
Enter Input : fate depended, while he snored as though there were nothing the matter, as
Enter Input : though he’d dropped from another planet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, the irony of fate!” cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he fell
Enter Input : again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of ferocity,
Enter Input : pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five minutes of vain
Enter Input : exertions, he returned to his bench in helpless despair, and sat down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stupid! Stupid!” cried Mitya. “And how dishonorable it all is!” something
Enter Input : made him add. His head began to ache horribly. “Should he fling it up and
Enter Input : go away altogether?” he wondered. “No, wait till to-morrow now. I’ll stay
Enter Input : on purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, I’ve no means of going. How
Enter Input : am I to get away from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously
Enter Input : dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours
Enter Input : or more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could
Enter Input : have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his
Enter Input : head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and
Enter Input : understand what had happened to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the
Enter Input : stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still
Enter Input : lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out,
Enter Input : and ran staggering across the passage into the forester’s room. The
Enter Input : forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of
Enter Input : fumes, to Mitya’s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange
Enter Input : unconcern, though he did go to see to it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he’s dead, he’s dead! and ... what am I to do then?” cried Mitya
Enter Input : frantically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought
Enter Input : a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then,
Enter Input : finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on
Enter Input : Lyagavy’s head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and
Enter Input : when he opened the window said grumpily:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’ll be all right, now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed about
Enter Input : the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravely
Enter Input : resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he sat
Enter Input : down for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciously
Enter Input : stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine o’clock.
Enter Input : The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. The
Enter Input : curly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on. He had
Enter Input : another samovar and another bottle in front of him. Yesterday’s bottle had
Enter Input : already been finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya
Enter Input : jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again,
Enter Input : hopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened
Enter Input : eyes. The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting
Enter Input : composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya
Enter Input : fancied. He rushed up to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, you see ... I ... you’ve most likely heard from the forester
Enter Input : here in the hut. I’m Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old
Enter Input : Karamazov whose copse you are buying.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a lie!” said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,” said the peasant, speaking
Enter Input : thickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and
Enter Input : collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote to
Enter Input : Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,” Mitya gasped breathlessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re l-lying!” Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya’s legs went cold.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For mercy’s sake! It isn’t a joke! You’re drunk, perhaps. Yet you can
Enter Input : speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re a painter!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For mercy’s sake! I’m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to
Enter Input : make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning
Enter Input : the copse!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The peasant stroked his beard importantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you’ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You’re a
Enter Input : scoundrel!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I assure you you’re mistaken,” cried Mitya, wringing his hands in
Enter Input : despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up his
Enter Input : eyes cunningly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D’you
Enter Input : hear? You’re a scoundrel! Do you understand that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly “something seemed to hit him on
Enter Input : the head,” as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in
Enter Input : his mind, “a light was kindled and I grasped it all.” He stood, stupefied,
Enter Input : wondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to
Enter Input : such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for
Enter Input : almost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, the man’s drunk, dead drunk, and he’ll go on drinking now for a
Enter Input : week; what’s the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here on
Enter Input : purpose? What if she—? Oh, God, what have I done?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might have
Enter Input : killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He went
Enter Input : quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, and
Enter Input : went out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next room; there
Enter Input : was no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocket
Enter Input : and put them on the table for his night’s lodging, the candle, and the
Enter Input : trouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all
Enter Input : round. He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut,
Enter Input : to the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with the
Enter Input : priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful feeling for
Enter Input : anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode along a narrow forest
Enter Input : path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he was going. A child could
Enter Input : have knocked him down, so weak was he in body and soul. He got out of the
Enter Input : forest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest,
Enter Input : stretched as far as the eye could see.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What despair! What death all round!” he repeated, striding on and on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across
Enter Input : country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and it
Enter Input : turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After some
Enter Input : discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. At
Enter Input : Volovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, and
Enter Input : suddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While the horses were
Enter Input : being harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an
Enter Input : instant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three
Enter Input : glasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He
Enter Input : flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and
Enter Input : “unalterable” plan to procure that “accursed money” before evening. “And
Enter Input : to think, only to think that a man’s life should be ruined for the sake of
Enter Input : that paltry three thousand!” he cried, contemptuously. “I’ll settle it
Enter Input : to-day.” And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what
Enter Input : might have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps have
Enter Input : become quite cheerful again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to
Enter Input : the heart every moment, like a sharp knife.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. Gold-Mines
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with
Enter Input : such horror. She was just then expecting the “message,” and was much
Enter Input : relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before.
Enter Input : She hoped that “please God he won’t come till I’m gone away,” and he
Enter Input : suddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him off her
Enter Input : hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov’s,
Enter Input : where she said she absolutely must go “to settle his accounts,” and when
Enter Input : Mitya accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making
Enter Input : him promise to come at twelve o’clock to take her home again. Mitya, too,
Enter Input : was delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting at Samsonov’s she
Enter Input : could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, “if only she’s not lying,” he
Enter Input : added at once. But he thought she was not lying from what he saw.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman,
Enter Input : at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to
Enter Input : her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken, heartbroken,
Enter Input : convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at the first glance
Enter Input : at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he revives at once,
Enter Input : lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his
Enter Input : jealousy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much
Enter Input : still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart, anyway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anything
Enter Input : happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch; ough!” floated through his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again in
Enter Input : his restless heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Jealousy! “Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,” observed Pushkin.
Enter Input : And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great
Enter Input : poet. Othello’s soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply
Enter Input : because _his ideal was destroyed_. But Othello did not begin hiding,
Enter Input : spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up,
Enter Input : pushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the
Enter Input : idea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible
Enter Input : to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous
Enter Input : man can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet it’s not as though
Enter Input : the jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of
Enter Input : lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet
Enter Input : hide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the
Enter Input : lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness—not incapable
Enter Input : of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it—though his soul was as
Enter Input : innocent and free from malice as a babe’s. It is not so with the really
Enter Input : jealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their
Enter Input : mind to and overlook, and what they can forgive! The jealous are the
Enter Input : readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man can
Enter Input : forgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violent
Enter Input : scene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved,
Enter Input : the very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be
Enter Input : convinced that it has all been “for the last time,” and that his rival
Enter Input : will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth,
Enter Input : or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that dreaded rival
Enter Input : will not get near her. Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour.
Enter Input : For, even if the rival did disappear next day, he would invent another one
Enter Input : and would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a love
Enter Input : that had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed
Enter Input : such strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never understand. And
Enter Input : yet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those
Enter Input : very men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and
Enter Input : spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though
Enter Input : they understand clearly enough with their “noble hearts” the shameful
Enter Input : depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya’s jealousy vanished, and, for an instant
Enter Input : he became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his
Enter Input : evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, there
Enter Input : was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that it
Enter Input : was not only a sensual passion, not only the “curve of her body,” of which
Enter Input : he had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began
Enter Input : to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no
Enter Input : sting of conscience at it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make
Enter Input : haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small,
Enter Input : temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his
Enter Input : expedition. And, as we all know, one can’t take a step without money. But
Enter Input : he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace
Enter Input : of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then
Enter Input : because he prized them above all his possessions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the “Metropolis” tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a
Enter Input : young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was
Enter Input : passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers,
Enter Input : hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself on
Enter Input : them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya,
Enter Input : without stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his
Enter Input : pistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to
Enter Input : persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent, so the
Enter Input : young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce him
Enter Input : to take interest. They parted friends.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch’s by the back way,
Enter Input : to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In this way
Enter Input : the fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event,
Enter Input : of which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for
Enter Input : ten roubles a possession he valued, though, three hours later, he was in
Enter Input : possession of thousands.... But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna
Enter Input : (the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch’s) he learned the very disturbing
Enter Input : fact of Smerdyakov’s illness. He heard the story of his fall in the
Enter Input : cellar, his fit, the doctor’s visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s anxiety; he heard
Enter Input : with interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning for
Enter Input : Moscow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,” thought Dmitri, but
Enter Input : he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. “What will happen now? Who’ll
Enter Input : keep watch for me? Who’ll bring me word?” he thought. He began greedily
Enter Input : questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before.
Enter Input : They quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completely
Enter Input : reassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the
Enter Input : night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He
Enter Input : would certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at
Enter Input : Samsonov’s gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here and
Enter Input : there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had to
Enter Input : carry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure
Enter Input : of its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to
Enter Input : sacrifice an hour to it: “In an hour I shall know everything, I shall
Enter Input : settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov’s. I’ll
Enter Input : inquire whether Grushenka’s there and instantly be back here again, stay
Enter Input : till eleven, and then to Samsonov’s again to bring her home.” This was
Enter Input : what he decided.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, and
Enter Input : went to Madame Hohlakov’s. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He had
Enter Input : resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he
Enter Input : felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. It
Enter Input : may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at
Enter Input : first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he
Enter Input : did not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how
Enter Input : to speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had
Enter Input : seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not
Enter Input : endure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the
Enter Input : desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the
Enter Input : “charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.”
Enter Input : Mitya’s manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had
Enter Input : once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was
Enter Input : uncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck
Enter Input : him: “If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna” (and he
Enter Input : knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) “why should she
Enter Input : refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and
Enter Input : get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their
Enter Input : hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice.
Enter Input : Besides, she’s so rich,” Mitya argued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for his “plan” it was just the same as before; it consisted of the
Enter Input : offer of his rights to Tchermashnya—but not with a commercial object, as
Enter Input : it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the
Enter Input : possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand—but simply as a
Enter Input : security for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted
Enter Input : with it, but so it always was with him in all his undertakings, in all his
Enter Input : sudden decisions. He gave himself up to every new idea with passionate
Enter Input : enthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov’s house he
Enter Input : felt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as
Enter Input : a mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke
Enter Input : down, nothing else was left him in the world, but to “rob and murder some
Enter Input : one for the three thousand.” It was half-past seven when he rang at the
Enter Input : bell.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced he
Enter Input : was received with extraordinary rapidity. “As though she were waiting for
Enter Input : me,” thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the drawing-room,
Enter Input : the lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she was
Enter Input : expecting him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I’d no reason to suppose
Enter Input : you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I did expect
Enter Input : you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was
Enter Input : convinced all the morning that you would come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That is certainly wonderful, madam,” observed Mitya, sitting down limply,
Enter Input : “but I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On a matter of
Enter Input : supreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and I
Enter Input : hasten—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you’ve come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; it’s
Enter Input : not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculous
Enter Input : (have you heard about Father Zossima?). This is a case of mathematics: you
Enter Input : couldn’t help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna;
Enter Input : you couldn’t, you couldn’t, that’s a mathematical certainty.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The realism of actual life, madam, that’s what it is. But allow me to
Enter Input : explain—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I’m all for realism now. I’ve seen
Enter Input : too much of miracles. You’ve heard that Father Zossima is dead?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, madam, it’s the first time I’ve heard of it.” Mitya was a little
Enter Input : surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Last night, and only imagine—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam,” said Mitya, “I can imagine nothing except that I’m in a desperate
Enter Input : position, and that if you don’t help me, everything will come to grief,
Enter Input : and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but
Enter Input : I’m in a fever—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know, I know that you’re in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, and
Enter Input : whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinking
Enter Input : over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying
Enter Input : it.... Oh, believe me, I’m an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I’m certainly an experienced
Enter Input : patient,” said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, “and I feel that if you
Enter Input : are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my
Enter Input : ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I
Enter Input : have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you.... I have
Enter Input : come, madam—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t explain it. It’s of secondary importance. But as for help, you’re
Enter Input : not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likely
Enter Input : heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, ‘had come to
Enter Input : grief,’ as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I
Enter Input : recommended him to take to horse-breeding, and now he’s doing well. Have
Enter Input : you any idea of horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!” cried Mitya, in
Enter Input : nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. “I simply implore
Enter Input : you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech that
Enter Input : I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have
Enter Input : come. Besides, I am short of time. I’m in a fearful hurry,” Mitya cried
Enter Input : hysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, and
Enter Input : hoping to cut her short. “I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of
Enter Input : despair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on
Enter Input : safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!
Enter Input : Only let me explain—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!” Madame Hohlakov with a
Enter Input : gesture demanded silence in her turn, “and whatever you may tell me, I
Enter Input : know it all beforehand; I’ve told you so already. You ask for a certain
Enter Input : sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I
Enter Input : will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya started from his seat again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam, will you really be so good!” he cried, with strong feeling. “Good
Enter Input : God, you’ve saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a
Enter Input : bullet.... My eternal gratitude—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!” cried Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya’s ecstasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Infinitely? But I don’t need so much. I only need that fatal three
Enter Input : thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite
Enter Input : gratitude, and I propose a plan which—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it’s said and done.” Madame Hohlakov cut him
Enter Input : short, with the modest triumph of beneficence: “I have promised to save
Enter Input : you, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What do you
Enter Input : think of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again.
Enter Input : I have been watching you for the last month. I’ve watched you a hundred
Enter Input : times as you’ve walked past, saying to myself: That’s a man of energy who
Enter Input : ought to be at the gold-mines. I’ve studied your gait and come to the
Enter Input : conclusion: that’s a man who would find gold.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From my gait, madam?” said Mitya, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, from your gait. You surely don’t deny that character can be told
Enter Input : from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. I’m all for
Enter Input : science and realism now. After all this business with Father Zossima,
Enter Input : which has so upset me, from this very day I’m a realist and I want to
Enter Input : devote myself to practical usefulness. I’m cured. ‘Enough!’ as Turgenev
Enter Input : says.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. “The
Enter Input : money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million,
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I’ll make you a present of the
Enter Input : idea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become a
Enter Input : leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave
Enter Input : it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all
Enter Input : sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of
Enter Input : railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You’ll become famous and indispensable to
Enter Input : the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The
Enter Input : depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;
Enter Input : people don’t know that side of me—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam, madam!” Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. “I shall
Enter Input : indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall
Enter Input : perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines.... I’ll come and see you again
Enter Input : about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so
Enter Input : generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... you
Enter Input : see, I haven’t a minute, a minute to lose to-day—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!” Madame Hohlakov interrupted
Enter Input : emphatically. “The question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; have
Enter Input : you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will go, madam, afterwards.... I’ll go where you like ... but now—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait!” cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsome
Enter Input : bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer
Enter Input : after another, looking for something with desperate haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The three thousand,” thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, “and at
Enter Input : the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that’s doing things
Enter Input : in gentlemanly style! She’s a splendid woman, if only she didn’t talk so
Enter Input : much!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here!” cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, “here is
Enter Input : what I was looking for!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the
Enter Input : skin with a cross.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” she went on reverently, “from
Enter Input : the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck myself,
Enter Input : and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it. In
Enter Input : extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last he got
Enter Input : it under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now you can set off,” Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down
Enter Input : triumphantly in her place again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam, I am so touched. I don’t know how to thank you, indeed ... for
Enter Input : such kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....
Enter Input : That sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity....
Enter Input : Oh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,” Mitya
Enter Input : exclaimed impulsively, “then let me reveal to you ... though, of course,
Enter Input : you’ve known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been
Enter Input : false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I’ve behaved
Enter Input : inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another woman
Enter Input : ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything
Enter Input : already, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three
Enter Input : thousand now—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov interrupted in
Enter Input : the most decisive tone. “Leave everything, especially women. Gold-mines
Enter Input : are your goal, and there’s no place for women there. Afterwards, when you
Enter Input : come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the
Enter Input : highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and
Enter Input : advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained
Enter Input : ground, and the new woman will have appeared.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam, that’s not the point, not at all....” Mitya clasped his hands in
Enter Input : entreaty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing
Enter Input : you’re yearning for, though you don’t realize it yourself. I am not at all
Enter Input : opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The
Enter Input : development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the
Enter Input : near future—that’s my ideal. I’ve a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : people don’t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author,
Enter Input : Shtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the
Enter Input : vocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two
Enter Input : lines: ‘I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.
Enter Input : Persevere.’ And I signed myself, ‘A Mother.’ I thought of signing myself
Enter Input : ‘A contemporary Mother,’ and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple
Enter Input : ‘Mother’; there’s more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And the
Enter Input : word ‘contemporary’ might have reminded him of ‘_The Contemporary_’—a
Enter Input : painful recollection owing to the censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the
Enter Input : matter!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Madam!” cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her in
Enter Input : helpless entreaty. “You will make me weep if you delay what you have so
Enter Input : generously—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That’s a noble feeling ...
Enter Input : such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later on
Enter Input : you will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on purpose
Enter Input : to share your joy with me—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But allow me, too!” Mitya cried suddenly. “For the last time I entreat
Enter Input : you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when may
Enter Input : I come for it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven’t got three thousand,” Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in my
Enter Input : hands—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you
Enter Input : misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It’s true I promised
Enter Input : you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, but
Enter Input : I was referring to the gold-mines.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But the money? The three thousand?” Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, if you meant money, I haven’t any. I haven’t a penny, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch. I’m quarreling with my steward about it, and I’ve just
Enter Input : borrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself. No, no, I’ve no money.
Enter Input : And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn’t give it to
Enter Input : you. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means losing
Enter Input : friends. And I wouldn’t give it to you particularly. I wouldn’t give it
Enter Input : you, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is the
Enter Input : gold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, the devil!” roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fist
Enter Input : down on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aie! Aie!” cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other end
Enter Input : of the drawing-room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of the
Enter Input : house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one possessed,
Enter Input : and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had struck himself
Enter Input : two days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he saw him in the dark,
Enter Input : on the road. What those blows upon his breast signified, _on that spot_,
Enter Input : and what he meant by it—that was, for the time, a secret which was known
Enter Input : to no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that
Enter Input : secret meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he had
Enter Input : determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay
Enter Input : his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast, from _that
Enter Input : spot on his breast_, the shame he carried upon it, that weighed on his
Enter Input : conscience. All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, but
Enter Input : now that his last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance,
Enter Input : burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs’
Enter Input : house. He walked on, and not knowing what he was doing, wiped away his
Enter Input : tears with his fist. In this way he reached the square, and suddenly
Enter Input : became aware that he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing
Enter Input : wail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good Lord, you’ve nearly killed me! Why don’t you look where you’re
Enter Input : going, scapegrace?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, it’s you!” cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. It
Enter Input : was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly
Enter Input : noticed the day before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And who are you, my good sir?” said the old woman, in quite a different
Enter Input : voice. “I don’t know you in the dark.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch’s. You’re the servant there?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch’s.... But I don’t know
Enter Input : you now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?” said Mitya,
Enter Input : beside himself with suspense. “I saw her to the house some time ago.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? Went away?” cried Mitya. “When did she go?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told Kuzma
Enter Input : Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re lying, damn you!” roared Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aie! Aie!” shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the
Enter Input : moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not more
Enter Input : than a quarter of an hour after her departure.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the
Enter Input : kitchen when “the captain” ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on
Enter Input : seeing him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You scream?” roared Mitya, “where is she?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fell
Enter Input : all of a heap at her feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fenya, for Christ’s sake, tell me, where is she?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don’t know. You may kill me
Enter Input : but I can’t tell you.” Fenya swore and protested. “You went out with her
Enter Input : yourself not long ago—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She came back!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Indeed she didn’t. By God I swear she didn’t come back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re lying!” shouted Mitya. “From your terror I know where she is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily.
Enter Input : But she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or she
Enter Input : might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and
Enter Input : old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar,
Enter Input : with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches
Enter Input : long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the
Enter Input : other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, Lord! He’s going to murder some one!” cried Fenya, flinging up her
Enter Input : hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. In The Dark
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Where was he running? “Where could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s?
Enter Input : She must have run straight to him from Samsonov’s, that was clear now. The
Enter Input : whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.” ... It all rushed whirling
Enter Input : through his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna’s. “There was no
Enter Input : need to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ...
Enter Input : they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the
Enter Input : plot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street,
Enter Input : then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at
Enter Input : the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle
Enter Input : fence of a neighbor’s kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence,
Enter Input : that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden. Here he chose a spot,
Enter Input : apparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he knew
Enter Input : Lizaveta had once climbed over it: “If she could climb over it,” the
Enter Input : thought, God knows why, occurred to him, “surely I can.” He did in fact
Enter Input : jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence.
Enter Input : Then he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in
Enter Input : the garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see the
Enter Input : lighted windows of the house too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, the old man’s bedroom is lighted up. She’s there!” and he leapt from
Enter Input : the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very likely
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he instinctively
Enter Input : hid himself, stood still, and began to listen. But there was dead silence
Enter Input : on all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not the
Enter Input : slightest breath of wind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And naught but the whispering silence,” the line for some reason rose to
Enter Input : his mind. “If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not.”
Enter Input : Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in the
Enter Input : garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creeping
Enter Input : stealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him five
Enter Input : minutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under the
Enter Input : window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam.
Enter Input : The door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut;
Enter Input : he had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached
Enter Input : the bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. “I must wait now,” he
Enter Input : thought, “to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are
Enter Input : listening ... if only I don’t cough or sneeze.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at moments,
Enter Input : he could scarcely breathe. “No, this throbbing at my heart won’t stop,” he
Enter Input : thought. “I can’t wait any longer.” He was standing behind a bush in the
Enter Input : shadow. The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How red the whitebeam berries are!” he murmured, not knowing why. Softly
Enter Input : and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and raised
Enter Input : himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch’s bedroom lay open before him. It
Enter Input : was not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen,
Enter Input : “Chinese,” as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word “Chinese”
Enter Input : flashed into Mitya’s mind, “and behind the screen, is Grushenka,” thought
Enter Input : Mitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his new
Enter Input : striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord
Enter Input : with tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with
Enter Input : gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his head
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has got himself up,” thought Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought.
Enter Input : Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing
Enter Input : went up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter
Enter Input : and drank it off. Then he uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a moment,
Enter Input : walked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand
Enter Input : raised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his
Enter Input : bruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s alone,” thought Mitya, “in all probability he’s alone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly to
Enter Input : the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she’s asleep by now,” he
Enter Input : thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the
Enter Input : window. “He’s looking for her out of the window, so she’s not there. Why
Enter Input : should he stare out into the dark? He’s wild with impatience.” ... Mitya
Enter Input : slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old
Enter Input : man was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put
Enter Input : his elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya
Enter Input : watched him eagerly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s alone, he’s alone!” he repeated again. “If she were here, his face
Enter Input : would be different.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she
Enter Input : was not here. “It’s not that she’s not here,” he explained to himself,
Enter Input : immediately, “but that I can’t tell for certain whether she is or not.”
Enter Input : Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally
Enter Input : clear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no
Enter Input : point. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision,
Enter Input : was growing in his heart with every instant. “Is she here or not?” The
Enter Input : angry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out
Enter Input : his hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the
Enter Input : old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times
Enter Input : more quickly, the signal that meant “Grushenka is here!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to
Enter Input : the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch opened
Enter Input : the window and thrust his whole head out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?” he said, in a sort of trembling
Enter Input : half-whisper. “Where are you, my angel, where are you?” He was fearfully
Enter Input : agitated and breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s alone.” Mitya decided.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where are you?” cried the old man again; and he thrust his head out
Enter Input : farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, right
Enter Input : and left. “Come here, I’ve a little present for you. Come, I’ll show
Enter Input : you....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He means the three thousand,” thought Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But where are you? Are you at the door? I’ll open it directly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the
Enter Input : right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the
Enter Input : darkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open the
Enter Input : door without waiting for Grushenka’s answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old man’s profile
Enter Input : that he loathed so, his pendent Adam’s apple, his hooked nose, his lips
Enter Input : that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by the
Enter Input : slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A horrible fury of
Enter Input : hatred suddenly surged up in Mitya’s heart: “There he was, his rival, the
Enter Input : man who had tormented him, had ruined his life!” It was a rush of that
Enter Input : sudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as though
Enter Input : foreseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to
Enter Input : Alyosha’s question, “How can you say you’ll kill our father?” “I don’t
Enter Input : know, I don’t know,” he had said then. “Perhaps I shall not kill him,
Enter Input : perhaps I shall. I’m afraid he’ll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that
Enter Input : moment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. I
Enter Input : feel a personal repulsion. That’s what I’m afraid of, that’s what may be
Enter Input : too much for me.” ... This personal repulsion was growing unendurable.
Enter Input : Mitya was beside himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his
Enter Input : pocket.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :                   -------------------------------------
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God was watching over me then,” Mitya himself said afterwards. At that
Enter Input : very moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in the
Enter Input : evening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described to
Enter Input : Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, very
Enter Input : strong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wife
Enter Input : repeated a “certain prayer” over him, after which he had gone to bed.
Enter Input : Marfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong
Enter Input : drink, slept like the dead beside her husband.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a moment’s
Enter Input : reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back, he sat up
Enter Input : in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhaps
Enter Input : his conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was
Enter Input : unguarded “in such perilous times.” Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay
Enter Input : motionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. “The stuff’s
Enter Input : been too much for the woman,” Grigory thought, glancing at her, and
Enter Input : groaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out
Enter Input : from the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and
Enter Input : his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not
Enter Input : locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the most
Enter Input : punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine,
Enter Input : and habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went
Enter Input : down the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open.
Enter Input : Mechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something,
Enter Input : perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master’s
Enter Input : window open. No one was looking out of it then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s it open for? It’s not summer now,” thought Grigory, and suddenly,
Enter Input : at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before
Enter Input : him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running
Enter Input : in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good Lord!” cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his
Enter Input : back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut,
Enter Input : evidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the
Enter Input : bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigory
Enter Input : followed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything. He
Enter Input : reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory
Enter Input : cried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two
Enter Input : hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he,
Enter Input : the “monster,” the “parricide.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Parricide!” the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could
Enter Input : hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck
Enter Input : by lightning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mitya’s
Enter Input : hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The
Enter Input : pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a
Enter Input : most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure
Enter Input : before him. The old man’s head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his
Enter Input : hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had
Enter Input : been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man’s
Enter Input : skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing
Enter Input : horribly; and in a moment Mitya’s fingers were drenched with the hot
Enter Input : stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white
Enter Input : handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man’s head, senselessly trying to wipe
Enter Input : the blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly
Enter Input : soaked with blood.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens! what am I doing it for?” thought Mitya, suddenly pulling
Enter Input : himself together. “If I have broken his skull, how can I find out now? And
Enter Input : what difference does it make now?” he added, hopelessly. “If I’ve killed
Enter Input : him, I’ve killed him.... You’ve come to grief, old man, so there you must
Enter Input : lie!” he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over it
Enter Input : into the lane and fell to running—the handkerchief soaked with blood he
Enter Input : held, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the
Enter Input : back pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met
Enter Input : him in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a
Enter Input : man running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov’s house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the
Enter Input : chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ’s sake, “not
Enter Input : to let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.” Nazar Ivanovitch
Enter Input : promised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him,
Enter Input : and meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from the
Enter Input : country, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention
Enter Input : “the captain.” Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly
Enter Input : recognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gate
Enter Input : at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humored
Enter Input : smile that “Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where is she then, Prohor?” asked Mitya, stopping short.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What for?” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That I can’t say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horses
Enter Input : were sent to fetch her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. A Sudden Resolution
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were both just
Enter Input : going to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselves
Enter Input : in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her by the throat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?” he roared
Enter Input : furiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both the women squealed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aie! I’ll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I’ll tell you
Enter Input : everything directly, I won’t hide anything,” gabbled Fenya, frightened to
Enter Input : death; “she’s gone to Mokroe, to her officer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What officer?” roared Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who threw her over
Enter Input : five years ago,” cackled Fenya, as fast as she could speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat. He stood
Enter Input : facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his eyes showed
Enter Input : that he realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed the whole
Enter Input : position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observe
Enter Input : whether he understood or not. She remained sitting on the trunk as she had
Enter Input : been when he ran into the room, trembling all over, holding her hands out
Enter Input : before her as though trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown
Enter Input : rigid in that position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably
Enter Input : upon him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared with
Enter Input : blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead with them,
Enter Input : wiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and his right cheek
Enter Input : were blood-stained patches. Fenya was on the verge of hysterics. The old
Enter Input : cook had jumped up and was staring at him like a mad woman, almost
Enter Input : unconscious with terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next to
Enter Input : Fenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken, benumbed.
Enter Input : Yet everything was clear as day: that officer, he knew about him, he knew
Enter Input : everything perfectly, he had known it from Grushenka herself, had known
Enter Input : that a letter had come from him a month before. So that for a month, for a
Enter Input : whole month, this had been going on, a secret from him, till the very
Enter Input : arrival of this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could
Enter Input : he, how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten this
Enter Input : officer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him? That was the
Enter Input : question that faced him like some monstrous thing. And he looked at this
Enter Input : monstrous thing with horror, growing cold with horror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child, he
Enter Input : began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he had
Enter Input : scared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning Fenya with an extreme
Enter Input : preciseness, astonishing in his position, and though the girl looked
Enter Input : wildly at his blood-stained hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness and
Enter Input : rapidity, answered every question as though eager to put the whole truth
Enter Input : and nothing but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sort
Enter Input : of enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to torment
Enter Input : him, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him. She
Enter Input : described the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin and
Enter Input : Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress had set
Enter Input : off, and how she had called out of the window to Alyosha to give him,
Enter Input : Mitya, her greetings, and to tell him “to remember for ever how she had
Enter Input : loved him for an hour.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush of
Enter Input : color on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him, not a bit
Enter Input : afraid now to be inquisitive:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They’re all over blood!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his hands and
Enter Input : at once forgot them and Fenya’s question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he had run in.
Enter Input : His first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed determination had
Enter Input : taken possession of him. He suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What has happened to you, sir?” said Fenya, pointing to his hands again.
Enter Input : She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very near to him now in his
Enter Input : grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s blood, Fenya,” he said, looking at her with a strange expression.
Enter Input : “That’s human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But ... Fenya ...
Enter Input : there’s a fence here” (he looked at her as though setting her a riddle),
Enter Input : “a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn to-morrow, when the
Enter Input : sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You don’t understand what
Enter Input : fence, Fenya, and, never mind.... You’ll hear to-morrow and understand ...
Enter Input : and now, good-by. I won’t stand in her way. I’ll step aside, I know how to
Enter Input : step aside. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka
Enter Input : Karamazov so for ever.... She always used to call me Mityenka, do you
Enter Input : remember?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was almost
Enter Input : more frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when he ran in
Enter Input : and attacked her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the young
Enter Input : official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by now half-past
Enter Input : eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening tea, and had just put
Enter Input : his coat on again to go to the “Metropolis” to play billiards. Mitya
Enter Input : caught him coming out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered a
Enter Input : cry of surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens! What is the matter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve come for my pistols,” said Mitya, “and brought you the money. And
Enter Input : thanks very much. I’m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of a
Enter Input : bundle of bank-notes in Mitya’s hand, and what was more, he had walked in
Enter Input : holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he had them
Enter Input : in his right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them.
Enter Input : Perhotin’s servant-boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that
Enter Input : he walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in
Enter Input : his hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in the
Enter Input : streets. They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and the
Enter Input : fingers holding them were covered with blood.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he said
Enter Input : that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have been
Enter Input : two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, “fat” bundle. “Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch,” so he testified afterwards, “seemed unlike himself, too;
Enter Input : not drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same
Enter Input : time, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for
Enter Input : something and unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste,
Enter Input : answered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all
Enter Input : dejected but quite cheerful.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what _is_ the matter with you? What’s wrong?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch,
Enter Input : looking wildly at his guest. “How is it that you’re all covered with
Enter Input : blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damnation! That’s the last straw,” he muttered angrily, hurriedly
Enter Input : changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively jerked
Enter Input : the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief turned out to be
Enter Input : soaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief he had used to wipe
Enter Input : Grigory’s face). There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not
Enter Input : merely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not
Enter Input : be pulled apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, damn it!” he said. “Haven’t you a rag of some sort ... to wipe my
Enter Input : face?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you’re only stained, not wounded? You’d better wash,” said Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch. “Here’s a wash-stand. I’ll pour you out some water.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A wash-stand? That’s all right ... but where am I to put this?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred-rouble
Enter Input : notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him to
Enter Input : decide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In your pocket, or on the table here. They won’t be lost.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that’s all
Enter Input : nonsense,” he cried, as though suddenly coming out of his absorption.
Enter Input : “Look here, let’s first settle that business of the pistols. Give them
Enter Input : back to me. Here’s your money ... because I am in great need of them ...
Enter Input : and I haven’t a minute, a minute to spare.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I shan’t have change enough. Haven’t you less?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No,” said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not trusting
Enter Input : his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, they’re all alike,” he added, and again he looked inquiringly at
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How have you grown so rich?” the latter asked. “Wait, I’ll send my boy to
Enter Input : Plotnikov’s, they close late—to see if they won’t change it. Here, Misha!”
Enter Input : he called into the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Plotnikov’s shop—first-rate!” cried Mitya, as though struck by an
Enter Input : idea. “Misha,” he turned to the boy as he came in, “look here, run to
Enter Input : Plotnikov’s and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings,
Enter Input : and will be there directly.... But listen, listen, tell them to have
Enter Input : champagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it was
Enter Input : to take to Mokroe. I took four dozen with me then,” he added (suddenly
Enter Input : addressing Pyotr Ilyitch); “they know all about it, don’t you trouble,
Enter Input : Misha,” he turned again to the boy. “Stay, listen; tell them to put in
Enter Input : cheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything,
Enter Input : everything they’ve got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty
Enter Input : as before.... But wait: don’t let them forget dessert, sweets, pears,
Enter Input : water-melons, two or three or four—no, one melon’s enough, and chocolate,
Enter Input : candy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before,
Enter Input : three hundred roubles’ worth with the champagne ... let it be just the
Enter Input : same again. And remember, Misha, if you are called Misha—His name is
Enter Input : Misha, isn’t it?” He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait a minute,” Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching him
Enter Input : uneasily, “you’d better go yourself and tell them. He’ll muddle it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for the
Enter Input : commission.... If you don’t make a mistake, there’s ten roubles for you,
Enter Input : run along, make haste.... Champagne’s the chief thing, let them bring up
Enter Input : champagne. And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I had then....
Enter Input : They know what I had then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But listen!” Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. “I say, let
Enter Input : him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and you go
Enter Input : and tell them.... Give him your note. Be off, Misha! Put your best leg
Enter Input : forward!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boy
Enter Input : remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently
Enter Input : understanding little of Mitya’s orders, gazing up with amazement and
Enter Input : terror at his blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers
Enter Input : that held the notes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, now come and wash,” said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. “Put the money on
Enter Input : the table or else in your pocket.... That’s right, come along. But take
Enter Input : off your coat.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look, your coat’s covered with blood, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That ... it’s not the coat. It’s only a little here on the sleeve.... And
Enter Input : that’s only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have soaked through.
Enter Input : I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya’s, and the blood’s come
Enter Input : through,” Mitya explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness that
Enter Input : was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been fighting
Enter Input : with some one,” he muttered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water.
Enter Input : Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands (they were trembling,
Enter Input : and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards). But the young official
Enter Input : insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more. He seemed
Enter Input : to exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on. It may be
Enter Input : noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look, you haven’t got your nails clean. Now rub your face; here, on your
Enter Input : temples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you going?
Enter Input : Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it’s all bloody,” observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his shirt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then change your shirt.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I haven’t time. You see I’ll ...” Mitya went on with the same confiding
Enter Input : ingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel, and putting on his
Enter Input : coat. “I’ll turn it up at the wrist. It won’t be seen under the coat....
Enter Input : You see!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting with
Enter Input : some one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating that
Enter Input : captain again?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully. “Whom have you been
Enter Input : beating now ... or killing, perhaps?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense!” said Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why ‘nonsense’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t worry,” said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. “I smashed an old
Enter Input : woman in the market-place just now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Smashed? An old woman?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An old man!” cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face,
Enter Input : laughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We made it up. We had a row—and made it up. In a place I know of. We
Enter Input : parted friends. A fool.... He’s forgiven me.... He’s sure to have forgiven
Enter Input : me by now ... if he had got up, he wouldn’t have forgiven me”—Mitya
Enter Input : suddenly winked—“only damn him, you know, I say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him!
Enter Input : Don’t worry about him! I don’t want to just now!” Mitya snapped out,
Enter Input : resolutely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ... Just
Enter Input : as you did with that captain over some nonsense.... You’ve been fighting
Enter Input : and now you’re rushing off on the spree—that’s you all over! Three dozen
Enter Input : champagne—what do you want all that for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I’ve no time now. I should
Enter Input : like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven’t the time. And
Enter Input : there’s no need, it’s too late for talking. Where’s my money? Where have I
Enter Input : put it?” he cried, thrusting his hands into his pockets.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had you forgotten?
Enter Input : Money’s like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are your pistols. It’s
Enter Input : an odd thing, at six o’clock you pledged them for ten roubles, and now
Enter Input : you’ve got thousands. Two or three I should say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three, you bet,” laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocket
Enter Input : of his trousers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The mines? The gold-mines?” Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and
Enter Input : went off into a roar of laughter. “Would you like to go to the mines,
Enter Input : Perhotin? There’s a lady here who’ll stump up three thousand for you, if
Enter Input : only you’ll go. She did it for me, she’s so awfully fond of gold-mines. Do
Enter Input : you know Madame Hohlakov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know her, but I’ve heard of her and seen her. Did she really give
Enter Input : you three thousand? Did she really?” said Pyotr Ilyitch, eyeing him
Enter Input : dubiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as Phœbus, ever young, flies
Enter Input : upwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this Madame Hohlakov,
Enter Input : and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not. Try and
Enter Input : find out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively, I
Enter Input : suppose she did give it to you. You’ve got the money in your hand, but
Enter Input : instead of going to Siberia you’re spending it all.... Where are you
Enter Input : really off to now, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Mokroe.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Mokroe? But it’s night!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Once the lad had all, now the lad has naught,” cried Mitya suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How ‘naught’? You say that with all those thousands!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! I’m talking of the
Enter Input : female character.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Fickle is the heart of woman
Enter Input :     Treacherous and full of vice;
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I agree with Ulysses. That’s what he says.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t understand you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Am I drunk?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not drunk, but worse.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But that’s enough!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you doing, loading the pistol?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m loading the pistol.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Unfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder horn, and
Enter Input : carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he took the bullet and,
Enter Input : before inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the candle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you looking at the bullet?” asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching him
Enter Input : with uneasy curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, would
Enter Input : you look at it or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why look at it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s going into my brain, so it’s interesting to look and see what it’s
Enter Input : like. But that’s foolishness, a moment’s foolishness. Now that’s done,” he
Enter Input : added, putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod. “Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch, my dear fellow, that’s nonsense, all nonsense, and if only you
Enter Input : knew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here’s some paper.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That’s right.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded the
Enter Input : paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He put the pistols
Enter Input : in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand. Then he looked at
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, let’s go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking of putting
Enter Input : that bullet in your brain, perhaps?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You may be
Enter Input : sure of that. I love golden-haired Phœbus and his warm light.... Dear
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by ‘stepping aside’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Making way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I hate. And to
Enter Input : let the one I hate become dear—that’s what making way means! And to say to
Enter Input : them: God bless you, go your way, pass on, while I—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “While you—?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough, let’s go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Upon my word. I’ll tell some one to prevent your going there,” said Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch, looking at him. “What are you going to Mokroe for, now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s a woman there, a woman. That’s enough for you. You shut up.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, though you’re such a savage I’ve always liked you.... I feel
Enter Input : anxious.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks, old fellow. I’m a savage you say. Savages, savages! That’s what I
Enter Input : am always saying. Savages! Why, here’s Misha! I was forgetting him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Misha ran in, post-haste, with a handful of notes in change, and reported
Enter Input : that every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs’; “They’re carrying down
Enter Input : the bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be ready directly.”
Enter Input : Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch, then tossed
Enter Input : another ten-rouble note to Misha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t dare to do such a thing!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch. “I won’t have it in
Enter Input : my house, it’s a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here, put
Enter Input : it here, why waste it? It would come in handy to-morrow, and I dare say
Enter Input : you’ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keep
Enter Input : putting the notes in your side-pocket? Ah, you’ll lose them!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say, my dear fellow, let’s go to Mokroe together.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What should I go for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say, let’s open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to drink,
Enter Input : and especially to drink with you. I’ve never drunk with you, have I?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well, we can go to the ‘Metropolis.’ I was just going there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I haven’t time for that. Let’s drink at the Plotnikovs’, in the back
Enter Input : room. Shall I ask you a riddle?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ask away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded it and
Enter Input : showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: “I punish myself for my
Enter Input : whole life, my whole life I punish!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will certainly speak to some one, I’ll go at once,” said Pyotr Ilyitch,
Enter Input : after reading the paper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Plotnikov’s shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one to
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch’s. It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by no
Enter Input : means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants. They kept everything
Enter Input : that could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, wines
Enter Input : “bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,” fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar,
Enter Input : and so on. There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always
Enter Input : employed. Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners
Enter Input : had gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished
Enter Input : as before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of
Enter Input : purchasers for their goods.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had vivid
Enter Input : recollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine and
Enter Input : goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for in
Enter Input : cash (they would never have let him have anything on credit, of course).
Enter Input : They remembered that then, as now, he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble
Enter Input : notes in his hand, and had scattered them at random, without bargaining,
Enter Input : without reflecting, or caring to reflect what use so much wine and
Enter Input : provisions would be to him. The story was told all over the town that,
Enter Input : driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had “spent three thousand in
Enter Input : one night and the following day, and had come back from the spree without
Enter Input : a penny.” He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped in our
Enter Input : neighborhood at the time), who for two days got money without stint out of
Enter Input : him while he was drunk, and drank expensive wine without stint. People
Enter Input : used to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he had given champagne to
Enter Input : grimy-handed peasants, and feasted the village women and girls on sweets
Enter Input : and Strasburg pies. Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a
Enter Input : risky proceeding, there was much laughter behind his back, especially in
Enter Input : the tavern, at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of
Enter Input : Grushenka by this “escapade” was “permission to kiss her foot, and that
Enter Input : was the utmost she had allowed him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cart
Enter Input : with three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, the
Enter Input : driver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the shop they had
Enter Input : almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were only
Enter Input : waiting for Mitya’s arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart. Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch was astounded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?” he asked Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here to the
Enter Input : shop. There’s no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but Timofey
Enter Input : now has gone on before me with the witch. Shall we be very late, Andrey?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’ll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe. I
Enter Input : got Timofey ready to start. I know how he’ll go. Their pace won’t be ours,
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They won’t get there an hour
Enter Input : earlier!” Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driver, wearing a
Enter Input : full-skirted coat, and with a kaftan on his arm, replied warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fifty roubles for vodka if we’re only an hour behind them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won’t be half an hour
Enter Input : before us, let alone an hour.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his orders
Enter Input : strangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began a
Enter Input : sentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to
Enter Input : come to the rescue.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Four hundred roubles’ worth, not less than four hundred roubles’ worth,
Enter Input : just as it was then,” commanded Mitya. “Four dozen champagne, not a bottle
Enter Input : less.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want with so much? What’s it for? Stay!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch.
Enter Input : “What’s this box? What’s in it? Surely there isn’t four hundred roubles’
Enter Input : worth here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first
Enter Input : box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only “the most
Enter Input : indispensable articles,” such as savories, sweets, toffee, etc. But the
Enter Input : main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off, as on the
Enter Input : previous occasion, in a special cart also with three horses traveling at
Enter Input : full speed, so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee and
Enter Input : fondants. The girls there are so fond of it,” Mitya insisted hotly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen of
Enter Input : champagne? One would be enough,” said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry. He
Enter Input : began bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to be
Enter Input : satisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles. In the end
Enter Input : it was agreed that only three hundred roubles’ worth should be sent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you may go to the devil!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second thoughts.
Enter Input : “What’s it to do with me? Throw away your money, since it’s cost you
Enter Input : nothing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This way, my economist, this way, don’t be angry.” Mitya drew him into a
Enter Input : room at the back of the shop. “They’ll give us a bottle here directly.
Enter Input : We’ll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for you’re a nice
Enter Input : fellow, the sort I like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with a
Enter Input : dirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagne
Enter Input : soon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen. “First-class
Enter Input : oysters, the last lot in.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hang the oysters. I don’t eat them. And we don’t need anything,” cried
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no time for oysters,” said Mitya. “And I’m not hungry. Do you
Enter Input : know, friend,” he said suddenly, with feeling, “I never have liked all
Enter Input : this disorder.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word,
Enter Input : that’s enough to make any one angry!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not what I mean. I’m talking of a higher order. There’s no order
Enter Input : in me, no higher order. But ... that’s all over. There’s no need to grieve
Enter Input : about it. It’s too late, damn it! My whole life has been disorder, and one
Enter Input : must set it in order. Is that a pun, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re raving, not making puns!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “Glory be to God in Heaven,
Enter Input :     Glory be to God in me....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That verse came from my heart once, it’s not a verse, but a tear.... I
Enter Input : made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain’s beard,
Enter Input : though....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all things are
Enter Input : made equal. That’s the long and short of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s all foolery, too! Drink, and don’t be fanciful. I love life. I’ve
Enter Input : loved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let’s drink to life, dear
Enter Input : boy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with myself? I’m a scoundrel,
Enter Input : but I’m satisfied with myself. And yet I’m tortured by the thought that
Enter Input : I’m a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself. I bless the creation. I’m
Enter Input : ready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I must kill one
Enter Input : noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others.... Let
Enter Input : us drink to life, dear brother. What can be more precious than life?
Enter Input : Nothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let’s drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet he
Enter Input : was melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy, overwhelming anxiety
Enter Input : were weighing upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Misha ... here’s your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink this
Enter Input : glass to Phœbus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you giving it him for?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “E—ech!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Misha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’ll remember it afterwards,” Mitya remarked. “Woman, I love woman! What
Enter Input : is woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad, Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? ‘I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas,
Enter Input : poor Yorick!’ Perhaps that’s me, Yorick? Yes, I’m Yorick now, and a skull
Enter Input : afterwards.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What dog’s that you’ve got here?” he asked the shopman, casually,
Enter Input : noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,” answered the clerk. “She
Enter Input : brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...” murmured Mitya dreamily, “only
Enter Input : that one had its hind leg broken.... By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted
Enter Input : to ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What a question!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I didn’t mean anything. From somebody’s pocket, you know. I don’t
Enter Input : mean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do,
Enter Input : too....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You go to the devil.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m talking of other people’s money. Stealing straight out of a pocket?
Enter Input : Out of a purse, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I took
Enter Input : it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, and what happened?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, and
Enter Input : gave it back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen something?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have,” said Mitya, winking slyly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What have you stolen?” inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and gave
Enter Input : it back three days after.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won’t you come now?” called Andrey from the door of
Enter Input : the shop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you ready? We’ll come!” Mitya started. “A few more last words
Enter Input : and—Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some brandy as well!
Enter Input : That box” (the one with the pistols) “put under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch, don’t remember evil against me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you’re coming back to-morrow?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Will you settle the little bill now?” cried the clerk, springing forward.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out three
Enter Input : hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of the
Enter Input : shop. Every one followed him out, bowing and wishing him good luck.
Enter Input : Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the
Enter Input : box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise
Enter Input : he saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him
Enter Input : with a cry, and plumped down at his feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don’t harm my
Enter Input : mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don’t murder him, he
Enter Input : came first, he’s hers! He’ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That’s why
Enter Input : he’s come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don’t take a
Enter Input : fellow creature’s life!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tut—tut—tut! That’s it, is it? So you’re off there to make trouble!”
Enter Input : muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. “Now, it’s all clear, as clear as daylight. Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a
Enter Input : man,” he shouted aloud to Mitya. “Do you hear, Dmitri?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I’ll throw them into the pool on the
Enter Input : road,” answered Mitya. “Fenya, get up, don’t kneel to me. Mitya won’t hurt
Enter Input : any one, the silly fool won’t hurt any one again. But I say, Fenya,” he
Enter Input : shouted, after having taken his seat. “I hurt you just now, so forgive me
Enter Input : and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it doesn’t matter if you
Enter Input : don’t. It’s all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full
Enter Input : speed!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,” Pyotr Ilyitch
Enter Input : thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the cart
Enter Input : packed with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they would
Enter Input : deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, he
Enter Input : turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s a fool, though he’s a good fellow,” he muttered as he went. “I’ve
Enter Input : heard of that officer, Grushenka’s former flame. Well, if he has turned
Enter Input : up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I’m not his nurse! Let them do
Enter Input : what they like! Besides, it’ll all come to nothing. They’re a set of
Enter Input : brawlers, that’s all. They’ll drink and fight, fight and make friends
Enter Input : again. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by ‘I’m
Enter Input : stepping aside, I’m punishing myself?’ It’ll come to nothing! He’s shouted
Enter Input : such phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he’s not
Enter Input : drunk. ‘Drunk in spirit’—they’re fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I
Enter Input : his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood. With
Enter Input : whom? I shall find out at the ‘Metropolis.’ And his handkerchief was
Enter Input : soaked in blood.... It’s still lying on my floor.... Hang it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game. The game
Enter Input : cheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly began telling one of
Enter Input : his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash
Enter Input : again—something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again
Enter Input : to spend it with Grushenka.... This news roused singular interest in his
Enter Input : listeners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity.
Enter Input : They left off playing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov’s present was received
Enter Input : with skepticism.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hasn’t he robbed his old father?—that’s the question.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three thousand! There’s something odd about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him, here.
Enter Input : And it was three thousand he talked about ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in his
Enter Input : answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya’s face and hands,
Enter Input : though he had meant to speak of it at first.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away.
Enter Input : But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for
Enter Input : billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he had
Enter Input : intended, he walked out of the tavern. When he reached the market-place he
Enter Input : stood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that what he
Enter Input : wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s and find out if anything had
Enter Input : happened there. “On account of some stupid nonsense—as it’s sure to turn
Enter Input : out—am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it,
Enter Input : is it my business to look after them?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya.
Enter Input : “Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,” he thought with
Enter Input : vexation, “I should have heard everything.” And the desire to speak to
Enter Input : her, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he was
Enter Input : half-way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where
Enter Input : Grushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock
Enter Input : in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no
Enter Input : one answered him; every one in the house was asleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I shall be making a fuss!” he thought, with a feeling of positive
Enter Input : discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking
Enter Input : again with all his might, filling the street with clamor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!” he muttered at each
Enter Input : knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on
Enter Input : the gate.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. “I Am Coming, Too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more
Enter Input : than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey’s three horses galloped at such a
Enter Input : pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. The
Enter Input : swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big
Enter Input : stars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the very
Enter Input : hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it
Enter Input : for ever and ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All was confusion, confusion, in Mitya’s soul, but although many things
Enter Input : were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning for
Enter Input : her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time.
Enter Input : One thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one instant.
Enter Input : I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt
Enter Input : not the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprung
Enter Input : out of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene, he would have
Enter Input : been jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with
Enter Input : blood again. But as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no
Enter Input : hostility even, for the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he
Enter Input : had not yet seen him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; this was
Enter Input : her first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she had
Enter Input : loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What right
Enter Input : have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is
Enter Input : over apart from the officer—even if he had not appeared, everything would
Enter Input : be over ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been
Enter Input : capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His present
Enter Input : plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya’s first words, it
Enter Input : had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its
Enter Input : consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion in
Enter Input : his soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace.
Enter Input : There was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him,
Enter Input : at moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death with
Enter Input : pen and paper: “I punish myself,” and the paper was lying there in his
Enter Input : pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next
Enter Input : morning, he would meet the first warm ray of “golden-haired Phœbus.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behind
Enter Input : and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought of it sank
Enter Input : into his heart with despair. There was one moment when he felt an impulse
Enter Input : to stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his loaded pistol,
Enter Input : and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn. But that
Enter Input : moment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on, “devouring space,”
Enter Input : and as he drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took
Enter Input : more and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful
Enter Input : images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon her, if
Enter Input : only for a moment, if only from a distance!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s now with _him_,” he thought, “now I shall see what she looks like
Enter Input : with him, her first love, and that’s all I want.” Never had this woman,
Enter Input : who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love in his
Enter Input : breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, a
Enter Input : feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her! “I will
Enter Input : efface myself!” he said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and though
Enter Input : Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter a word,
Enter Input : either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his three
Enter Input : lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible
Enter Input : anxiety:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Andrey! What if they’re asleep?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It may well be that they’re gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there ...
Enter Input : with such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep, perhaps,
Enter Input : there too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!” he cried, beside himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But maybe they’re not in bed!” Andrey went on after a pause. “Timofey
Enter Input : said they were a lot of them there—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At the station?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov’s, at the inn, where they
Enter Input : let out horses, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How’s that? Who are they?”
Enter Input : cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, Timofey was saying they’re all gentlefolk. Two from our town—who
Enter Input : they are I can’t say—and there are two others, strangers, maybe more
Enter Input : besides. I didn’t ask particularly. They’ve set to playing cards, so
Enter Input : Timofey said.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Cards?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So, maybe they’re not in bed if they’re at cards. It’s most likely not
Enter Input : more than eleven.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!” Mitya cried again, nervously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “May I ask you something, sir?” said Andrey, after a pause. “Only I’m
Enter Input : afraid of angering you, sir.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to
Enter Input : harm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sir— It’s I am
Enter Input : taking you there ... forgive me, sir, it’s my conscience ... maybe it’s
Enter Input : stupid of me to speak of it—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you a driver?” he asked frantically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, sir.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driver
Enter Input : who wouldn’t make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush
Enter Input : people? No, a driver mustn’t run over people. One can’t run over a man.
Enter Input : One can’t spoil people’s lives. And if you have spoilt a life—punish
Enter Input : yourself.... If only you’ve spoilt, if only you’ve ruined any one’s
Enter Input : life—punish yourself and go away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey was
Enter Input : surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you’re quite right, one mustn’t crush
Enter Input : or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is created
Enter Input : by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers,
Enter Input : drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To hell?” Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short laugh.
Enter Input : “Andrey, simple soul,” he seized him by the shoulders again, “tell me,
Enter Input : will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see, sir,
Enter Input : when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went straight
Enter Input : down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony.
Enter Input : And the devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no more
Enter Input : sinners in hell. And God said to him, then, ‘Don’t groan, for you shall
Enter Input : have all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and the
Enter Input : rich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I
Enter Input : come again.’ Those were His very words ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you see, sir, who it is hell’s for,” said Andrey, whipping up the left
Enter Input : horse, “but you’re like a little child ... that’s how we look on you ...
Enter Input : and though you’re hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your
Enter Input : kind heart.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What should I forgive you for, sir? You’ve never done me any harm.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will you
Enter Input : forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering to
Enter Input : himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let me
Enter Input : pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself,
Enter Input : do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love
Enter Input : Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there
Enter Input : I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to
Enter Input : the end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of
Enter Input : Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot
Enter Input : help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shall
Enter Input : fall before her and say, ‘You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell
Enter Input : and forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mokroe!” cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of
Enter Input : buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village of
Enter Input : Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were
Enter Input : asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Drive on, Andrey, I come!” Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’re not asleep,” said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to the
Enter Input : Plastunovs’ inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The six
Enter Input : windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’re not asleep,” Mitya repeated joyously. “Quicker, Andrey! Gallop!
Enter Input : Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I have
Enter Input : come. I’m coming! I’m coming, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and
Enter Input : pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed,
Enter Input : peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushed
Enter Input : up to the guest with obsequious delight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height,
Enter Input : with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising,
Enter Input : especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of assuming
Enter Input : the most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that it was to his
Enter Input : interest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on one
Enter Input : side, and a full-skirted coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was
Enter Input : for ever dreaming of improving his position. More than half the peasants
Enter Input : were in his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.
Enter Input : From the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which were
Enter Input : worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shake
Enter Input : off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of them was
Enter Input : already a widow and lived in the inn with her two children, his
Enter Input : grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman. Another of his
Enter Input : daughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of the
Enter Input : inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniature
Enter Input : photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes. The two
Enter Input : younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting
Enter Input : tight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when
Enter Input : they went to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as
Enter Input : usual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean
Enter Input : up after lodgers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch was
Enter Input : very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering that
Enter Input : not a month ago he had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not three
Enter Input : hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his escapade with
Enter Input : Grushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment
Enter Input : Mitya drove up to the steps.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,” began Mitya, “first and foremost, where is
Enter Input : she?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Agrafena Alexandrovna?” The inn-keeper understood at once, looking
Enter Input : sharply into Mitya’s face. “She’s here, too ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With whom? With whom?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from his
Enter Input : speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there’s another with
Enter Input : him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there’s no telling. They’re
Enter Input : dressed like civilians.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, are they feasting? Have they money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’re two gentlemen from the town.... They’ve come back from Tcherny,
Enter Input : and are putting up here. One’s quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.
Enter Input : Miüsov, he must be, but I’ve forgotten his name ... and I expect you know
Enter Input : the other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He’s been on a pilgrimage, so
Enter Input : he says, to the monastery in the town. He’s traveling with this young
Enter Input : relation of Mr. Miüsov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is that all?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of her?
Enter Input : How is she?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, she’s only just come. She’s sitting with them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I think she’s not laughing much. She’s sitting quite dull. She’s
Enter Input : combing the young gentleman’s hair.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Pole—the officer?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s not young, and he’s not an officer, either. Not him, sir. It’s the
Enter Input : young gentleman that’s Mr. Miüsov’s relation ... I’ve forgotten his name.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Kalganov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s it, Kalganov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right. I’ll see for myself. Are they playing cards?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They have been playing, but they’ve left off. They’ve been drinking tea,
Enter Input : the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I’ll see for myself. Now
Enter Input : answer one more question: are the gypsies here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can’t have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities have
Enter Input : sent them away. But we’ve Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the
Enter Input : village, so one might send for them. They’d come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Send for them. Certainly send for them!” cried Mitya. “And you can get
Enter Input : the girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, and
Enter Input : Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by now
Enter Input : they’re asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such
Enter Input : coarseness and rudeness! What’s the good of giving a peasant a cigar to
Enter Input : smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I’ll
Enter Input : get my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. They’ve only
Enter Input : just gone to bed, I’ll give them a kick and set them singing for you. You
Enter Input : gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e—ech!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hidden
Enter Input : half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked up
Enter Input : a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in his
Enter Input : clutches.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I was
Enter Input : here. Do you remember?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left three
Enter Input : thousand behind you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I’ve come to do the same again, do you see?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the
Enter Input : innkeeper’s nose.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, listen and remember. In an hour’s time the wine will arrive,
Enter Input : savories, pies, and sweets—bring them all up at once. That box Andrey has
Enter Input : got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagne
Enter Input : immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here, Andrey, let’s settle. Here’s fifteen roubles for the drive, and
Enter Input : fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... Remember
Enter Input : Karamazov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m afraid, sir,” faltered Andrey. “Give me five roubles extra, but more
Enter Input : I won’t take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish words
Enter Input : ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you afraid of?” asked Mitya, scanning him. “Well, go to the
Enter Input : devil, if that’s it!” he cried, flinging him five roubles. “Now, Trifon
Enter Input : Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, so
Enter Input : that they don’t see me. Where are they? In the blue room?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once obediently
Enter Input : did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went himself into the
Enter Input : first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, and
Enter Input : took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in, and put him in a
Enter Input : corner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the company without being
Enter Input : seen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he
Enter Input : saw her, his heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her, on
Enter Input : the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand and
Enter Input : seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at her, was
Enter Input : saying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of the
Enter Input : table, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at something. On
Enter Input : the sofa sat _he_, and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger.
Enter Input : The one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had
Enter Input : an impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was
Enter Input : apparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger, struck
Enter Input : Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. He
Enter Input : caught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put the
Enter Input : pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked, feeling cold
Enter Input : all over, straight into the blue room to face the company.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aie!” shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen,” he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering at
Enter Input : every word, “I ... I’m all right! Don’t be afraid!” he exclaimed,
Enter Input : “I—there’s nothing the matter,” he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who had
Enter Input : shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand tightly.
Enter Input : “I ... I’m coming, too. I’m here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with
Enter Input : you till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this same
Enter Input : room?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting on
Enter Input : the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and
Enter Input : observed severely:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panie_, we’re here in private. There are other rooms.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, it’s you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?” answered Kalganov
Enter Input : suddenly. “Sit down with us. How are you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a
Enter Input : lot of you.” Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out
Enter Input : his hand across the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aie! How tight you squeeze! You’ve quite broken my fingers,” laughed
Enter Input : Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He always squeezes like that, always,” Grushenka put in gayly, with a
Enter Input : timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya’s face that he was not
Enter Input : going to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity and
Enter Input : still some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him, and
Enter Input : indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and
Enter Input : speak like this at such a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good evening,” Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up to
Enter Input : him, too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good evening. You’re here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too!
Enter Input : Gentlemen, gentlemen, I—” (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe
Enter Input : again, evidently taking him for the most important person present.) “I
Enter Input : flew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, in
Enter Input : this very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,
Enter Input : _panie_,” he cried wildly, “I flew here and vowed— Oh, don’t be afraid,
Enter Input : it’s my last night! Let’s drink to our good understanding. They’ll bring
Enter Input : the wine at once.... I brought this with me.” (Something made him pull out
Enter Input : his bundle of notes.) “Allow me, _panie_! I want to have music, singing, a
Enter Input : revel, as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl
Enter Input : away, and there’ll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy on
Enter Input : my last night.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, but
Enter Input : strange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazed
Enter Input : fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at Grushenka,
Enter Input : and was in evident perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If my suverin lady is permitting—” he was beginning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What does ‘suverin’ mean? ‘Sovereign,’ I suppose?” interrupted Grushenka.
Enter Input : “I can’t help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what are
Enter Input : you talking about? Don’t frighten us, please. You won’t frighten us, will
Enter Input : you? If you won’t, I am glad to see you ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Me, me frighten you?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. “Oh, pass me
Enter Input : by, go your way, I won’t hinder you!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by
Enter Input : flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his head
Enter Input : away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chair
Enter Input : tight, as though embracing it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, come, what a fellow you are!” cried Grushenka reproachfully.
Enter Input : “That’s just how he comes to see me—he begins talking, and I can’t make
Enter Input : out what he means. He cried like that once before, and now he’s crying
Enter Input : again! It’s shameful! Why are you crying? _As though you had anything to
Enter Input : cry for!_” she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some
Enter Input : irritability.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ... I’m not crying.... Well, good evening!” He instantly turned round
Enter Input : in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh, but a
Enter Input : long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!” Grushenka said
Enter Input : to him persuasively. “I’m very glad you’ve come, very glad, Mitya, do you
Enter Input : hear, I’m very glad! I want him to stay here with us,” she said
Enter Input : peremptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words were
Enter Input : obviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. “I wish it, I wish it!
Enter Input : And if he goes away I shall go, too!” she added with flashing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What my queen commands is law!” pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing
Enter Input : Grushenka’s hand. “I beg you, _panie_, to join our company,” he added
Enter Input : politely, addressing Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another
Enter Input : tirade, but the words did not come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let’s drink, _panie_,” he blurted out instead of making a speech. Every
Enter Input : one laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!” Grushenka exclaimed
Enter Input : nervously. “Do you hear, Mitya,” she went on insistently, “don’t prance
Enter Input : about, but it’s nice you’ve brought the champagne. I want some myself, and
Enter Input : I can’t bear liqueurs. And best of all, you’ve come yourself. We were
Enter Input : fearfully dull here.... You’ve come for a spree again, I suppose? But put
Enter Input : your money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle of
Enter Input : notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed. In
Enter Input : confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At that
Enter Input : moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, and
Enter Input : glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so bewildered
Enter Input : that he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him and
Enter Input : poured out the champagne.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Another! Another bottle!” Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgetting
Enter Input : to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink to
Enter Input : their good understanding, he drank off his glass without waiting for any
Enter Input : one else. His whole countenance suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic
Enter Input : expression with which he had entered vanished completely, and a look of
Enter Input : something childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly
Enter Input : gentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a
Enter Input : continual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who
Enter Input : has done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten
Enter Input : everything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of
Enter Input : delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his
Enter Input : chair close up to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two
Enter Input : Poles, though he had formed no definite conception of them yet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his Polish
Enter Input : accent; and, above all, by his pipe. “Well, what of it? It’s a good thing
Enter Input : he’s smoking a pipe,” he reflected. The Pole’s puffy, middle-aged face,
Enter Input : with its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-looking
Enter Input : mustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not
Enter Input : even particularly struck by the Pole’s absurd wig made in Siberia, with
Enter Input : love-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples. “I suppose it’s all
Enter Input : right since he wears a wig,” he went on, musing blissfully. The other,
Enter Input : younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and
Enter Input : listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressed
Enter Input : Mitya by his great height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole on
Enter Input : the sofa. “If he stood up he’d be six foot three.” The thought flitted
Enter Input : through Mitya’s mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the
Enter Input : friend of the other, as it were, a “bodyguard,” and no doubt the big Pole
Enter Input : was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed
Enter Input : to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike
Enter Input : submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka’s mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely
Enter Input : failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart, was that she was
Enter Input : kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him sit by her. He was
Enter Input : beside himself with delight, watching her sip her glass of champagne. The
Enter Input : silence of the company seemed somehow to strike him, however, and he
Enter Input : looked round at every one with expectant eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don’t you begin doing
Enter Input : something?” his smiling eyes seemed to ask.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,” Kalganov began
Enter Input : suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s talking nonsense?” he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seeming
Enter Input : suddenly delighted at something—“ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry officers
Enter Input : in the twenties married Polish women. That’s awful rot, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Polish women?” repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalganov was well aware of Mitya’s attitude to Grushenka, and he guessed
Enter Input : about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him, perhaps did
Enter Input : not interest him at all; what he was interested in was Maximov. He had
Enter Input : come here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn for
Enter Input : the first time in his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once been
Enter Input : with some one to see her; but she had not taken to him. But here she
Enter Input : looked at him very affectionately: before Mitya’s arrival, she had been
Enter Input : making much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was a
Enter Input : boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charming
Enter Input : fair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair face
Enter Input : looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimes
Enter Input : even deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although the young man
Enter Input : sometimes looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed
Enter Input : of it, even when he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very
Enter Input : willful, even capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there was
Enter Input : something fixed and obstinate in his expression. He would look at you and
Enter Input : listen, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over something
Enter Input : else. Often he was listless and lazy, at other times he would grow
Enter Input : excited, sometimes, apparently, over the most trivial matters.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only imagine, I’ve been taking him about with me for the last four days,”
Enter Input : he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally though, without
Enter Input : the slightest affectation. “Ever since your brother, do you remember,
Enter Input : shoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That made me take an
Enter Input : interest in him at the time, and I took him into the country, but he keeps
Enter Input : talking such rot I’m ashamed to be with him. I’m taking him back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,”
Enter Input : the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended. If
Enter Input : he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I was married to a Polish lady myself,” tittered Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.
Enter Input : Were you a cavalry officer?” put in Kalganov at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!” cried Mitya, listening eagerly,
Enter Input : and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though there were
Enter Input : no knowing what he might hear from each.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you see,” Maximov turned to him. “What I mean is that those pretty
Enter Input : Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when
Enter Input : one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a
Enter Input : kitten ... a little white one ... and the _pan_-father and _pan_-mother
Enter Input : look on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes
Enter Input : and offers her his hand.... That’s how it is ... offers her his hand, he
Enter Input : he!” Maximov ended, tittering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and
Enter Input : crossed one leg over the other. Mitya’s eye was caught by his huge greased
Enter Input : boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles looked
Enter Input : rather greasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, now it’s _lajdak_! What’s he scolding about?” said Grushenka,
Enter Input : suddenly vexed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls,
Enter Input : and not ladies of good birth,” the Pole with the pipe observed to
Enter Input : Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can reckon on that,” the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes it
Enter Input : cheerful,” Grushenka said crossly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m not hindering them, _pani_,” said the Pole in the wig, with a long
Enter Input : look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe
Enter Input : again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.” Kalganov got excited
Enter Input : again, as though it were a question of vast import. “He’s never been in
Enter Input : Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you weren’t married in
Enter Input : Poland, were you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to Russia
Enter Input : before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and another
Enter Input : female relation with a grown-up son. He brought her straight from Poland
Enter Input : and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very nice
Enter Input : young man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he didn’t marry
Enter Input : her, because she turned out to be lame.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you married a lame woman?” cried Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. I
Enter Input : thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for fun.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So pleased she was going to marry you!” yelled Kalganov, in a ringing,
Enter Input : childish voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.
Enter Input : Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening,
Enter Input : she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. ‘I once jumped over
Enter Input : a puddle when I was a child,’ she said, ‘and injured my leg.’ He he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on the
Enter Input : sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, that’s the truth, he’s not lying now,” exclaimed Kalganov,
Enter Input : turning to Mitya; “and do you know, he’s been married twice; it’s his
Enter Input : first wife he’s talking about. But his second wife, do you know, ran away,
Enter Input : and is alive now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it possible?” said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an
Enter Input : expression of the utmost astonishment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. She did run away. I’ve had that unpleasant experience,” Maximov
Enter Input : modestly assented, “with a _monsieur_. And what was worse, she’d had all
Enter Input : my little property transferred to her beforehand. ‘You’re an educated
Enter Input : man,’ she said to me. ‘You can always get your living.’ She settled my
Enter Input : business with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: ‘One of your wives
Enter Input : was lame, but the other was too light-footed.’ He he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, listen!” cried Kalganov, bubbling over, “if he’s telling lies—and
Enter Input : he often is—he’s only doing it to amuse us all. There’s no harm in that,
Enter Input : is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He’s awfully low, but it’s
Enter Input : natural to him, eh? Don’t you think so? Some people are low from
Enter Input : self-interest, but he’s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he
Enter Input : was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_
Enter Input : about him. Do you remember, there’s a landowner called Maximov in it, whom
Enter Input : Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, ‘for inflicting bodily
Enter Input : injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.’ Would
Enter Input : you believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten!
Enter Input : Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the
Enter Input : beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don’t fit. He couldn’t have
Enter Input : been thrashed then, he couldn’t, could he?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his
Enter Input : excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, but if they did thrash him!” he cried, laughing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is—” put in
Enter Input : Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn’t.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What o’clock is it, _panie_?” the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall
Enter Input : friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders in
Enter Input : reply. Neither of them had a watch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn’t other people talk because
Enter Input : you’re bored?” Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding
Enter Input : fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya’s mind.
Enter Input : This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_, I didn’t oppose it. I didn’t say anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right then. Come, tell us your story,” Grushenka cried to Maximov.
Enter Input : “Why are you all silent?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s nothing to tell, it’s all so foolish,” answered Maximov at once,
Enter Input : with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. “Besides, all that’s by way
Enter Input : of allegory in Gogol, for he’s made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryov
Enter Input : was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, he
Enter Input : was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he wasn’t an
Enter Input : Italian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her
Enter Input : pretty little legs in tights, and she had a little short skirt with
Enter Input : spangles, and she kept turning round and round, only not for four hours
Enter Input : but for four minutes only, and she bewitched every one...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what were you beaten for?” cried Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For Piron!” answered Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Piron?” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big party
Enter Input : of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They’d invited me, and first of all
Enter Input : I began quoting epigrams. ‘Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!’ and
Enter Input : Boileau answers that he’s going to a masquerade, that is to the baths, he
Enter Input : he! And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another,
Enter Input : very sarcastic, well known to all educated people:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!
Enter Input :     But one grief is weighing on me.
Enter Input :     You don’t know your way to the sea!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly
Enter Input : way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I began
Enter Input : telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not accepted
Enter Input : into the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien,
Enter Input :     Pas même académicien.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They seized me and thrashed me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what for? What for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,” Maximov
Enter Input : concluded, briefly and sententiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Eh, that’s enough! That’s all stupid, I don’t want to listen. I thought
Enter Input : it would be amusing,” Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon his
Enter Input : feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his element,
Enter Input : began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands behind his back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, he can’t sit still,” said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously.
Enter Input : Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofa
Enter Input : was looking at him with an irritable expression.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panie!_” cried Mitya, “let’s drink! and the other _pan_, too! Let us
Enter Input : drink.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them with
Enter Input : champagne.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland!” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be delighted, _panie_,” said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity
Enter Input : and affable condescension, and he took his glass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the other _pan_, what’s his name? Drink, most illustrious, take your
Enter Input : glass!” Mitya urged.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Pan Vrublevsky,” put in the Pole on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Poland, _panovie!_” cried Mitya, raising his glass. “Hurrah!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three
Enter Input : glasses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now to Russia, _panovie_, and let us be brothers!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Pour out some for us,” said Grushenka; “I’ll drink to Russia, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So will I,” said Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!” tittered Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All! All!” cried Mitya. “Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table.
Enter Input : Mitya filled the glasses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Russia! Hurrah!” he shouted again. All drank the toast except the
Enter Input : Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did not
Enter Input : touch theirs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How’s this, _panovie_?” cried Mitya, “won’t you drink it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Russia as she was before 1772.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, that’s better!” cried the other Pole, and they both emptied their
Enter Input : glasses at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re fools, you _panovie_,” broke suddenly from Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panie!_” shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a
Enter Input : couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can one help loving one’s own country?” he shouted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be silent! Don’t quarrel! I won’t have any quarreling!” cried Grushenka
Enter Input : imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face glowed, her
Enter Input : eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just drunk were
Enter Input : apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, I’m sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_
Enter Input : Vrublevsky, I’m sorry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!” Grushenka scolded
Enter Input : with angry annoyance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Every one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,” Mitya began again, unable to make
Enter Input : anything of Grushenka’s words. “Come, why are we sitting here? What shall
Enter Input : we do ... to amuse ourselves again?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach, it’s certainly anything but amusing!” Kalganov mumbled lazily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let’s play faro again, as we did just now,” Maximov tittered suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Faro? Splendid!” cried Mitya. “If only the _panovie_—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s lite, _panovie_,” the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were
Enter Input : unwillingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true,” assented Pan Vrublevsky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lite? What do you mean by ‘lite’?” asked Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Late, _pani_! ‘a late hour’ I mean,” the Pole on the sofa explained.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s always late with them. They can never do anything!” Grushenka almost
Enter Input : shrieked in her anger. “They’re dull themselves, so they want others to be
Enter Input : dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning up
Enter Input : their noses at me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My goddess!” cried the Pole on the sofa, “I see you’re not well-disposed
Enter Input : to me, that’s why I’m gloomy. I’m ready, _panie_,” added he, addressing
Enter Input : Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Begin, _panie_,” Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket, and
Enter Input : laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. “I want to lose a lot to
Enter Input : you. Take your cards. Make the bank.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ll have cards from the landlord, _panie_,” said the little Pole,
Enter Input : gravely and emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s much the best way,” chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let’s get them from him.
Enter Input : Cards!” Mitya shouted to the landlord.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that the
Enter Input : girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would most
Enter Input : likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived.
Enter Input : Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders,
Enter Input : but only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did
Enter Input : not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told
Enter Input : them to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the
Enter Input : toffee and the fondants. “And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!” he
Enter Input : cried in haste. “I was rude to Andrey!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me five roubles,” he whispered to Mitya. “I’ll stake something at
Enter Input : faro, too, he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten
Enter Input : roubles. “And if you lose that, come again, come again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very good,” Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya,
Enter Input : too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had
Enter Input : already sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable,
Enter Input : almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was
Enter Input : preparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To your places, gentlemen,” cried Pan Vrublevsky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I’m not going to play any more,” observed Kalganov, “I’ve lost fifty
Enter Input : roubles to them just now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The _pan_ had no luck, perhaps he’ll be lucky this time,” the Pole on the
Enter Input : sofa observed in his direction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How much in the bank? To correspond?” asked Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s according, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much as
Enter Input : you will stake.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A million!” laughed Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Podvysotsky?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.
Enter Input : Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank.
Enter Input : The banker says, ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or
Enter Input : must we trust to your honor?’ ‘To my honor, _panie_,’ says Podvysotsky.
Enter Input : ‘So much the better.’ The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. ‘Take
Enter Input : it, _panie_,’ says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a
Enter Input : million. ‘Take it, _panie_, this is your gain.’ There was a million in the
Enter Input : bank. ‘I didn’t know that,’ says Podvysotsky. ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky,’ said
Enter Input : the banker, ‘you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.’ Podvysotsky took
Enter Input : the million.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not true,” said Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn’t say such things.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!” cried Mitya, but
Enter Input : checked himself at once. “Forgive me, _panie_, it’s my fault again, he
Enter Input : would, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You see
Enter Input : how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty little
Enter Input : _panienotchka_, he he!” laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, as
Enter Input : though trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up and crossed
Enter Input : himself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A corner!” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll bet another rouble, a ‘single’ stake,” Maximov muttered gleefully,
Enter Input : hugely delighted at having won a rouble.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lost!” shouted Mitya. “A ‘double’ on the seven!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The seven too was trumped.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop!” cried Kalganov suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Double! Double!” Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled the
Enter Input : stake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakes
Enter Input : kept winning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On the double!” shouted Mitya furiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve lost two hundred, _panie_. Will you stake another hundred?” the
Enter Input : Pole on the sofa inquired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling two
Enter Input : hundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough!” he shouted in his ringing voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter?” Mitya stared at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough! I don’t want you to play any more. Don’t!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Because I don’t. Hang it, come away. That’s why. I won’t let you go on
Enter Input : playing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya gazed at him in astonishment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You’ve lost a lot as it is,” said
Enter Input : Grushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose from
Enter Input : their seats with a deeply offended air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you joking, _panie_?” said the short man, looking severely at
Enter Input : Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How dare you!” Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t dare to shout like that,” cried Grushenka. “Ah, you turkey-cocks!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka’s face
Enter Input : suddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed into
Enter Input : his mind—a strange new thought!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrippina,” the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger,
Enter Input : when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Most illustrious, two words with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the next room, I’ve two words to say to you, something pleasant, very
Enter Input : pleasant. You’ll be glad to hear it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The little _pan_ was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He
Enter Input : agreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!” cried
Enter Input : Mitya. “March, _panovie_!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where are you going?” asked Grushenka, anxiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ll be back in one moment,” answered Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes. His
Enter Input : face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was
Enter Input : assembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the
Enter Input : right, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two large
Enter Input : beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candle
Enter Input : on a small deal table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down to
Enter Input : this table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside
Enter Input : them, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but were
Enter Input : evidently inquisitive.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What can I do for you, _panie_?” lisped the little Pole.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, look here, _panie_, I won’t keep you long. There’s money for you,”
Enter Input : he pulled out his notes. “Would you like three thousand? Take it and go
Enter Input : your way.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three thousand, _panie_?” He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three, _panovie_, three! Listen, _panie_, I see you’re a sensible man.
Enter Input : Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you—d’you
Enter Input : hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that,
Enter Input : _panie_, for ever. Here’s the door, you go out of it. What have you got
Enter Input : there, a great-coat, a fur coat? I’ll bring it out to you. They’ll get the
Enter Input : horses out directly, and then—good-by, _panie_!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression of
Enter Input : extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole’s face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the money, _panie_?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The money, _panie_? Five hundred roubles I’ll give you this moment for
Enter Input : the journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred
Enter Input : to-morrow, in the town—I swear on my honor, I’ll get it, I’ll get it at
Enter Input : any cost!” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Poles exchanged glances again. The short man’s face looked more
Enter Input : forbidding.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute,
Enter Input : cash down!” Mitya added, feeling something wrong. “What’s the matter,
Enter Input : _panie_? Don’t you trust me? I can’t give you the whole three thousand
Enter Input : straight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to-morrow....
Enter Input : Besides, I haven’t the three thousand with me. I’ve got it at home in the
Enter Input : town,” faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. “Upon
Enter Input : my word, the money’s there, hidden.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in
Enter Input : the little man’s face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What next?” he asked ironically. “For shame!” and he spat on the floor.
Enter Input : Pan Vrublevsky spat too.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You do that, _panie_,” said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was
Enter Input : over, “because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You’re a couple of
Enter Input : capons, that’s what you are!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is a mortal insult!” The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he
Enter Input : went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word.
Enter Input : Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and
Enter Input : crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the _pan_ would at
Enter Input : once raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the room
Enter Input : and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!” he exclaimed. But
Enter Input : Grushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her in
Enter Input : the tenderest spot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak Russian! Speak Russian!” she cried, “not another word of Polish!
Enter Input : You used to talk Russian. You can’t have forgotten it in five years.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was red with passion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrippina—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My name’s Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won’t listen!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered
Enter Input : himself in broken Russian:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forget
Enter Input : all that has happened till to-day—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive? Came here to forgive me?” Grushenka cut him short, jumping up
Enter Input : from her seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just so, _pani_, I’m not pusillanimous, I’m magnanimous. But I was
Enter Input : astounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in
Enter Input : the other room to depart. I spat in the _pan’s_ face.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What? He offered you money for me?” cried Grushenka, hysterically. “Is it
Enter Input : true, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Panie, panie!_” yelled Mitya, “she’s pure and shining, and I have never
Enter Input : been her lover! That’s a lie....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How dare you defend me to him?” shrieked Grushenka. “It wasn’t virtue
Enter Input : kept me pure, and it wasn’t that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might
Enter Input : hold up my head when I met him, and tell him he’s a scoundrel. And he did
Enter Input : actually refuse the money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He took it! He took it!” cried Mitya; “only he wanted to get the whole
Enter Input : three thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred straight
Enter Input : off.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_ Agrippina!” cried the little Pole. “I’m—a knight, I’m—a nobleman,
Enter Input : and not a _lajdak_. I came here to make you my wife and I find you a
Enter Input : different woman, perverse and shameless.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, go back where you came from! I’ll tell them to turn you out and
Enter Input : you’ll be turned out,” cried Grushenka, furious. “I’ve been a fool, a
Enter Input : fool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn’t for his sake,
Enter Input : it was my anger made me miserable. And this isn’t he at all! Was he like
Enter Input : this? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He was a
Enter Input : falcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to me.... And I’ve
Enter Input : been crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At that
Enter Input : instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left—a
Enter Input : rollicking dance song.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A regular Sodom!” Vrublevsky roared suddenly. “Landlord, send the
Enter Input : shameless hussies away!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at
Enter Input : the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling, at
Enter Input : once entered the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you shouting for? D’you want to split your throat?” he said,
Enter Input : addressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Animal!” bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave you
Enter Input : a pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send you to
Enter Input : Siberia for playing with false cards, d’you know that, for it’s just the
Enter Input : same as false banknotes....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and
Enter Input : the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here’s my pack unopened!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He held it up and showed it to all in the room. “From where I stood I saw
Enter Input : him slip my pack away, and put his in place of it—you’re a cheat and not a
Enter Input : gentleman!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I twice saw the _pan_ change a card!” cried Kalganov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How shameful! How shameful!” exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, and
Enter Input : blushing for genuine shame. “Good Lord, he’s come to that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thought so, too!” said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words,
Enter Input : Vrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at
Enter Input : Grushenka, shouting:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You low harlot!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in the
Enter Input : air, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right, from
Enter Input : which they had just come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve laid him on the floor, there,” he announced, returning at once,
Enter Input : gasping with excitement. “He’s struggling, the scoundrel! But he won’t
Enter Input : come back, no fear of that!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called
Enter Input : out to the little Pole:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said Trifon Borissovitch, “make them give
Enter Input : you back the money you lost. It’s as good as stolen from you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want my fifty roubles back,” Kalganov declared suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want my two hundred, either,” cried Mitya, “I wouldn’t take it
Enter Input : for anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo, Mitya! You’re a trump, Mitya!” cried Grushenka, and there was a
Enter Input : note of fierce anger in the exclamation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The little _pan_, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity, was
Enter Input : making for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressing
Enter Input : Grushenka:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Pani_, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This was
Enter Input : a man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after all
Enter Input : that had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya slammed
Enter Input : the door after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lock it,” said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they had
Enter Input : locked it from within.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s capital!” exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. “Serve them right!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. Delirium
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.
Enter Input : Grushenka was the first to call for wine.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before. Do you
Enter Input : remember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was at
Enter Input : hand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, ‘let the stove
Enter Input : and cottage dance’; as we had it last time,” she kept exclaiming. She was
Enter Input : tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her. The chorus were in
Enter Input : the next room. The room in which they had been sitting till that moment
Enter Input : was too small, and was divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which was
Enter Input : a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows.
Enter Input : In the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herself
Enter Input : just at the door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had sat in the same
Enter Input : place to watch the dancing and singing “the time before,” when they had
Enter Input : made merry there. All the girls who had come had been there then; the
Enter Input : Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and at last the long
Enter Input : expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the room to
Enter Input : look on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep and
Enter Input : attracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they had
Enter Input : enjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting and
Enter Input : embracing every one he knew. He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for
Enter Input : every one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for the
Enter Input : champagne. The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mitya
Enter Input : had chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars
Enter Input : should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to
Enter Input : help himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his natural
Enter Input : element, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits rose. If the
Enter Input : peasants had asked him for money at that moment, he would have pulled out
Enter Input : his notes and given them away right and left. This was probably why the
Enter Input : landlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him.
Enter Input : He seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but he
Enter Input : drank little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on
Enter Input : Mitya’s interests after his own fashion. He intervened in the nick of
Enter Input : time, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away “cigars
Enter Input : and Rhine wine,” and, above all, money to the peasants as he had done
Enter Input : before. He was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur,
Enter Input : and eating sweets.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’re a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” he said. “I’d give them a
Enter Input : kick, every one of them, and they’d take it as an honor—that’s all they’re
Enter Input : worth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him. “I
Enter Input : was rude to him just now,” he repeated with a sinking, softened voice.
Enter Input : Kalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for the girls’
Enter Input : singing; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became
Enter Input : extraordinarily lively, strolling about the room, laughing and praising
Enter Input : the music and the songs, admiring every one and everything. Maximov,
Enter Input : blissfully drunk, never left his side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to
Enter Input : get drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to Mitya:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What a dear, charming boy he is!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were his
Enter Input : hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to refrain
Enter Input : from speaking. But she looked at him from time to time with caressing and
Enter Input : passionate eyes. At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him
Enter Input : vigorously to her. She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the
Enter Input : door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!... I was
Enter Input : frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you really
Enter Input : want to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I didn’t want to spoil your happiness!” Mitya faltered blissfully. But
Enter Input : she did not need his answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, go and enjoy yourself ...” she sent him away once more. “Don’t cry,
Enter Input : I’ll call you back again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked at the
Enter Input : dancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in another
Enter Input : quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run
Enter Input : back to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my coming
Enter Input : here yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,
Enter Input : feverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you frowning at?” she asked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I’d give ten years of my life for him
Enter Input : to get well, to know he was all right!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, never mind him, if he’s ill. So you meant to shoot yourself
Enter Input : to-morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows as
Enter Input : you,” she lisped, with a rather halting tongue. “So you would go any
Enter Input : length for me, eh? Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow, you
Enter Input : stupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow I may have something to say to
Enter Input : you.... I won’t say it to-day, but to-morrow. You’d like it to be to-day?
Enter Input : No, I don’t want to to-day. Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Once, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you sad? I see you’re sad.... Yes, I see it,” she added, looking
Enter Input : intently into his eyes. “Though you keep kissing the peasants and
Enter Input : shouting, I see something. No, be merry. I’m merry; you be merry, too....
Enter Input : I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep,
Enter Input : poor dear, he’s drunk.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for a
Enter Input : moment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink; he
Enter Input : felt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, “bored.” He was intensely
Enter Input : depressed by the girls’ songs, which, as the drinking went on, gradually
Enter Input : became coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad. Two girls
Enter Input : dressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in
Enter Input : her hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to “show them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look alive, Marya, or you’ll get the stick!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amid
Enter Input : roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, let them! Let them!” said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstatic
Enter Input : expression on her face. “When they do get a day to enjoy themselves, why
Enter Input : shouldn’t folks be happy?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s swinish, all this peasant foolery,” he murmured, moving away; “it’s
Enter Input : the game they play when it’s light all night in summer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He particularly disliked one “new” song to a jaunty dance-tune. It
Enter Input : described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to see
Enter Input : whether they would love him:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The master came to try the girls:
Enter Input :     Would they love him, would they not?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the girls could not love the master:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     He would beat me cruelly
Enter Input :     And such love won’t do for me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The gypsy came to try the girls:
Enter Input :     Would they love him, would they not?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But they couldn’t love the gypsy either:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     He would be a thief, I fear,
Enter Input :     And would cause me many a tear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The soldier came to try the girls:
Enter Input :     Would they love him, would they not?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung
Enter Input : with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The song
Enter Input : ends with a merchant:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The merchant came to try the girls:
Enter Input :     Would they love him, would they not?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And it appears that he wins their love because:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The merchant will make gold for me
Enter Input :     And his queen I’ll gladly be.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalvanov was positively indignant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just a song of yesterday,” he said aloud. “Who writes such things
Enter Input : for them? They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to
Enter Input : try his luck with the girls; they’d have carried all before them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on the
Enter Input : spot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.
Enter Input : His pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on the sofa
Enter Input : cushion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look how pretty he is,” said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him. “I was
Enter Input : combing his hair just now; his hair’s like flax, and so thick....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganov
Enter Input : instantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with the most
Enter Input : anxious air inquired where was Maximov?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So that’s who it is you want.” Grushenka laughed. “Stay with me a minute.
Enter Input : Mitya, run and find his Maximov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Maximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, only
Enter Input : running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur. He
Enter Input : had drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was red, and his nose was
Enter Input : crimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet. He ran up and announced
Enter Input : that he was going to dance the “sabotière.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I was
Enter Input : little....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go, go with him, Mitya, and I’ll watch from here how he dances,” said
Enter Input : Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, I’m coming to look on, too,” exclaimed Kalganov, brushing aside
Enter Input : in the most naïve way Grushenka’s offer to sit with him. They all went to
Enter Input : look on. Maximov danced his dance. But it roused no great admiration in
Enter Input : any one but Mitya. It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping,
Enter Input : kicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole
Enter Input : of his foot. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks. You’re tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would you
Enter Input : like some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A cigarette.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t you want a drink?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, there’s a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my dear
Enter Input : soul!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, brother, we’ve none of that special sort.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say,” the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya’s ear. “That girl
Enter Input : there, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to help me make
Enter Input : friends with her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So that’s what you’re after! No, brother, that won’t do!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’d do no harm to any one,” Maximov muttered disconsolately.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, you
Enter Input : know, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be merry,
Enter Input : meanwhile. Don’t you want money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Later on, perhaps,” smiled Maximov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right, all right....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya’s head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony which ran
Enter Input : round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the courtyard. The
Enter Input : fresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark corner, and suddenly
Enter Input : clutched his head in both hands. His scattered thoughts came together; his
Enter Input : sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind. A
Enter Input : fearful and terrible light! “If I’m to shoot myself, why not now?” passed
Enter Input : through his mind. “Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here,
Enter Input : in this dark dirty corner, make an end?” Almost a minute he stood,
Enter Input : undecided. A few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he was
Enter Input : pursued by disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that blood, that
Enter Input : blood!... But yet it was easier for him then. Then everything was over: he
Enter Input : had lost her, given her up. She was gone, for him—oh, then his death
Enter Input : sentence had been easier for him; at least it had seemed necessary,
Enter Input : inevitable, for what had he to stay on earth for?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at least was
Enter Input : at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had vanished,
Enter Input : leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had turned into something so small,
Enter Input : so comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in. It would
Enter Input : never return. She was ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom she
Enter Input : loved. Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go on
Enter Input : living, he could not; oh, damnation! “O God! restore to life the man I
Enter Input : knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me! Lord, thou
Enter Input : hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the old
Enter Input : man’s alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away. I
Enter Input : would restore the stolen money. I’d give it back; I’d get it somehow....
Enter Input : No trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever! But no,
Enter Input : no; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped up and
Enter Input : ran back to the room—to her, to her, his queen for ever! Was not one
Enter Input : moment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies of
Enter Input : disgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart. “To her, to her alone,
Enter Input : to see her, to hear her, to think of nothing, to forget everything, if
Enter Input : only for that night, for an hour, for a moment!” Just as he turned from
Enter Input : the balcony into the passage, he came upon the landlord, Trifon
Enter Input : Borissovitch. He thought he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had
Enter Input : come to find him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, sir.” The landlord seemed disconcerted. “Why should I be looking for
Enter Input : you? Where have you been?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you look so glum? You’re not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you shall
Enter Input : soon get to bed.... What’s the time?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’ll be three o’clock. Past three, it must be.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ll leave off soon. We’ll leave off.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t mention it; it doesn’t matter. Keep it up as long as you like....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter with him?” Mitya wondered for an instant, and he ran
Enter Input : back to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was not there. She
Enter Input : was not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov asleep on
Enter Input : the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain—she was there. She was sitting
Enter Input : in the corner, on a trunk. Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bed
Enter Input : close by, she was crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs
Enter Input : that she might not be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and
Enter Input : when he ran to her, she grasped his hand tightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these five
Enter Input : years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him, him!
Enter Input : It’s a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was only
Enter Input : seventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to me....
Enter Input : Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it’s not the
Enter Input : same man. Even his face is not the same; he’s different altogether. I
Enter Input : shouldn’t have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was
Enter Input : thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we should
Enter Input : look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as
Enter Input : though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to me like
Enter Input : a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so solemnly that I was
Enter Input : struck dumb. I couldn’t get a word in. At first I thought he was ashamed
Enter Input : to talk before his great big Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why
Enter Input : I couldn’t say a word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined
Enter Input : him; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed him
Enter Input : like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed
Enter Input : for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya’s hand and did
Enter Input : not let it go.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, darling, stay, don’t go away. I want to say one word to you,” she
Enter Input : whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. “Listen, tell me who it is
Enter Input : I love? I love one man here. Who is that man? That’s what you must tell
Enter Input : me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and her eyes
Enter Input : shone in the half darkness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. ‘Fool! that’s the man you love!’
Enter Input : That was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in and all grew
Enter Input : bright. What’s he afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened; you
Enter Input : couldn’t speak. It’s not them he’s afraid of—could you be frightened of
Enter Input : any one? It’s me he’s afraid of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you,
Enter Input : you little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I’d
Enter Input : loved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another.
Enter Input : Mitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one
Enter Input : after you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love
Enter Input : me? Do you love me?” She jumped up and held him with both hands on his
Enter Input : shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her eyes, at her face, at
Enter Input : her smile, and suddenly clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed her
Enter Input : passionately.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite I
Enter Input : tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of his
Enter Input : mind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the
Enter Input : wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank ‘to my
Enter Input : vile heart.’ Mitya, my falcon, why don’t you kiss me? He kissed me once,
Enter Input : and now he draws back and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me,
Enter Input : kiss me hard, that’s right. If you love, well, then, love! I’ll be your
Enter Input : slave now, your slave for the rest of my life. It’s sweet to be a slave.
Enter Input : Kiss me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I do
Enter Input : deserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won’t have that....” she
Enter Input : suddenly thrust him away. “Go along, Mitya, I’ll come and have some wine,
Enter Input : I want to be drunk, I’m going to get drunk and dance; I must, I must!” She
Enter Input : tore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain. Mitya
Enter Input : followed like a drunken man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, come what may—whatever may happen now, for one minute I’d give the
Enter Input : whole world,” he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole glass
Enter Input : of champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She sat down in
Enter Input : the same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her face. Her cheeks
Enter Input : were glowing, her lips were burning, her flashing eyes were moist; there
Enter Input : was passionate appeal in her eyes. Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart
Enter Input : and went up to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?” she said
Enter Input : thickly. “I’m drunk now, that’s what it is.... And aren’t you drunk? And
Enter Input : why isn’t Mitya drinking? Why don’t you drink, Mitya? I’m drunk, and you
Enter Input : don’t drink....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am drunk! I’m drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I’ll be
Enter Input : drunk with wine, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He drank off another glass, and—he thought it strange himself—that glass
Enter Input : made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although till that
Enter Input : moment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that moment
Enter Input : everything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He walked,
Enter Input : laughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was doing. Only one
Enter Input : persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, “like a red-hot
Enter Input : coal in his heart,” he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her,
Enter Input : gazed at her, listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling
Enter Input : every one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When
Enter Input : the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross
Enter Input : over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amused
Enter Input : by the “little old man,” as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to
Enter Input : kiss her hands, “each little finger,” and finally he danced another dance
Enter Input : to an old song, which he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to the
Enter Input : refrain:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     The little pig says—umph! umph! umph!
Enter Input :     The little calf says—moo, moo, moo,
Enter Input :     The little duck says—quack, quack, quack,
Enter Input :     The little goose says—ga, ga, ga.
Enter Input :     The hen goes strutting through the porch;
Enter Input :     Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say,
Enter Input :     Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give him something, Mitya,” said Grushenka. “Give him a present, he’s
Enter Input : poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I shall
Enter Input : go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something to
Enter Input : me to-day that I shall remember all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let us
Enter Input : dance. To-morrow to the nunnery, but to-day we’ll dance. I want to play
Enter Input : to-day, good people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God,
Enter Input : I’d forgive every one: ‘My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive
Enter Input : you.’ I’m going to beg forgiveness: ‘Forgive me, good people, a silly
Enter Input : wench.’ I’m a beast, that’s what I am. But I want to pray. I gave a little
Enter Input : onion. Wicked as I’ve been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them dance, don’t
Enter Input : stop them. Every one in the world is good. Every one—even the worst of
Enter Input : them. The world’s a nice place. Though we’re bad the world’s all right.
Enter Input : We’re good and bad, good and bad.... Come, tell me, I’ve something to ask
Enter Input : you: come here every one, and I’ll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I
Enter Input : am good. I’m very good.... Come, why am I so good?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last she
Enter Input : announced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her chair,
Enter Input : staggering. “Mitya, don’t give me any more wine—if I ask you, don’t give
Enter Input : it to me. Wine doesn’t give peace. Everything’s going round, the stove,
Enter Input : and everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance ... let
Enter Input : them see how beautifully I dance....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her
Enter Input : pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave it in the
Enter Input : dance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to break
Enter Input : into a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov, hearing that Grushenka
Enter Input : wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front of
Enter Input : her, humming:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     With legs so slim and sides so trim
Enter Input :     And its little tail curled tight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sh-h! Mitya, why don’t they come? Let every one come ... to look on. Call
Enter Input : them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in? Tell them
Enter Input : I’m going to dance. Let them look on, too....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began knocking
Enter Input : to the Poles with his fist.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she’s going to dance. She calls you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Lajdak!_” one of the Poles shouted in reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re a _lajdak_ yourself! You’re a little scoundrel, that’s what you
Enter Input : are.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Leave off laughing at Poland,” said Kalganov sententiously. He too was
Enter Input : drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn’t mean that I called
Enter Input : all Poland so. One _lajdak_ doesn’t make a Poland. Be quiet, my pretty
Enter Input : boy, eat a sweetmeat.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won’t they make
Enter Input : friends?” said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke into
Enter Input : “Ah, my porch, my new porch!” Grushenka flung back her head, half opened
Enter Input : her lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief, and suddenly, with a violent
Enter Input : lurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking bewildered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m weak....” she said in an exhausted voice. “Forgive me.... I’m weak, I
Enter Input : can’t.... I’m sorry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m sorry.... Forgive me....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The lady’s been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,” voices were
Enter Input : heard saying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The lady’s drunk too much,” Maximov explained to the girls, giggling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, lead me away ... take me,” said Grushenka helplessly. Mitya
Enter Input : pounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the precious
Enter Input : burden through the curtains.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, now I’ll go,” thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue room,
Enter Input : he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the orgy in the larger
Enter Input : room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed
Enter Input : and kissed her on the lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t touch me....” she faltered, in an imploring voice. “Don’t touch me,
Enter Input : till I’m yours.... I’ve told you I’m yours, but don’t touch me ... spare
Enter Input : me.... With them here, with them close, you mustn’t. He’s here. It’s nasty
Enter Input : here....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll obey you! I won’t think of it ... I worship you!” muttered Mitya.
Enter Input : “Yes, it’s nasty here, it’s abominable.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know, though you’re a brute, you’re generous,” Grushenka articulated
Enter Input : with difficulty. “It must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for the
Enter Input : future ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but good ...
Enter Input : take me away, take me far away, do you hear? I don’t want it to be here,
Enter Input : but far, far away....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, yes, it must be!” said Mitya, pressing her in his arms. “I’ll
Enter Input : take you and we’ll fly away.... Oh, I’d give my whole life for one year
Enter Input : only to know about that blood!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What blood?” asked Grushenka, bewildered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing,” muttered Mitya, through his teeth. “Grusha, you wanted to be
Enter Input : honest, but I’m a thief. But I’ve stolen money from Katya.... Disgrace, a
Enter Input : disgrace!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn’t steal it. Give it her
Enter Input : back, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is
Enter Input : yours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like us
Enter Input : are bound to waste money. But we’d better go and work the land. I want to
Enter Input : dig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said
Enter Input : so. I won’t be your mistress, I’ll be faithful to you, I’ll be your slave,
Enter Input : I’ll work for you. We’ll go to the young lady and bow down to her
Enter Input : together, so that she may forgive us, and then we’ll go away. And if she
Enter Input : won’t forgive us, we’ll go, anyway. Take her her money and love me....
Enter Input : Don’t love her.... Don’t love her any more. If you love her, I shall
Enter Input : strangle her.... I’ll put out both her eyes with a needle....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I love you. I love only you. I’ll love you in Siberia....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don’t care ... we’ll
Enter Input : work ... there’s snow in Siberia.... I love driving in the snow ... and
Enter Input : must have bells.... Do you hear, there’s a bell ringing? Where is that
Enter Input : bell ringing? There are people coming.... Now it’s stopped.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an instant.
Enter Input : There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance, but the
Enter Input : ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast. He did not
Enter Input : notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice that the songs
Enter Input : had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there was
Enter Input : absolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I’ve been asleep and
Enter Input : dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was with
Enter Input : some one I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was holding you and
Enter Input : kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow glistened....
Enter Input : You know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines. It was as
Enter Input : though I was not on earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How
Enter Input : sweet that is!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Close to you,” murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom, her hands.
Enter Input : And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him that she was looking
Enter Input : straight before her, not at him, not into his face, but over his head,
Enter Input : with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An expression of wonder, almost of
Enter Input : alarm, came suddenly into her face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, who is that looking at us?” she whispered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains and
Enter Input : seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here, come to us, come here,” said a voice, speaking not loudly, but
Enter Input : firmly and peremptorily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still. The
Enter Input : room was filled with people, but not those who had been there before. An
Enter Input : instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered. He recognized
Enter Input : all those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the overcoat and
Enter Input : forage-cap with a cockade—was the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And
Enter Input : that “consumptive-looking” trim dandy, “who always has such polished
Enter Input : boots”—that was the deputy prosecutor. “He has a chronometer worth four
Enter Input : hundred roubles; he showed it to me.” And that small young man in
Enter Input : spectacles.... Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had seen him:
Enter Input : he was the “investigating lawyer,” from the “school of jurisprudence,” who
Enter Input : had only lately come to the town. And this man—the inspector of police,
Enter Input : Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well. And those fellows with the
Enter Input : brass plates on, why are they here? And those other two ... peasants....
Enter Input : And there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen! What’s this for, gentlemen?” began Mitya, but suddenly, as
Enter Input : though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing, he cried aloud, at
Enter Input : the top of his voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I un—der—stand!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up to
Enter Input : Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to the
Enter Input : sofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The old man!” cried Mitya frantically. “The old man and his blood!... I
Enter Input : understand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had been mown
Enter Input : down by a scythe.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your father’s
Enter Input : blood cries out against you!” the old captain of police roared suddenly,
Enter Input : stepping up to Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is impossible!” cried the small young man. “Mihail Makarovitch,
Enter Input : Mihail Makarovitch, this won’t do!... I beg you’ll allow me to speak. I
Enter Input : should never have expected such behavior from you....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,” cried the captain of
Enter Input : police; “look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company of a
Enter Input : disreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his hands.... It’s
Enter Input : delirium!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your
Enter Input : feelings,” the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police
Enter Input : captain, “or I shall be forced to resort to—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to Mitya, and
Enter Input : delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are charged
Enter Input : with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, perpetrated
Enter Input : this night....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, but
Enter Input : though Mitya heard them he did not understand them. He stared at them all
Enter Input : with wild eyes.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book IX. The Preliminary Investigation
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotin’s Official Career
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates
Enter Input : of the widow Morozov’s house, ended, of course, by making himself heard.
Enter Input : Fenya, who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before,
Enter Input : and too much “upset” to go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on
Enter Input : hearing the furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him
Enter Input : drive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking
Enter Input : again, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the house-porter,
Enter Input : who had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring him
Enter Input : not to open it. But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he
Enter Input : wanted to see Fenya on very “important business,” the man made up his mind
Enter Input : at last to open. Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya’s kitchen, but the
Enter Input : girl begged him to allow the house-porter to be present, “because of her
Enter Input : misgivings.” He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital
Enter Input : fact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for
Enter Input : Grushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he
Enter Input : returned, the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with
Enter Input : blood.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!” Fenya
Enter Input : kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of her
Enter Input : disordered imagination. But although not “dripping,” Pyotr Ilyitch had
Enter Input : himself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash them.
Enter Input : Moreover, the question he had to decide was not how soon the blood had
Enter Input : dried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather,
Enter Input : whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, and how he could
Enter Input : satisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this
Enter Input : point, and though he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a
Enter Input : conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his
Enter Input : father’s house, and that therefore something must have happened there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And when he came back,” Fenya added with excitement, “I told him the
Enter Input : whole story, and then I began asking him, ‘Why have you got blood on your
Enter Input : hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?’ and he answered that that was human blood,
Enter Input : and that he had just killed some one. He confessed it all to me, and
Enter Input : suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking, where’s he
Enter Input : run off to now like a madman? He’ll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my
Enter Input : mistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running to his
Enter Input : lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov’s shop, and saw him just setting off,
Enter Input : and there was no blood on his hands then.” (Fenya had noticed this and
Enter Input : remembered it.) Fenya’s old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far as
Enter Input : she was capable. After asking some further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left
Enter Input : the house, even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to go
Enter Input : straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, to find out whether anything had happened
Enter Input : there, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain, as Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had satisfied himself of the fact.
Enter Input : But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s gates were strong, and he
Enter Input : would have to knock again. His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of
Enter Input : the slightest, and what if, after he had been knocking, they opened to
Enter Input : him, and nothing had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way
Enter Input : would go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called
Enter Input : Perhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one had killed
Enter Input : him. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded
Enter Input : more than anything in the world.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he stamped
Enter Input : his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not to Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s but to Madame Hohlakov’s. He decided that if she denied
Enter Input : having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he would go
Enter Input : straight to the police captain, but if she admitted having given him the
Enter Input : money, he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of
Enter Input : causing scandal by going at eleven o’clock at night to a fashionable lady,
Enter Input : a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her an
Enter Input : amazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that is just how
Enter Input : it is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one, with the
Enter Input : decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by
Enter Input : no means phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all his life how a
Enter Input : haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him, growing more and
Enter Input : more painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursing
Enter Input : himself, of course, all the way for going to this lady, but “I will get to
Enter Input : the bottom of it, I will!” he repeated for the tenth time, grinding his
Enter Input : teeth, and he carried out his intention.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was exactly eleven o’clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov’s house. He
Enter Input : was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his inquiry
Enter Input : whether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer, except
Enter Input : that she was usually in bed by that time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, she’ll
Enter Input : receive you. If she won’t, she won’t.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The footman
Enter Input : was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid. Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that an
Enter Input : official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on particular
Enter Input : business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would not
Enter Input : have ventured to come. “Tell her in those words, in those words exactly,”
Enter Input : he asked the girl.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov herself
Enter Input : was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt upset ever
Enter Input : since Mitya’s visit, and had a presentiment that she would not get through
Enter Input : the night without the sick headache which always, with her, followed such
Enter Input : excitement. She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.
Enter Input : She irritably declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at
Enter Input : such an hour, of an “official living in the town,” who was a total
Enter Input : stranger, roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to
Enter Input : take another message in these very words:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to see him
Enter Input : now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I plunged headlong,” he described it afterwards.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again.
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he looked
Enter Input : like, and learned that he was “very well dressed, young and so polite.” We
Enter Input : may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking
Enter Input : young man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to
Enter Input : see him. She was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black
Enter Input : shawl over her shoulders. “The official” was asked to walk into the
Enter Input : drawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly
Enter Input : before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiring
Enter Input : countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once with the
Enter Input : question:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our common
Enter Input : acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,” Perhotin began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady’s face showed signs of
Enter Input : acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a fury:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?” she cried
Enter Input : hysterically. “How dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a lady
Enter Input : who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And to
Enter Input : force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this very
Enter Input : drawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out of
Enter Input : the room, as no one would go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir,
Enter Input : that I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass.
Enter Input : Kindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, has he killed somebody else?” Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I’ll explain it all
Enter Input : in a couple of words,” answered Perhotin, firmly. “At five o’clock this
Enter Input : afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I know for
Enter Input : a fact he had no money. Yet at nine o’clock, he came to see me with a
Enter Input : bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, about two or three thousand
Enter Input : roubles. His hands and face were all covered with blood, and he looked
Enter Input : like a madman. When I asked him where he had got so much money, he
Enter Input : answered that he had just received it from you, that you had given him a
Enter Input : sum of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov’s face assumed an expression of intense and painful
Enter Input : excitement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good God! He must have killed his old father!” she cried, clasping her
Enter Input : hands. “I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don’t say
Enter Input : another word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for a
Enter Input : fact that you did not give him any money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t, I didn’t! I refused to give it him, for he could not
Enter Input : appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but I
Enter Input : slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from you
Enter Input : now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are we
Enter Input : standing? Ah, sit down.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, I....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an awful
Enter Input : death!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But if he has killed him already?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think we
Enter Input : must do now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself, facing
Enter Input : him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her the history of
Enter Input : the affair, that part of it at least which he had himself witnessed. He
Enter Input : described, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her about the pestle. All
Enter Input : these details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who
Enter Input : kept uttering shrieks, and covering her face with her hands....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty,
Enter Input : whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I’ve looked at that awful
Enter Input : man and always thought, that man will end by murdering me. And now it’s
Enter Input : happened ... that is, if he hasn’t murdered me, but only his own father,
Enter Input : it’s only because the finger of God preserved me, and what’s more, he was
Enter Input : ashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from
Enter Input : the relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to think
Enter Input : how near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him and he
Enter Input : stretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you
Enter Input : said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don’t believe in miracles, but that
Enter Input : ikon and this unmistakable miracle with me now—that shakes me, and I’m
Enter Input : ready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about Father
Enter Input : Zossima?... But I don’t know what I’m saying ... and only fancy, with the
Enter Input : ikon on his neck he spat at me.... He only spat, it’s true, he didn’t
Enter Input : murder me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we do
Enter Input : now? What do you think?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight to the
Enter Input : police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do what he
Enter Input : thought fit.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, he’s an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I know him. Of
Enter Input : course, he’s the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr Ilyitch!
Enter Input : How well you’ve thought of everything! I should never have thought of it
Enter Input : in your place!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,” observed Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious to escape
Enter Input : as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not let him say
Enter Input : good-by and go away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And be sure, be sure,” she prattled on, “to come back and tell me what
Enter Input : you see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... how
Enter Input : they’ll try him ... and what he’s condemned to.... Tell me, we have no
Enter Input : capital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it’s at three
Enter Input : o’clock at night, at four, at half-past four.... Tell them to wake me, to
Enter Input : wake me, to shake me, if I don’t get up.... But, good heavens, I shan’t
Enter Input : sleep! But wait, hadn’t I better come with you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “N—no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating that
Enter Input : you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be of use
Enter Input : ... in case it’s needed....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure!” Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau. “And you
Enter Input : know I’m simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense in
Enter Input : such affairs. Are you in the service here? I’m delighted to think that
Enter Input : you’re in the service here!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the
Enter Input : following lines:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     I’ve never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri
Enter Input :     Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy),
Enter Input :     three thousand roubles to-day. I’ve never given him money, never:
Enter Input :     That I swear by all that’s holy!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     K. HOHLAKOV.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here’s the note!” she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. “Go, save him.
Enter Input : It’s a noble deed on your part!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran out to
Enter Input : accompany him to the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How grateful I am to you! You can’t think how grateful I am to you for
Enter Input : having come to me, first. How is it I haven’t met you before? I shall feel
Enter Input : flattered at seeing you at my house in the future. How delightful it is
Enter Input : that you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical ability!...
Enter Input : They must appreciate you, they must understand you. If there’s anything I
Enter Input : can do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! I’m in love with young
Enter Input : people! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country.
Enter Input : Her one hope.... Oh, go, go!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let him go so
Enter Input : soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him,
Enter Input : which had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such an
Enter Input : unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all know. “She’s by no means so
Enter Input : elderly,” he thought, feeling pleased, “on the contrary I should have
Enter Input : taken her for her daughter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young man. “Such
Enter Input : sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all that with
Enter Input : such manners and appearance! People say the young people of to-day are no
Enter Input : good for anything, but here’s an example!” etc. So she simply forgot this
Enter Input : “dreadful affair,” and it was only as she was getting into bed, that,
Enter Input : suddenly recalling “how near death she had been,” she exclaimed: “Ah, it
Enter Input : is awful, awful!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details,
Enter Input : if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no means
Enter Input : elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of the
Enter Input : whole career of that practical and precise young man. His story is
Enter Input : remembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I shall perhaps
Enter Input : have something to say about it, when I have finished my long history of
Enter Input : the Brothers Karamazov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. The Alarm
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired
Enter Input : lieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only come
Enter Input : to us three years previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly because
Enter Input : he “knew how to keep society together.” He was never without visitors, and
Enter Input : could not have got on without them. Some one or other was always dining
Enter Input : with him; he never sat down to table without guests. He gave regular
Enter Input : dinners, too, on all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones.
Enter Input : Though the fare was not _recherché_, it was abundant. The fish-pies were
Enter Input : excellent, and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room, with
Enter Input : pictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls, an
Enter Input : essential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor’s billiard-room.
Enter Input : There was card-playing every evening at his house, if only at one table.
Enter Input : But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the mammas
Enter Input : and young ladies, assembled at his house to dance. Though Mihail
Enter Input : Makarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone. His widowed daughter
Enter Input : lived with him, with her two unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who had
Enter Input : finished their education. They were of agreeable appearance and lively
Enter Input : character, and though every one knew they would have no dowry, they
Enter Input : attracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfather’s house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work, though he
Enter Input : performed his duties no worse than many others. To speak plainly, he was a
Enter Input : man of rather narrow education. His understanding of the limits of his
Enter Input : administrative power could not always be relied upon. It was not so much
Enter Input : that he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign,
Enter Input : as that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them. This
Enter Input : was not from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for
Enter Input : he was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,” he used to say
Enter Input : of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamental
Enter Input : principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs,
Enter Input : and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year, involuntarily
Enter Input : increasing his knowledge by practice. And yet he was himself a landowner.
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he would meet some of Mihail
Enter Input : Makarovitch’s visitors there that evening, but he didn’t know which. As it
Enter Input : happened, at that moment the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district
Enter Input : doctor, a young man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after
Enter Input : taking a brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist
Enter Input : at the police captain’s. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was
Enter Input : really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),
Enter Input : was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined to be
Enter Input : consumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He was vain and
Enter Input : irritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a kind heart. It
Enter Input : seemed that all that was wrong with him was that he had a better opinion
Enter Input : of himself than his ability warranted. And that made him seem constantly
Enter Input : uneasy. He had, moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards
Enter Input : psychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a special
Enter Input : knowledge of the criminal and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this
Enter Input : ground, considering that he had been passed over in the service, and being
Enter Input : firmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properly
Enter Input : appreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to give
Enter Input : up his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected
Enter Input : Karamazov case agitated him profoundly: “It was a case that might well be
Enter Input : talked about all over Russia.” But I am anticipating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who had
Enter Input : only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next room
Enter Input : with the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards and wondered that
Enter Input : all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the evening of “the
Enter Input : crime” have been gathered together at the house of the executive
Enter Input : authority. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch’s wife had had toothache for the last two days, and
Enter Input : he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor, from the
Enter Input : very nature of his being, could not spend an evening except at cards.
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days past to
Enter Input : drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch’s, so to speak casually, so as
Enter Input : slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showing
Enter Input : that he knew her secret, that he knew it was her birthday, and that she
Enter Input : was trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give a
Enter Input : dance. He anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests about
Enter Input : her age, and her being afraid to reveal it, about his knowing her secret
Enter Input : and telling everybody, and so on. The charming young man was a great adept
Enter Input : at such teasing; the ladies had christened him “the naughty man,” and he
Enter Input : seemed to be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however,
Enter Input : of good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of
Enter Input : pleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He was
Enter Input : short, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he
Enter Input : always wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his
Enter Input : official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though
Enter Input : realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him.
Enter Input : He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the
Enter Input : peasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their respect,
Enter Input : he certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police
Enter Input : captain’s. He saw instantly that every one knew. They had positively
Enter Input : thrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous and
Enter Input : ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news that old
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his own house,
Enter Input : murdered and robbed. The news had only just reached them in the following
Enter Input : manner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senseless
Enter Input : near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might well have slept
Enter Input : till morning after the draught she had taken. But, all of a sudden she
Enter Input : waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : who was lying in the next room unconscious. That scream always preceded
Enter Input : his fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never
Enter Input : get accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov’s
Enter Input : room. But it was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginning
Enter Input : to gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out and was
Enter Input : going to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when she had got up,
Enter Input : he was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the bedstead and began
Enter Input : groping with her hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he must have
Enter Input : gone out—where? She ran to the steps and timidly called him. She got no
Enter Input : answer, of course, but she caught the sound of groans far away in the
Enter Input : garden in the darkness. She listened. The groans were repeated, and it was
Enter Input : evident they came from the garden.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!” she thought
Enter Input : distractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate into
Enter Input : the garden was open.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He must be out there, poor dear,” she thought. She went up to the gate
Enter Input : and all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her by name, “Marfa!
Enter Input : Marfa!” in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lord, preserve us from harm!” Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran towards
Enter Input : the voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she found him not by
Enter Input : the fence where he had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. It
Enter Input : appeared later, that he had crawled away on coming to himself, and
Enter Input : probably had been a long time getting so far, losing consciousness several
Enter Input : times. She noticed at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at
Enter Input : the top of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream, silly ... run ...
Enter Input : fetch some one....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master’s window was
Enter Input : open and that there was a candle alight in the window, she ran there and
Enter Input : began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in at the window, she saw a
Enter Input : fearful sight. Her master was lying on his back, motionless, on the floor.
Enter Input : His light-colored dressing-gown and white shirt were soaked with blood.
Enter Input : The candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless
Enter Input : dead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from
Enter Input : the window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran
Enter Input : headlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both mother
Enter Input : and daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa’s desperate and
Enter Input : persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter. Marfa, shrieking and
Enter Input : screaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg for
Enter Input : assistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his wanderings and
Enter Input : was staying the night with them. They got him up immediately and all three
Enter Input : ran to the scene of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered
Enter Input : that at about eight o’clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,
Enter Input : and this was no doubt Grigory’s scream, “Parricide!” uttered when he
Enter Input : caught hold of Mitya’s leg.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Some one person screamed out and then was silent,” Marya Kondratyevna
Enter Input : explained as she ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the two
Enter Input : women with the help of Foma carried him to the lodge. They lighted a
Enter Input : candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he was writhing in
Enter Input : convulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing from
Enter Input : his lips. They moistened Grigory’s forehead with water mixed with vinegar,
Enter Input : and the water revived him at once. He asked immediately:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is the master murdered?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that not
Enter Input : only the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open, though
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every night and
Enter Input : did not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext. Seeing that door
Enter Input : open, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch “for fear anything
Enter Input : should happen afterwards.” And when they returned to Grigory, the old man
Enter Input : told them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran
Enter Input : there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain’s. She
Enter Input : arrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story came,
Enter Input : not as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation, by a
Enter Input : witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the criminal (a
Enter Input : theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe till that
Enter Input : moment).
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector of the
Enter Input : town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitch’s
Enter Input : house and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regular
Enter Input : forms, which I will not go into here. The district doctor, a zealous man,
Enter Input : new to his work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, the
Enter Input : prosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead,
Enter Input : with his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with the same
Enter Input : weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that weapon
Enter Input : was found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at once
Enter Input : given, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knocked
Enter Input : down. They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass
Enter Input : pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were
Enter Input : no signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. But
Enter Input : by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and
Enter Input : thick envelope with the inscription: “A present of three thousand roubles
Enter Input : for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.” And below had been
Enter Input : added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, “For my little chicken.” There were three
Enter Input : seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open and
Enter Input : was empty: the money had been removed. They found also on the floor a
Enter Input : piece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch’s evidence made a great impression on the
Enter Input : prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved to
Enter Input : do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded them
Enter Input : before him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc. When Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell some
Enter Input : one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: “You’ll be
Enter Input : too late.” So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before
Enter Input : he really did shoot himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s clear, that’s clear!” repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.
Enter Input : “That’s just the way with mad fellows like that: ‘I shall kill myself
Enter Input : to-morrow, so I’ll make merry till I die!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the
Enter Input : prosecutor more than ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev,
Enter Input : gentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair curled,
Enter Input : and then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his hand in
Enter Input : the same way, he went off to the girls.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the
Enter Input : formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took time and
Enter Input : so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer of
Enter Input : the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in the
Enter Input : town the morning before to get his pay. He was instructed to avoid raising
Enter Input : the alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the
Enter Input : “criminal” till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also
Enter Input : witnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky
Enter Input : Mavrikyevitch did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no
Enter Input : one but his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of
Enter Input : his secret business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the
Enter Input : landlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once
Enter Input : a change in Trifon Borissovitch’s face and voice. So neither Mitya nor any
Enter Input : one else knew that he was being watched. The box with the pistols had been
Enter Input : carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. Only after
Enter Input : four o’clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain,
Enter Input : the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each
Enter Input : drawn by three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s to make
Enter Input : a post-mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly interested in
Enter Input : the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for
Enter Input : twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to
Enter Input : science,” he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they left
Enter Input : they laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor and the
Enter Input : investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor’s saying that
Enter Input : Smerdyakov could not outlive the night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to
Enter Input : that moment of our tale at which we broke off.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First Ordeal
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not understanding
Enter Input : what was said to him. Suddenly he got up, flung up his hands, and shouted
Enter Input : aloud:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m not guilty! I’m not guilty of that blood! I’m not guilty of my
Enter Input : father’s blood.... I meant to kill him. But I’m not guilty. Not I.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind the
Enter Input : curtain and flung herself at the police captain’s feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!” she cried, in a heartrending
Enter Input : voice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands towards them. “He
Enter Input : did it through me. I tortured him and drove him to it. I tortured that
Enter Input : poor old man that’s dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him to this!
Enter Input : It’s my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it’s your fault! You’re the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!
Enter Input : You’re the most to blame!” shouted the police captain, threatening her
Enter Input : with his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed. The
Enter Input : prosecutor positively seized hold of him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!” he cried. “You are
Enter Input : positively hindering the inquiry.... You’re ruining the case....” he
Enter Input : almost gasped.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course!” cried Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch, fearfully excited too, “otherwise it’s absolutely
Enter Input : impossible!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Judge us together!” Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling. “Punish
Enter Input : us together. I will go with him now, if it’s to death!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!” Mitya fell on his knees beside
Enter Input : her and held her tight in his arms. “Don’t believe her,” he cried, “she’s
Enter Input : not guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her by
Enter Input : several men, and that she was led out, and that when he recovered himself
Enter Input : he was sitting at the table. Beside him and behind him stood the men with
Enter Input : metal plates. Facing him on the other side of the table sat Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink a
Enter Input : little water out of a glass that stood on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don’t be frightened,”
Enter Input : he added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it afterwards) became
Enter Input : suddenly intensely interested in his big rings, one with an amethyst, and
Enter Input : another with a transparent bright yellow stone, of great brilliance. And
Enter Input : long afterwards he remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted his
Enter Input : attention through all those terrible hours of interrogation, so that he
Enter Input : was utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as
Enter Input : things that had nothing to do with his position. On Mitya’s left side, in
Enter Input : the place where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening,
Enter Input : the prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya’s right hand, where Grushenka
Enter Input : had been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting-jacket,
Enter Input : with ink and paper before him. This was the secretary of the investigating
Enter Input : lawyer, who had brought him with him. The police captain was now standing
Enter Input : by the window at the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was
Enter Input : sitting there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Drink some water,” said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenth
Enter Input : time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush me,
Enter Input : punish me, decide my fate!” cried Mitya, staring with terribly fixed
Enter Input : wide-open eyes at the investigating lawyer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your
Enter Input : father, Fyodor Pavlovitch?” asked the investigating lawyer, softly but
Enter Input : insistently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not of
Enter Input : my father’s. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the old man and knocked
Enter Input : him down.... But it’s hard to have to answer for that murder with another,
Enter Input : a terrible murder of which I am not guilty.... It’s a terrible accusation,
Enter Input : gentlemen, a knock-down blow. But who has killed my father, who has killed
Enter Input : him? Who can have killed him if I didn’t? It’s marvelous, extraordinary,
Enter Input : impossible.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, who can have killed him?” the investigating lawyer was beginning,
Enter Input : but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him, addressed
Enter Input : Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory Vassilyevitch.
Enter Input : He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible blows
Enter Input : inflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by you, there seems no
Enter Input : doubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at least.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alive? He’s alive?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His face beamed.
Enter Input : “Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a sinner and
Enter Input : evildoer. That’s an answer to my prayer. I’ve been praying all night.” And
Enter Input : he crossed himself three times. He was almost breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence concerning
Enter Input : you, that—” The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya suddenly jumped
Enter Input : up from his chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One minute, gentlemen, for God’s sake, one minute; I will run to her—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, at this moment it’s quite impossible,” Nikolay Parfenovitch
Enter Input : almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was seized by the men
Enter Input : with the metal plates, but he sat down of his own accord....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute only; I wanted
Enter Input : to tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone, that blood that was
Enter Input : weighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a murderer now!
Enter Input : Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!” he said ecstatically and reverently,
Enter Input : looking round at them all. “Oh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute
Enter Input : you have given me new life, new heart!... That old man used to carry me in
Enter Input : his arms, gentlemen. He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three
Enter Input : years old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And so you—” the investigating lawyer began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,” interposed Mitya, putting
Enter Input : his elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands. “Let me have
Enter Input : a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is horribly
Enter Input : upsetting, horribly. A man is not a drum, gentlemen!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Drink a little more water,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were confident.
Enter Input : He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole bearing was
Enter Input : changed; he was once more the equal of these men, with all of whom he was
Enter Input : acquainted, as though they had all met the day before, when nothing had
Enter Input : happened, at some social gathering. We may note in passing that, on his
Enter Input : first arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captain’s,
Enter Input : but later, during the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at
Enter Input : all, and when the police captain met him, in the street, for instance,
Enter Input : Mitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His
Enter Input : acquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes
Enter Input : paid his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without
Enter Input : quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had, for
Enter Input : some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not had time
Enter Input : to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had met him and talked
Enter Input : to him twice, each time about the fair sex.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,” cried Mitya,
Enter Input : laughing gayly, “but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen, I feel like a new
Enter Input : man, and don’t be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly.
Enter Input : I’m rather drunk, too, I’ll tell you that frankly. I believe I’ve had the
Enter Input : honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman
Enter Input : Miüsov’s. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don’t pretend to be on equal terms with
Enter Input : you. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before you.
Enter Input : Oh, of course, there’s a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if
Enter Input : Grigory has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! It’s awful, awful, I
Enter Input : understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will make
Enter Input : an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen! Since I know
Enter Input : I’m innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute. Can’t we? Can’t we?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though he
Enter Input : positively took his listeners to be his best friends.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the charge
Enter Input : brought against you,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively, and bending
Enter Input : down to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what to write.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I consent, I
Enter Input : give my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay, stay, write
Enter Input : this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of violence on a poor old man I
Enter Input : am guilty. And there is something else at the bottom of my heart, of which
Enter Input : I am guilty, too—but that you need not write down” (he turned suddenly to
Enter Input : the secretary); “that’s my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn’t concern
Enter Input : you, the bottom of my heart, that’s to say.... But of the murder of my old
Enter Input : father I’m not guilty. That’s a wild idea. It’s quite a wild idea!... I
Enter Input : will prove you that and you’ll be convinced directly.... You will laugh,
Enter Input : gentlemen. You’ll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said the investigating lawyer evidently
Enter Input : trying to allay Mitya’s excitement by his own composure. “Before we go on
Enter Input : with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to hear
Enter Input : you confirm the statement that you disliked your father, Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him. Here at
Enter Input : least, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill
Enter Input : him: ‘I didn’t kill him,’ you said, ‘but I wanted to kill him.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I did
Enter Input : want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily, unhappily!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives precisely led
Enter Input : you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is there to explain, gentlemen?” Mitya shrugged his shoulders
Enter Input : sullenly, looking down. “I have never concealed my feelings. All the town
Enter Input : knows about it—every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I declared them
Enter Input : in Father Zossima’s cell.... And the very same day, in the evening I beat
Enter Input : my father. I nearly killed him, and I swore I’d come again and kill him,
Enter Input : before witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! I’ve been shouting it aloud
Enter Input : for the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares you in
Enter Input : the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,
Enter Input : feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen”—Mitya frowned—“it seems
Enter Input : to me that about feelings you’ve no right to question me. I know that you
Enter Input : are bound by your office, I quite understand that, but that’s my affair,
Enter Input : my private, intimate affair, yet ... since I haven’t concealed my feelings
Enter Input : in the past ... in the tavern, for instance, I’ve talked to every one, so
Enter Input : ... so I won’t make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,
Enter Input : that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every
Enter Input : one that I’d kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he’s been killed. So it
Enter Input : must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can
Enter Input : quite make allowances. I’m struck all of a heap myself, for who can have
Enter Input : murdered him, if not I? That’s what it comes to, isn’t it? If not I, who
Enter Input : can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on knowing!” he
Enter Input : exclaimed suddenly. “Where was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and
Enter Input : with what? Tell me,” he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his head
Enter Input : battered in,” said the prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s horrible!” Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the table,
Enter Input : hid his face in his right hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We will continue,” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. “So what was it that
Enter Input : impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in public, I
Enter Input : believe, that it was based upon jealousy?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Disputes about money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, about money, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which you
Enter Input : claimed as part of your inheritance?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Three thousand! More, more,” cried Mitya hotly; “more than six thousand,
Enter Input : more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at them. But I
Enter Input : made up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was desperately in need
Enter Input : of that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes for three thousand that
Enter Input : I knew he kept under his pillow, ready for Grushenka, I considered as
Enter Input : simply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own
Enter Input : property....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and had
Enter Input : time to wink at him on the sly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We will return to that subject later,” said the lawyer promptly. “You
Enter Input : will allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked upon
Enter Input : that money as your own property?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Write it down, by all means. I know that’s another fact that tells
Enter Input : against me, but I’m not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself. Do
Enter Input : you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort of man
Enter Input : from what I am,” he added, suddenly gloomy and dejected. “You have to deal
Enter Input : with a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above all—don’t lose
Enter Input : sight of it—a man who’s done a lot of nasty things, but has always been,
Enter Input : and still is, honorable at bottom, in his inner being. I don’t know how to
Enter Input : express it. That’s just what’s made me wretched all my life, that I
Enter Input : yearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of
Enter Input : honor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and
Enter Input : yet all my life I’ve been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemen
Enter Input : ... that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!...
Enter Input : Gentlemen, my head aches ...” His brows contracted with pain. “You see,
Enter Input : gentlemen, I couldn’t bear the look of him, there was something in him
Enter Input : ignoble, impudent, trampling on everything sacred, something sneering and
Enter Input : irreverent, loathsome, loathsome. But now that he’s dead, I feel
Enter Input : differently.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t feel differently, but I wish I hadn’t hated him so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You feel penitent?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not penitent, don’t write that. I’m not much good myself, I’m not
Enter Input : very beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive. That’s what I
Enter Input : mean. Write that down, if you like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more gloomy
Enter Input : as the inquiry continued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka had
Enter Input : been removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next but
Enter Input : one from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It was a
Enter Input : little room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they had
Enter Input : danced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her
Enter Input : but Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her
Enter Input : side, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants with
Enter Input : a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her grief
Enter Input : was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her arms and, with a loud
Enter Input : wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him, to her Mitya, and so
Enter Input : unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry,
Enter Input : trembled, jumped up, and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, not
Enter Input : knowing what he was doing. But they were not allowed to come together,
Enter Input : though they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled, and
Enter Input : tried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold him. She was
Enter Input : seized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms to him, crying aloud as
Enter Input : they carried her away. When the scene was over, he came to himself again,
Enter Input : sitting in the same place as before, opposite the investigating lawyer,
Enter Input : and crying out to them:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She’s done nothing,
Enter Input : nothing!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like this. At
Enter Input : last Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into the
Enter Input : room, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s been removed, she’s downstairs. Will you allow me to say one word
Enter Input : to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in your
Enter Input : presence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,” answered the investigating lawyer. “In
Enter Input : the present case we have nothing against it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,” began the police captain,
Enter Input : and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the luckless
Enter Input : prisoner on his excited face. “I took your Agrafena Alexandrovna
Enter Input : downstairs myself, and confided her to the care of the landlord’s
Enter Input : daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her all the time. And I
Enter Input : soothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed her. I impressed on her
Enter Input : that you have to clear yourself, so she mustn’t hinder you, must not
Enter Input : depress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your
Enter Input : evidence. In fact, I talked to her and she understood. She’s a sensible
Enter Input : girl, my boy, a good-hearted girl, she would have kissed my old hands,
Enter Input : begging help for you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about
Enter Input : her. And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you are
Enter Input : calm and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?
Enter Input : I was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you,
Enter Input : she’s a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So what am I to tell
Enter Input : her, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular, but
Enter Input : Grushenka’s suffering, a fellow creature’s suffering, touched his
Enter Input : good-natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped up and
Enter Input : rushed towards him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!” he cried. “You’ve the
Enter Input : heart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her. I
Enter Input : will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in the kindness of your
Enter Input : heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be laughing in a
Enter Input : minute, knowing that she has a guardian angel like you. I shall have done
Enter Input : with all this directly, and as soon as I’m free, I’ll be with her, she’ll
Enter Input : see, let her wait. Gentlemen,” he said, turning to the two lawyers, “now
Enter Input : I’ll open my whole soul to you; I’ll pour out everything. We’ll finish
Enter Input : this off directly, finish it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end,
Enter Input : shan’t we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me
Enter Input : tell you that. That one thing I’ll tell you now.... I see I’m with
Enter Input : honorable men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you knew!
Enter Input : Did you hear her cry, ‘I’ll go to death with you’? And what have I, a
Enter Input : penniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for me? How can a clumsy,
Enter Input : ugly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she is
Enter Input : ready to go to exile with me? And how she fell down at your feet for my
Enter Input : sake, just now!... and yet she’s proud and has done nothing! How can I
Enter Input : help adoring her, how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did
Enter Input : just now? Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands, burst
Enter Input : into tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered himself instantly. The
Enter Input : old police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers also. They felt
Enter Input : that the examination was passing into a new phase. When the police captain
Enter Input : went out, Mitya was positively gay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal. And if
Enter Input : it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand one
Enter Input : another in a minute. I’m at those details again. I’m at your disposal,
Enter Input : gentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in me
Enter Input : and I in you, or there’ll be no end to it. I speak in your interests. To
Enter Input : business, gentlemen, to business, and don’t rummage in my soul; don’t
Enter Input : tease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what matters, and I
Enter Input : will satisfy you at once. And damn the details!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. The Second Ordeal
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by your
Enter Input : readiness to answer,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air, and
Enter Input : obvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent, short-sighted, light
Enter Input : gray eyes, from which he had removed his spectacles a moment before. “And
Enter Input : you have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence, without
Enter Input : which it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such
Enter Input : importance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend
Enter Input : himself and is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everything
Enter Input : in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case.
Enter Input : You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?” He turned to the prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, undoubtedly,” replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat cold,
Enter Input : compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch’s impulsiveness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but lately
Enter Input : arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his bosom friend. He
Enter Input : was almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch’s extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in
Enter Input : the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him in Petersburg. On the
Enter Input : other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the whole
Enter Input : world whom our “unappreciated” prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to
Enter Input : Mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case.
Enter Input : And now as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and
Enter Input : interpreted every indication on his senior colleague’s face—half a word, a
Enter Input : glance, or a wink.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don’t interrupt me with
Enter Input : trivial questions and I’ll tell you everything in a moment,” said Mitya
Enter Input : excitedly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your
Enter Input : communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of
Enter Input : great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at
Enter Input : about five o’clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend,
Enter Input : Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more?
Enter Input : That’s all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn’t you know?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic
Enter Input : description of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards? Allow us,
Enter Input : for instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and just when
Enter Input : you left and when you came back—all those facts.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You should have asked me like that from the beginning,” cried Mitya,
Enter Input : laughing aloud, “and, if you like, we won’t begin from yesterday, but from
Enter Input : the morning of the day before; then you’ll understand how, why, and where
Enter Input : I went. I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the
Enter Input : town, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe
Enter Input : security. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to interrupt you,” the prosecutor put in politely. “Why were you
Enter Input : in such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, gentlemen, you needn’t go into details, how, when and why, and why
Enter Input : just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole. Why, it’ll
Enter Input : run to three volumes, and then you’ll want an epilogue!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of a
Enter Input : man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best
Enter Input : intentions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen!”—he corrected himself hurriedly—“don’t be vexed with me for my
Enter Input : restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more, I feel the greatest
Enter Input : respect for you and understand the true position of affairs. Don’t think
Enter Input : I’m drunk. I’m quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk would be no
Enter Input : hindrance. It’s with me, you know, like the saying: ‘When he is sober, he
Enter Input : is a fool; when he is drunk, he is a wise man.’ Ha ha! But I see,
Enter Input : gentlemen, it’s not the proper thing to make jokes to you, till we’ve had
Enter Input : our explanation, I mean. And I’ve my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite
Enter Input : understand the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position
Enter Input : of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And it’s
Enter Input : your business to watch me. I can’t expect you to pat me on the head for
Enter Input : what I did to Grigory, for one can’t break old men’s heads with impunity.
Enter Input : I suppose you’ll put me away for him for six months, or a year perhaps, in
Enter Input : a house of correction. I don’t know what the punishment is—but it will be
Enter Input : without loss of the rights of my rank, without loss of my rank, won’t it?
Enter Input : So you see, gentlemen, I understand the distinction between us.... But you
Enter Input : must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions. ‘How did
Enter Input : you step? Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did you
Enter Input : step?’ I shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it
Enter Input : all down against me. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even if
Enter Input : it’s nonsense I’m talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being
Enter Input : men of honor and refinement, will forgive me! I’ll finish by asking you,
Enter Input : gentlemen, to drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean,
Enter Input : beginning from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for
Enter Input : breakfast, how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention
Enter Input : of the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, ‘Whom
Enter Input : did you murder? Whom did you rob?’ Ha ha! That’s your regulation method,
Enter Input : that’s where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off their
Enter Input : guard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. I’ve been in the service,
Enter Input : too. Ha ha ha! You’re not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?”
Enter Input : he cried, looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising.
Enter Input : “It’s only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would be
Enter Input : inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the prosecutor did
Enter Input : not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though anxious not
Enter Input : to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the smallest twitch of
Enter Input : any feature of his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s how we have treated you from the beginning,” said Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch, still laughing. “We haven’t tried to put you out by asking
Enter Input : how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast. We began,
Enter Input : indeed, with questions of the greatest importance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still more
Enter Input : your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of your
Enter Input : noble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on the
Enter Input : footing of mutual confidence between educated, well-bred people, who have
Enter Input : the common bond of noble birth and honor. In any case, allow me to look
Enter Input : upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when
Enter Input : my honor is assailed. That’s no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On the contrary. You’ve expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,”
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those tricky
Enter Input : questions!” cried Mitya enthusiastically. “Or there’s simply no knowing
Enter Input : where we shall get to! Is there?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will follow your sensible advice entirely,” the prosecutor interposed,
Enter Input : addressing Mitya. “I don’t withdraw my question, however. It is now
Enter Input : vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I mean
Enter Input : precisely three thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to pay
Enter Input : a debt.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A debt to whom?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldn’t, or
Enter Input : because I shouldn’t dare, or because it would be damaging, for it’s all a
Enter Input : paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but—I won’t, because it’s a matter
Enter Input : of principle: that’s my private life, and I won’t allow any intrusion into
Enter Input : my private life. That’s my principle. Your question has no bearing on the
Enter Input : case, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. I
Enter Input : wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won’t
Enter Input : say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to make a note of that,” said the prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By all means. Write down that I won’t say, that I won’t. Write that I
Enter Input : should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you’ve nothing
Enter Input : else to do with your time.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are
Enter Input : unaware of it,” the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern
Enter Input : impressiveness, “that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions
Enter Input : put to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from
Enter Input : you, if you decline to give it for one reason or another. That is entirely
Enter Input : a matter for your personal decision. But it is our duty, on the other
Enter Input : hand, in such cases as the present, to explain and set before you the
Enter Input : degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or
Enter Input : that piece of evidence. After which I will beg you to continue.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, I’m not angry ... I ...” Mitya muttered in a rather
Enter Input : disconcerted tone. “Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I went
Enter Input : then ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : We will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known to the
Enter Input : reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest
Enter Input : detail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over. But as he gave
Enter Input : his evidence it was written down, and therefore they had continually to
Enter Input : pull him up. Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though still
Enter Input : good-humoredly. He did, it is true, exclaim, from time to time,
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, that’s enough to make an angel out of patience!” Or,
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, it’s no good your irritating me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially
Enter Input : expansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two
Enter Input : days before. (He had completely realized by now that he had been fooled.)
Enter Input : The sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was
Enter Input : something new to the lawyers. They were at once greatly interested, and
Enter Input : even, to Mitya’s intense indignation, thought it necessary to write the
Enter Input : fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had
Enter Input : hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began
Enter Input : to grow surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the
Enter Input : night spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to the
Enter Input : town. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a minute
Enter Input : account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka’s account.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly into the
Enter Input : circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna’s house
Enter Input : at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden to keep watch on Grushenka, and
Enter Input : of Smerdyakov’s bringing him information. They laid particular stress on
Enter Input : this, and noted it down. Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length,
Enter Input : and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to
Enter Input : “public ignominy,” so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order
Enter Input : to tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigating
Enter Input : lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he told
Enter Input : his story, disconcerted him at last considerably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense about
Enter Input : women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my
Enter Input : telling this to,” he reflected mournfully. “It’s ignominious. ‘Be patient,
Enter Input : humble, hold thy peace.’ ” He wound up his reflections with that line. But
Enter Input : he pulled himself together to go on again. When he came to telling of his
Enter Input : visit to Madame Hohlakov, he regained his spirits and even wished to tell
Enter Input : a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case. But
Enter Input : the investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he should
Enter Input : pass on to “more essential matters.” At last, when he described his
Enter Input : despair and told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakov’s, he thought that
Enter Input : he’d “get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,” they
Enter Input : stopped him again and noted down that he had “meant to murder some one.”
Enter Input : Mitya let them write it without protest. At last he reached the point in
Enter Input : his story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned
Enter Input : from Samsonov’s as soon as he left her there, though she had said that she
Enter Input : would stay there till midnight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I didn’t kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadn’t
Enter Input : time,” broke from him suddenly at that point in his story. That, too, was
Enter Input : carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to tell
Enter Input : how he ran into his father’s garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly
Enter Input : stopped him, and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him
Enter Input : he brought out the brass pestle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you recognize this object?” he asked, showing it to Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes,” he laughed gloomily. “Of course I recognize it. Let me have a
Enter Input : look at it.... Damn it, never mind!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have forgotten to mention it,” observed the investigating lawyer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hang it all, I shouldn’t have concealed it from you. Do you suppose I
Enter Input : could have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What for, if you had no object?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya’s wrath flared up. He looked intently at “the boy” and smiled
Enter Input : gloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more ashamed at having
Enter Input : told “such people” the story of his jealousy so sincerely and
Enter Input : spontaneously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bother the pestle!” broke from him suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But still—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything
Enter Input : turned up.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you
Enter Input : went out, since you’re afraid of the dark?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen! There’s positively no talking to you!” cried
Enter Input : Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimson
Enter Input : with anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in his voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Write down at once ... at once ... ‘that I snatched up the pestle to go
Enter Input : and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head
Enter Input : with it!’ Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your minds
Enter Input : relieved?” he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We quite understand that you made that statement just now through
Enter Input : exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consider
Enter Input : trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,” the prosecutor remarked
Enter Input : dryly in reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does one
Enter Input : pick things up for at such moments? I don’t know what for. I snatched it
Enter Input : up and ran—that’s all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or I declare I
Enter Input : won’t tell you any more.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He sat
Enter Input : sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of
Enter Input : nausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare that
Enter Input : he wouldn’t say another word, “not if you hang me for it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, gentlemen,” he said at last, with difficulty controlling
Enter Input : himself, “you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It’s a
Enter Input : dream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it—it’s always the same
Enter Input : ... that some one is hunting me, some one I’m awfully afraid of ... that
Enter Input : he’s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hide
Enter Input : somewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way,
Enter Input : and the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but he pretends not to
Enter Input : know where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror....
Enter Input : That’s just what you’re doing now. It’s just like that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is that the sort of thing you dream about?” inquired the prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it is. Don’t you want to write it down?” said Mitya, with a
Enter Input : distorted smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not a question of dreams now, gentlemen—this is realism, this is
Enter Input : real life! I’m a wolf and you’re the hunters. Well, hunt him down!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are wrong to make such comparisons ...” began Nikolay Parfenovitch,
Enter Input : with extraordinary softness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I’m not wrong, not at all!” Mitya flared up again, though his
Enter Input : outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more
Enter Input : good-humored at every word. “You may not trust a criminal or a man on
Enter Input : trial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable
Enter Input : impulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)—no! That you must believe you
Enter Input : have no right indeed ... but—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Be silent, heart,
Enter Input :     Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Well, shall I go on?” he broke off gloomily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you’ll be so kind,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. The Third Ordeal
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying more than
Enter Input : ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story. He told them how
Enter Input : he had leapt over the fence into his father’s garden; how he had gone up
Enter Input : to the window; told them all that had passed under the window. Clearly,
Enter Input : precisely, distinctly, he described the feelings that troubled him during
Enter Input : those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether
Enter Input : Grushenka was with his father or not. But, strange to say, both the
Enter Input : lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him,
Enter Input : asked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their faces.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’re angry and offended,” he thought. “Well, bother them!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the “signal” to
Enter Input : his father that Grushenka had come, so that he should open the window, the
Enter Input : lawyers paid no attention to the word “signal,” as though they entirely
Enter Input : failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection: so much so,
Enter Input : that Mitya noticed it. Coming at last to the moment when, seeing his
Enter Input : father peering out of the window, his hatred flared up and he pulled the
Enter Input : pestle out of his pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short.
Enter Input : He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well?” said the investigating lawyer. “You pulled out the weapon and ...
Enter Input : and what happened then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his
Enter Input : skull.... I suppose that’s your story. That’s it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with
Enter Input : extraordinary violence in his soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Our story?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. “Well—and yours?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,” he began softly. “Whether
Enter Input : it was some one’s tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angel
Enter Input : kissed me at that instant, I don’t know. But the devil was conquered. I
Enter Input : rushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was alarmed and,
Enter Input : for the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang back from the
Enter Input : window. I remember that very well. I ran across the garden to the fence
Enter Input : ... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners. They
Enter Input : seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention. A sort of
Enter Input : paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya’s soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you’re laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!” he broke off
Enter Input : suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What makes you think that?” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t believe one word—that’s why! I understand, of course, that I
Enter Input : have come to the vital point. The old man’s lying there now with his skull
Enter Input : broken, while I—after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him,
Enter Input : and how I snatched up the pestle—I suddenly run away from the window. A
Enter Input : romance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha!
Enter Input : You are scoffers, gentlemen!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did you notice,” asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not
Enter Input : observing Mitya’s excitement, “did you notice when you ran away from the
Enter Input : window, whether the door into the garden was open?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it was not open.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!” he seemed
Enter Input : suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, did you find the door open?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it was open.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?” cried
Enter Input : Mitya, greatly astonished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The door stood open, and your father’s murderer undoubtedly went in at
Enter Input : that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same
Enter Input : door,” the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out
Enter Input : each word separately. “That is perfectly clear. The murder was committed
Enter Input : in the room and _not through the __ window_; that is absolutely certain
Enter Input : from the examination that has been made, from the position of the body and
Enter Input : everything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But that’s utterly impossible!” he cried, completely at a loss. “I ... I
Enter Input : didn’t go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut the
Enter Input : whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden. I only
Enter Input : stood at the window and saw him through the window. That’s all, that’s
Enter Input : all.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didn’t remember, it would
Enter Input : be just the same. I know it, for no one knew the signals except
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he wouldn’t have opened the door
Enter Input : to any one in the world without the signals.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Signals? What signals?” asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almost
Enter Input : hysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and
Enter Input : dignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. He
Enter Input : scented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and was already
Enter Input : filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you didn’t know!” Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking
Enter Input : smile. “What if I won’t tell you? From whom could you find out? No one
Enter Input : knew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was all.
Enter Input : Heaven knew, too, but it won’t tell you. But it’s an interesting fact.
Enter Input : There’s no knowing what you might build on it. Ha ha! Take comfort,
Enter Input : gentlemen, I’ll reveal it. You’ve some foolish idea in your hearts. You
Enter Input : don’t know the man you have to deal with! You have to do with a prisoner
Enter Input : who gives evidence against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for I’m a man
Enter Input : of honor and you—are not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling with
Enter Input : impatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them
Enter Input : everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant, tapped the
Enter Input : signals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed
Enter Input : he, Mitya, had tapped the signal “Grushenka has come,” when he tapped to
Enter Input : his father, he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal, that
Enter Input : “Grushenka had come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So now you can build up your tower,” Mitya broke off, and again turned
Enter Input : away from them contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valet
Enter Input : Smerdyakov? And no one else?” Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven. That may
Enter Input : be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But while they
Enter Input : wrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all
Enter Input : responsibility for the death of your father, was it not he, perhaps, who
Enter Input : knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to open to him, and
Enter Input : then ... committed the crime?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred. His
Enter Input : silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve caught the fox again,” commented Mitya at last; “you’ve got the
Enter Input : beast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought,
Enter Input : of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout
Enter Input : with all my might, ‘Aie! it’s Smerdyakov; he’s the murderer.’ Confess
Enter Input : that’s what you thought. Confess, and I’ll go on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re mistaken. I’m not going to shout ‘It’s Smerdyakov,’ ” said Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you don’t even suspect him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, do you suspect him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is suspected, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Joking apart,” he brought out gloomily. “Listen. From the very beginning,
Enter Input : almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I’ve
Enter Input : had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I’ve been sitting here, shouting
Enter Input : that I’m innocent and thinking all the time ‘Smerdyakov!’ I can’t get
Enter Input : Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just
Enter Input : now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, ‘No, it’s not
Enter Input : Smerdyakov.’ It’s not his doing, gentlemen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In that case is there anybody else you suspect?” Nikolay Parfenovitch
Enter Input : inquired cautiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know any one it could be, whether it’s the hand of Heaven or
Enter Input : Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,” Mitya jerked out with decision.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it’s not
Enter Input : he?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From my conviction—my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most
Enter Input : abject character and a coward. He’s not a coward, he’s the epitome of all
Enter Input : the cowardice in the world walking on two legs. He has the heart of a
Enter Input : chicken. When he talked to me, he was always trembling for fear I should
Enter Input : kill him, though I never raised my hand against him. He fell at my feet
Enter Input : and blubbered; he has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching me
Enter Input : ‘not to frighten him.’ Do you hear? ‘Not to frighten him.’ What a thing to
Enter Input : say! Why, I offered him money. He’s a puling chicken—sickly, epileptic,
Enter Input : weak-minded—a child of eight could thrash him. He has no character worth
Enter Input : talking about. It’s not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He doesn’t care for money;
Enter Input : he wouldn’t take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for murdering
Enter Input : the old man? Why, he’s very likely his son, you know—his natural son. Do
Enter Input : you know that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We have heard that legend. But you are your father’s son, too, you know;
Enter Input : yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I’m not afraid! Oh,
Enter Input : gentlemen, isn’t it too base of you to say that to my face? It’s base,
Enter Input : because I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him, but I
Enter Input : might have done it. And, what’s more, I went out of my way to tell you of
Enter Input : my own accord that I nearly murdered him. But, you see, I didn’t murder
Enter Input : him; you see, my guardian angel saved me—that’s what you’ve not taken into
Enter Input : account. And that’s why it’s so base of you. For I didn’t kill him, I
Enter Input : didn’t kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during the whole
Enter Input : interrogation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what has he told you, gentlemen—Smerdyakov, I mean?” he added
Enter Input : suddenly, after a pause. “May I ask that question?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You may ask any question,” the prosecutor replied with frigid severity,
Enter Input : “any question relating to the facts of the case, and we are, I repeat,
Enter Input : bound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the servant Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his bed, in an epileptic
Enter Input : fit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly, ten times. The
Enter Input : doctor who was with us told us, after seeing him, that he may possibly not
Enter Input : outlive the night.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if that’s so, the devil must have killed him,” broke suddenly from
Enter Input : Mitya, as though until that moment he had been asking himself: “Was it
Enter Input : Smerdyakov or not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We will come back to this later,” Nikolay Parfenovitch decided. “Now,
Enter Input : wouldn’t you like to continue your statement?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted. After
Enter Input : resting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed. He was
Enter Input : exhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse the
Enter Input : prosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally, by vexatious
Enter Input : interruptions about “trifling points.” Scarcely had Mitya described how,
Enter Input : sitting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle,
Enter Input : while the old man had hold of his left leg, and how he had then jumped
Enter Input : down to look at him, when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to
Enter Input : describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall and
Enter Input : one on the other.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the pestle?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The pestle was in my hand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent blow
Enter Input : you gave him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and
Enter Input : showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” asked Mitya, looking haughtily at
Enter Input : the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This was how I struck him! That’s how I knocked him down! What more do
Enter Input : you want?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with
Enter Input : what object, and what you had in view?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I’d hurt ... I don’t
Enter Input : know what for!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Though you were so excited and were running away?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, though I was excited and running away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You wanted to help him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I don’t remember.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t remember? Then you didn’t quite know what you were doing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all. I remember everything—every detail. I jumped down to look at
Enter Input : him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to
Enter Input : consciousness?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure whether he
Enter Input : was alive or not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m not a doctor. I couldn’t decide. I ran away thinking I’d killed him.
Enter Input : And now he’s recovered.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excellent,” commented the prosecutor. “Thank you. That’s all I wanted.
Enter Input : Kindly proceed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alas! it never entered Mitya’s head to tell them, though he remembered it,
Enter Input : that he had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate figure
Enter Input : had even uttered some words of regret: “You’ve come to grief, old
Enter Input : man—there’s no help for it. Well, there you must lie.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumped
Enter Input : back “at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of
Enter Input : ascertaining whether the _only_ witness of his crime were dead; that he
Enter Input : must therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision and
Enter Input : foresight even at such a moment,” ... and so on. The prosecutor was
Enter Input : satisfied: “I’ve provoked the nervous fellow by ‘trifles’ and he has said
Enter Input : more than he meant to.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled up
Enter Input : immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands so
Enter Input : covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, I didn’t notice the blood at all at the time,” answered Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s quite likely. It does happen sometimes.” The prosecutor exchanged
Enter Input : glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I simply didn’t notice. You’re quite right there, prosecutor,” Mitya
Enter Input : assented suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Next came the account of Mitya’s sudden determination to “step aside” and
Enter Input : make way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to open
Enter Input : his heart to them as before, and tell them about “the queen of his soul.”
Enter Input : He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons “who were
Enter Input : fastening on him like bugs.” And so in response to their reiterated
Enter Input : questions he answered briefly and abruptly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for? That
Enter Input : question stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come back,
Enter Input : the man who wronged her but who’d hurried back to offer his love, after
Enter Input : five years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew it was all
Enter Input : over for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that blood—Grigory’s.... What
Enter Input : had I to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load
Enter Input : them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And a grand feast the night before?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make
Enter Input : haste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the
Enter Input : village, and I’d planned to do it at five o’clock in the morning. And I
Enter Input : had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin’s when I loaded my
Enter Input : pistols. Here’s the letter. Read it! It’s not for you I tell it,” he added
Enter Input : contemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the
Enter Input : table. The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to
Enter Input : the papers connected with the case.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you didn’t even think of washing your hands at Perhotin’s? You were
Enter Input : not afraid then of arousing suspicion?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just the
Enter Input : same, and shot myself at five o’clock, and you wouldn’t have been in time
Enter Input : to do anything. If it hadn’t been for what’s happened to my father, you
Enter Input : would have known nothing about it, and wouldn’t have come here. Oh, it’s
Enter Input : the devil’s doing. It was the devil murdered father, it was through the
Enter Input : devil that you found it out so soon. How did you manage to get here so
Enter Input : quick? It’s marvelous, a dream!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in your
Enter Input : hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a
Enter Input : bundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his servant-boy saw it too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, there’s one little point presents itself. Can you inform us,”
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, “where did you get so
Enter Input : much money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from the
Enter Input : reckoning of time, that you had not been home?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor’s brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly,
Enter Input : but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t go home,” answered Mitya, apparently perfectly composed, but
Enter Input : looking at the floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me then to repeat my question,” Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as
Enter Input : though creeping up to the subject. “Where were you able to procure such a
Enter Input : sum all at once, when by your own confession, at five o’clock the same day
Enter Input : you—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin, and
Enter Input : then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she wouldn’t
Enter Input : give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,” Mitya interrupted sharply.
Enter Input : “Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands turned up,
Enter Input : eh? Do you know, gentlemen, you’re both afraid now ‘what if he won’t tell
Enter Input : us where he got it?’ That’s just how it is. I’m not going to tell you,
Enter Input : gentlemen. You’ve guessed right. You’ll never know,” said Mitya, chipping
Enter Input : out each word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent
Enter Input : for a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for us
Enter Input : to know,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand; but still I won’t tell you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that he
Enter Input : was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it to his
Enter Input : interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do himself by his
Enter Input : silence, especially in a case of such importance as—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I’ve heard that rigmarole
Enter Input : before,” Mitya interrupted again. “I can see for myself how important it
Enter Input : is, and that this is the vital point, and still I won’t say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it to us? It’s not our business, but yours. You are doing
Enter Input : yourself harm,” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, gentlemen, joking apart”—Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly
Enter Input : at them both—“I had an inkling from the first that we should come to
Enter Input : loggerheads at this point. But at first when I began to give my evidence,
Enter Input : it was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and I was so
Enter Input : simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing
Enter Input : between us. Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the
Enter Input : question, for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed
Enter Input : stumbling-block. And now we’ve come to it! It’s impossible and there’s an
Enter Input : end of it! But I don’t blame you. You can’t believe it all simply on my
Enter Input : word. I understand that, of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He relapsed into gloomy silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Couldn’t you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the
Enter Input : chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight hint as
Enter Input : to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to
Enter Input : refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I’ll tell you the
Enter Input : reason why and give you that hint, though you don’t deserve it. I won’t
Enter Input : speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my honor. The
Enter Input : answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far
Enter Input : greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I had
Enter Input : murdered and robbed him. That’s why I can’t tell you. I can’t for fear of
Enter Input : disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, we’ll write it down,” lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ought not to write that down about ‘disgrace.’ I only told you that
Enter Input : in the goodness of my heart. I needn’t have told you. I made you a present
Enter Input : of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once. Oh, well, write—write
Enter Input : what you like,” he concluded, with scornful disgust. “I’m not afraid of
Enter Input : you and I can still hold up my head before you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And can’t you tell us the nature of that disgrace?” Nikolay Parfenovitch
Enter Input : hazarded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor frowned darkly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, _c’est fini_, don’t trouble yourselves. It’s not worth while
Enter Input : soiling one’s hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.
Enter Input : You’re not worth it—no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. I’m not going on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist
Enter Input : further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch’s eyes he saw that he had not given
Enter Input : up hope.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when you
Enter Input : went into Mr. Perhotin’s—how many roubles exactly?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t tell you that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three thousand
Enter Input : from Madame Hohlakov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won’t say how much I had.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you
Enter Input : have done since you arrived?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh! you might ask the people here about that. But I’ll tell you if you
Enter Input : like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He proceeded to do so, but we won’t repeat his story. He told it dryly and
Enter Input : curtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but told them that he
Enter Input : abandoned his determination to shoot himself, owing to “new factors in the
Enter Input : case.” He told the story without going into motives or details. And this
Enter Input : time the lawyers did not worry him much. It was obvious that there was no
Enter Input : essential point of interest to them here.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the examination
Enter Input : of the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your presence,”
Enter Input : said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. “And now allow me to request you
Enter Input : to lay on the table everything in your possession, especially all the
Enter Input : money you still have about you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary. I’m
Enter Input : surprised, indeed, that you haven’t inquired about it before. It’s true I
Enter Input : couldn’t get away anywhere. I’m sitting here where I can be seen. But
Enter Input : here’s my money—count it—take it. That’s all, I think.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change—two pieces of
Enter Input : twenty copecks—he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket. They counted the
Enter Input : money, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles, and forty
Enter Input : copecks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And is that all?” asked the investigating lawyer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles
Enter Input : at Plotnikovs’. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver twenty, here you lost
Enter Input : two hundred, then....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily. They
Enter Input : recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at
Enter Input : first?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I suppose so,” snapped Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How is it they all assert there was much more?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let them assert it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you asserted it yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I did, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet
Enter Input : examined. Don’t be anxious about your money. It will be properly taken
Enter Input : care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning
Enter Input : ... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved that you have undisputed
Enter Input : right to it. Well, and now....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly that it
Enter Input : was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search “of
Enter Input : your clothes and everything else....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By all means, gentlemen. I’ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won’t you search me as I am! Can’t you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take off your
Enter Input : clothes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As you like,” Mitya submitted gloomily; “only, please, not here, but
Enter Input : behind the curtains. Who will search them?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Behind the curtains, of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore an
Enter Input : expression of peculiar solemnity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could
Enter Input : never, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like
Enter Input : that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was something
Enter Input : humiliating in it, and on their side something “supercilious and
Enter Input : scornful.” It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to
Enter Input : undress further, or rather not asked but “commanded,” he quite understood
Enter Input : that. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Several
Enter Input : peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the
Enter Input : curtain. “To be ready if force is required,” thought Mitya, “and perhaps
Enter Input : for some other reason, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, must I take off my shirt, too?” he asked sharply, but Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in
Enter Input : examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was
Enter Input : evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. “They make no
Enter Input : bones about it,” thought Mitya, “they don’t keep up the most elementary
Enter Input : politeness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ask you for the second time—need I take off my shirt or not?” he said,
Enter Input : still more sharply and irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,” Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it
Enter Input : seemed to Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.
Enter Input : There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the
Enter Input : back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were bloodstains
Enter Input : on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence of
Enter Input : the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and
Enter Input : all the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking for
Enter Input : something—money, of course. He didn’t even hide from Mitya his suspicion
Enter Input : that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,” Mitya muttered to
Enter Input : himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing
Enter Input : frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain,
Enter Input : fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch’s attention to
Enter Input : the cap, which they were also fingering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,” observed the secretary. “Last
Enter Input : summer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to have
Enter Input : lost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why, in just
Enter Input : such pipings in his cap. The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in
Enter Input : little rolls and sewed in the piping.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko’s case perfectly, and so laid aside
Enter Input : Mitya’s cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly
Enter Input : examined later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me,” cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the right
Enter Input : cuff of Mitya’s shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, “excuse me,
Enter Input : what’s that, blood?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” Mitya jerked out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after
Enter Input : Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at
Enter Input : Perhotin’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You must take off your shirt, too. That’s very important as material
Enter Input : evidence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, am I to stay naked?” he shouted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take off
Enter Input : your socks.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re not joking? Is that really necessary?” Mitya’s eyes flashed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are in no mood for joking,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if I must—” muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he took
Enter Input : off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he was
Enter Input : naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in
Enter Input : their presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he was
Enter Input : inferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one’s the
Enter Input : only one undressed and everybody is looking, it’s degrading,” he kept
Enter Input : repeating to himself, again and again. “It’s like a dream, I’ve sometimes
Enter Input : dreamed of being in such degrading positions.” It was a misery to him to
Enter Input : take off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were his underclothes,
Enter Input : and now every one could see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet.
Enter Input : All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularly
Enter Input : loathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they
Enter Input : would all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and
Enter Input : intentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Would you like to look anywhere else if you’re not ashamed to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, there’s no need to, at present.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, am I to stay naked like this?” he added savagely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that can’t be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a
Enter Input : while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... I’ll see
Enter Input : to all this.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search was
Enter Input : drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were
Enter Input : carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left
Enter Input : alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off
Enter Input : him. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet
Enter Input : stuck out, and he couldn’t pull the quilt over so as to cover them.
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, “an insufferable
Enter Input : time.” “He thinks of me as a puppy,” thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth.
Enter Input : “That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts
Enter Input : him to see me naked!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned
Enter Input : to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back
Enter Input : with quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a peasant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here are clothes for you,” he observed airily, seeming well satisfied
Enter Input : with the success of his mission. “Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these
Enter Input : for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he had them
Enter Input : all in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya flew into a passion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t have other people’s clothes!” he shouted menacingly, “give me my
Enter Input : own!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s impossible!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded
Enter Input : somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes,
Enter Input : being stained with blood, must be “included with the other material
Enter Input : evidence,” and that they “had not even the right to let him have them now
Enter Input : ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.” Mitya at
Enter Input : last understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly
Enter Input : dressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes
Enter Input : were much better than his old ones, and that he disliked “gaining by the
Enter Input : change.” The coat was, besides, “ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up
Enter Input : like a fool ... for your amusement?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only
Enter Input : a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. But
Enter Input : the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn it all! I can hardly button it,” Mitya grumbled. “Be so good as to
Enter Input : tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn’t ask for his clothes, and it’s not
Enter Input : my doing that they’ve dressed me up like a clown.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you his
Enter Input : clothes, but sorry about all this business,” mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was asked to go back to the “other room.” Mitya went in, scowling with
Enter Input : anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. Dressed in another man’s
Enter Input : clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, and
Enter Input : of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in the
Enter Input : doorway, and vanished immediately. “He’s come to look at me dressed up,”
Enter Input : thought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd
Enter Input : nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That’s all that’s left for
Enter Input : you,” he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He would
Enter Input : not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purpose
Enter Input : to show every one how dirty they were—the scoundrel!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,” observed
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya’s question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on
Enter Input : something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ve done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch went on, “but having received from you such an uncompromising
Enter Input : refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money
Enter Input : found upon you, we are, at the present moment—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is the stone in your ring?” Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though
Enter Input : awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large rings
Enter Input : adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch’s right hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ring?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it,
Enter Input : what stone is that?” Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a smoky topaz,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. “Would you
Enter Input : like to look at it? I’ll take it off ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, don’t take it off,” cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and
Enter Input : angry with himself. “Don’t take it off ... there’s no need.... Damn it!...
Enter Input : Gentlemen, you’ve sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would conceal
Enter Input : it from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie,
Enter Input : and hide myself? No, that’s not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn’t
Enter Input : do, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn’t have waited for your coming,
Enter Input : or for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself
Enter Input : before this, without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I
Enter Input : couldn’t have learnt so much in twenty years as I’ve found out in this
Enter Input : accursed night!... And should I have been like this on this night, and at
Enter Input : this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I have
Enter Input : moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, if
Enter Input : I had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought of
Enter Input : having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night—not from
Enter Input : fear—oh, not simply from fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And
Enter Input : you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and
Enter Input : believe in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another
Enter Input : nasty thing I’ve done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from
Enter Input : your accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my
Enter Input : father and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he?
Enter Input : I’m racking my brains and can’t think who. But I can tell you it was not
Enter Input : Dmitri Karamazov, and that’s all I can tell you, and that’s enough,
Enter Input : enough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but don’t bother me any
Enter Input : more. I’ll say no more. Call your witnesses!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be
Enter Input : absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the whole
Enter Input : time and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were the
Enter Input : most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well
Enter Input : inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of
Enter Input : the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us by
Enter Input : Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly and
Enter Input : emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming out
Enter Input : to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his mind to go
Enter Input : into it through the little gate which stood open, before he noticed you
Enter Input : running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open window
Enter Input : where you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while
Enter Input : noticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him,
Enter Input : the door, standing wide open—that door which you have stated to have been
Enter Input : shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from you
Enter Input : that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must
Enter Input : have run from that door, though, of course, he did not see you do so with
Enter Input : his own eyes, since he only noticed you first some distance away in the
Enter Input : garden, running towards the fence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense!” he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, “it’s a barefaced lie. He
Enter Input : couldn’t have seen the door open because it was shut. He’s lying!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He does
Enter Input : not waver. He adheres to it. We’ve cross-examined him several times.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,” Nikolay Parfenovitch
Enter Input : confirmed warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s false, false! It’s either an attempt to slander me, or the
Enter Input : hallucination of a madman,” Mitya still shouted. “He’s simply raving, from
Enter Input : loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he came to....
Enter Input : He’s raving.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after his
Enter Input : injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from the
Enter Input : lodge.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But it’s false, it’s false! It can’t be so! He’s slandering me from
Enter Input : spite.... He couldn’t have seen it ... I didn’t come from the door,”
Enter Input : gasped Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him
Enter Input : impressively:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Confront him with it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you recognize this object?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official
Enter Input : envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope was
Enter Input : empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It ... it must be that envelope of my father’s, the envelope that
Enter Input : contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there’s inscribed on it,
Enter Input : allow me, ‘For my little chicken’ ... yes—three thousand!” he shouted, “do
Enter Input : you see, three thousand, do you see?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course, we see. But we didn’t find the money in it. It was empty, and
Enter Input : lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, it’s Smerdyakov!” he shouted suddenly, at the top of his
Enter Input : voice. “It’s he who’s murdered him! He’s robbed him! No one else knew
Enter Input : where the old man hid the envelope. It’s Smerdyakov, that’s clear, now!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I never knew it. I’ve never seen it. This is the first time I’ve looked
Enter Input : at it. I’d only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only one who
Enter Input : knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn’t know ...” Mitya was
Enter Input : completely breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased
Enter Input : father’s pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so
Enter Input : you must have known it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ve got it written down,” confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense! It’s absurd! I’d no idea it was under the pillow. And perhaps
Enter Input : it wasn’t under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance guess that it
Enter Input : was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you asked him where
Enter Input : it was? What does Smerdyakov say? that’s the chief point.... And I went
Enter Input : out of my way to tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking
Enter Input : that it was under the pillow, and now you— Oh, you know how one says the
Enter Input : wrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, only
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn’t even tell me where it was! But
Enter Input : it’s his doing, his doing; there’s no doubt about it, he murdered him,
Enter Input : that’s as clear as daylight now,” Mitya exclaimed more and more
Enter Input : frantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more
Enter Input : exasperated and excited. “You must understand that, and arrest him at
Enter Input : once.... He must have killed him while I was running away and while
Enter Input : Grigory was unconscious, that’s clear now.... He gave the signal and
Enter Input : father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without
Enter Input : the signal father would never have opened the door....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you’re again forgetting the circumstance,” the prosecutor observed,
Enter Input : still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph,
Enter Input : “that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open
Enter Input : when you were there, while you were in the garden....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The door, the door,” muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the
Enter Input : prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, the door!... It’s a nightmare! God is against me!” he exclaimed,
Enter Input : staring before him in complete stupefaction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, you see,” the prosecutor went on with dignity, “and you can judge
Enter Input : for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence of
Enter Input : the open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us.
Enter Input : On the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak,
Enter Input : obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the
Enter Input : money which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours
Enter Input : earlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten
Enter Input : roubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we to
Enter Input : believe, and what can we depend upon? And don’t accuse us of being
Enter Input : ‘frigid, cynical, scoffing people,’ who are incapable of believing in the
Enter Input : generous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter into our position ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well!” he exclaimed suddenly. “I will tell you my secret. I’ll tell
Enter Input : you where I got the money!... I’ll reveal my shame, that I may not have to
Enter Input : blame myself or you hereafter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in a
Enter Input : voice of almost pathetic delight, “that every sincere and complete
Enter Input : confession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immense
Enter Input : influence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he checked
Enter Input : himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. Mitya’s Great Secret. Received With Hisses
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen,” he began, still in the same agitation, “I want to make a full
Enter Input : confession: that money was _my own_.” The lawyers’ faces lengthened. That
Enter Input : was not at all what they expected.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean?” faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, “when at five o’clock on
Enter Input : the same day, from your own confession—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn five o’clock on the same day and my own confession! That’s nothing
Enter Input : to do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is, stolen by me
Enter Input : ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen hundred
Enter Input : roubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But where did you get it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here,
Enter Input : round my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I’d had it round my neck a long time,
Enter Input : it’s a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And from whom did you ... appropriate it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You mean, ‘steal it’? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I
Enter Input : practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I ‘appropriated it.’ I consider
Enter Input : I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Last night? But you said that it’s a month since you ... obtained it?...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don’t be uneasy. I
Enter Input : didn’t steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you without
Enter Input : interrupting. It’s hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sent
Enter Input : for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you know her. She’s a noble creature, noblest of the noble. But
Enter Input : she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with good
Enter Input : reason, good reason!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katerina Ivanovna!” Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The
Enter Input : prosecutor, too, stared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, don’t take her name in vain! I’m a scoundrel to bring her into it.
Enter Input : Yes, I’ve seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very first,
Enter Input : even that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. You’re unworthy
Enter Input : even to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only tell you that
Enter Input : she sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to
Enter Input : her sister and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn’t have
Enter Input : sent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my
Enter Input : life when I ... well, in fact, when I’d just come to love another, her,
Enter Input : she’s sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroe
Enter Input : then, and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand, but the
Enter Input : other half I kept on me. Well, I’ve kept that other half, that fifteen
Enter Input : hundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent
Enter Input : it. What’s left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now,
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch. That’s the change out of the fifteen hundred I had
Enter Input : yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me. How’s that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent
Enter Input : three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you told every one yourself that you’d spent exactly three
Enter Input : thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so.
Enter Input : And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. Yet I
Enter Input : didn’t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteen
Enter Input : hundred I sewed into a little bag. That’s how it was, gentlemen. That’s
Enter Input : where I got that money yesterday....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is almost miraculous,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to inquire,” observed the prosecutor at last, “have you informed
Enter Input : any one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteen
Enter Input : hundred left about you a month ago?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I told no one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for making
Enter Input : such a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at last your
Enter Input : secret, in your words, so ‘disgraceful,’ though in reality—that is, of
Enter Input : course, comparatively speaking—this action, that is, the appropriation of
Enter Input : three thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only
Enter Input : for a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest
Enter Input : recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration
Enter Input : your character.... Even admitting that it was an action in the highest
Enter Input : degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not ‘disgraceful.’... Many
Enter Input : people have already guessed, during this last month, about the three
Enter Input : thousand of Katerina Ivanovna’s, that you have spent, and I heard the
Enter Input : legend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for
Enter Input : instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but
Enter Input : the gossip of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not
Enter Input : mistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the
Enter Input : money was Katerina Ivanovna’s, and so, it’s extremely surprising to me
Enter Input : that hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an
Enter Input : extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently
Enter Input : connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... It’s not easy
Enter Input : to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a
Enter Input : secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than
Enter Input : confessing it ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal his
Enter Input : vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated
Enter Input : spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not the fifteen hundred that’s the disgrace, but that I put it apart
Enter Input : from the rest of the three thousand,” said Mitya firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why?” smiled the prosecutor irritably. “What is there disgraceful, to
Enter Input : your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had
Enter Input : discreditably, if you prefer, ‘disgracefully,’ appropriated? Your taking
Enter Input : the three thousand is more important than what you did with it. And by the
Enter Input : way, why did you do that—why did you set apart that half, for what
Enter Input : purpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!” cried Mitya. “I put it
Enter Input : aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be
Enter Input : calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on
Enter Input : a whole month.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s incomprehensible.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I wonder at you. But I’ll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is
Enter Input : incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate three
Enter Input : thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all,
Enter Input : and next morning I go to her and say, ‘Katya, I’ve done wrong, I’ve
Enter Input : squandered your three thousand,’ well, is that right? No, it’s not
Enter Input : right—it’s dishonest and cowardly, I’m a beast, with no more self-control
Enter Input : than a beast, that’s so, isn’t it? But still I’m not a thief? Not a
Enter Input : downright thief, you’ll admit! I squandered it, but I didn’t steal it. Now
Enter Input : a second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may
Enter Input : get confused again—my head’s going round—and so, for the second
Enter Input : alternative: I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand,
Enter Input : that is, only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: ‘Katya, take
Enter Input : this fifteen hundred from me, I’m a low beast, and an untrustworthy
Enter Input : scoundrel, for I’ve wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so
Enter Input : keep me from temptation!’ Well, what of that alternative? I should be a
Enter Input : beast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not
Enter Input : altogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but
Enter Input : have kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back half,
Enter Input : I should pay back what I’d spent, that I should never give up trying to,
Enter Input : that I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should be
Enter Input : a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I admit that there is a certain distinction,” said the prosecutor, with a
Enter Input : cold smile. “But it’s strange that you see such a vital difference.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps
Enter Input : every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an
Enter Input : arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don’t know how to make these
Enter Input : fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that’s my
Enter Input : conviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make
Enter Input : up my mind to give it back to-morrow, and I’m a scoundrel no longer, but I
Enter Input : cannot make up my mind, you see, though I’m making up my mind every day,
Enter Input : and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I
Enter Input : can’t bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is that
Enter Input : right?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly, that’s not right, that I can quite understand, and that I
Enter Input : don’t dispute,” answered the prosecutor with reserve. “And let us give up
Enter Input : all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will be
Enter Input : so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have still not
Enter Input : told us, altogether we’ve asked you, why, in the first place, you halved
Enter Input : the money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For what purpose
Enter Input : exactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that fifteen
Enter Input : hundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, of course!” cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; “forgive
Enter Input : me, I’m worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or you’d
Enter Input : understand in a minute, for it’s just the motive of it that’s the
Enter Input : disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. He
Enter Input : was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous; I thought
Enter Input : then that she was hesitating between me and him. So I kept thinking every
Enter Input : day, suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she
Enter Input : were to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, ‘I love
Enter Input : you, not him; take me to the other end of the world.’ And I’d only forty
Enter Input : copecks; how could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I’d be lost. You
Enter Input : see, I didn’t know her then, I didn’t understand her, I thought she wanted
Enter Input : money, and that she wouldn’t forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly
Enter Input : counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on
Enter Input : it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off
Enter Input : to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have
Enter Input : squandered it all,” chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, “for after all what
Enter Input : does it amount to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, that I stole it, that’s what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify me
Enter Input : by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up
Enter Input : round my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, ‘You’re a thief!
Enter Input : you’re a thief!’ Yes, that’s why I’ve been so savage all this month,
Enter Input : that’s why I fought in the tavern, that’s why I attacked my father, it was
Enter Input : because I felt I was a thief. I couldn’t make up my mind, I didn’t dare
Enter Input : even to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was
Enter Input : such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried
Enter Input : it I said to myself at the same time every hour: ‘No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : you may yet not be a thief.’ Why? Because I might go next day and pay back
Enter Input : that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made up my mind to
Enter Input : tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya’s to Perhotin. I hadn’t
Enter Input : been able till that moment to bring myself to it. And it was only when I
Enter Input : tore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man
Enter Input : for the rest of my life. Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my
Enter Input : dream of going to Katya and saying, ‘I’m a scoundrel, but not a thief!’ Do
Enter Input : you understand now? Do you understand?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?” Nikolay Parfenovitch
Enter Input : interrupted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why? It’s absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five
Enter Input : o’clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no difference
Enter Input : whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it’s not so, it turns
Enter Input : out that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what has
Enter Input : tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I’d
Enter Input : killed the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my
Enter Input : love was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh, that did
Enter Input : torture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned
Enter Input : consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and
Enter Input : spent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you
Enter Input : again, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I
Enter Input : have learnt that it’s not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but
Enter Input : impossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his
Enter Input : being intensely excited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” the prosecutor
Enter Input : said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. “But all this, if
Enter Input : you’ll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... your
Enter Input : overwrought nerves, that’s what it is. And why, for instance, should you
Enter Input : not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going and
Enter Input : returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you?
Enter Input : And why could you not have explained things to her, and in view of your
Enter Input : position, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had
Enter Input : recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one’s mind,
Enter Input : that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her, why could you not
Enter Input : have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, with
Enter Input : her generous heart, she would certainly not have refused you in your
Enter Input : distress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on the
Enter Input : security you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I
Enter Input : suppose you still regard that security as of value?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya suddenly crimsoned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Surely you don’t think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You
Enter Input : can’t be speaking in earnest?” he said, with indignation, looking the
Enter Input : prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I assure you I’m in earnest.... Why do you imagine I’m not serious?” It
Enter Input : was the prosecutor’s turn to be surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are
Enter Input : torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I’ll confess all my
Enter Input : infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you’ll be surprised
Enter Input : yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions
Enter Input : can sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan you
Enter Input : spoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that
Enter Input : thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of
Enter Input : deciding to go to Katya—I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to
Enter Input : tell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out,
Enter Input : for the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to
Enter Input : beg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the
Enter Input : other, the rival, who hated and insulted her—to think of it! You must be
Enter Input : mad, prosecutor!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that
Enter Input : feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you
Enter Input : assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,” said the
Enter Input : prosecutor, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But that would have been so infamous!” Mitya brought his fist down on the
Enter Input : table fiercely. “That would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, do
Enter Input : you know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she would have
Enter Input : given it, too; she’d have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me,
Enter Input : she’d have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me,
Enter Input : for hers is an infernal nature, too, and she’s a woman of great wrath. I’d
Enter Input : have taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have taken
Enter Input : it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen,
Enter Input : I’m making such an outcry because I’ve had that thought in my mind so
Enter Input : lately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having all
Enter Input : that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I
Enter Input : remember, till that happened ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Till what happened?” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mitya
Enter Input : did not hear it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have made you an awful confession,” Mitya said gloomily in conclusion.
Enter Input : “You must appreciate it, and what’s more, you must respect it, for if not,
Enter Input : if that leaves your souls untouched, then you’ve simply no respect for me,
Enter Input : gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessed
Enter Input : it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already
Enter Input : that you don’t believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?” he
Enter Input : cried in dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, what you said just now,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at him
Enter Input : in surprise, “that is, that up to the last hour you were still
Enter Input : contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... I
Enter Input : assure you, that’s a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you,
Enter Input : particularly important for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have mercy, gentlemen!” Mitya flung up his hands. “Don’t write that,
Enter Input : anyway; have some shame. Here I’ve torn my heart asunder before you, and
Enter Input : you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves....
Enter Input : Oh, my God!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In despair he hid his face in his hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” observed the prosecutor,
Enter Input : “everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and
Enter Input : what you don’t agree to we’ll alter as you like. But now I’ll ask you one
Enter Input : little question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heard
Enter Input : from you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost
Enter Input : impossible to believe.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one, no one, I told you so before, or you’ve not understood anything!
Enter Input : Let me alone!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there’s plenty of
Enter Input : time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses
Enter Input : that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere
Enter Input : about the three thousand you’d spent here; three thousand, not fifteen
Enter Input : hundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday,
Enter Input : you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand
Enter Input : with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses,
Enter Input : two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!” cried Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ means
Enter Input : something.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what need had you to ‘talk rot,’ as you call it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much
Enter Input : money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes,
Enter Input : that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?
Enter Input : Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I’d said it, I didn’t
Enter Input : care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man
Enter Input : tell lies,” observed the prosecutor impressively. “Tell me, though, was
Enter Input : that ‘amulet,’ as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not big.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How big, for instance?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the size.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damnation, what nonsense! I don’t know where they are.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According to
Enter Input : your own evidence you didn’t go home.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When I was going from Fenya’s to Perhotin’s, on the way I tore it off my
Enter Input : neck and took out the money.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the dark?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one minute.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Without scissors, in the street?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag. It
Enter Input : was torn in a minute.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where did you put it afterwards?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I dropped it there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where was it, exactly?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows whereabouts.
Enter Input : What do you want to know for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be material
Enter Input : evidence in your favor. How is it you don’t understand that? Who helped
Enter Input : you to sew it up a month ago?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one helped me. I did it myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you sew?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed the
Enter Input : money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you laughing at me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know where I got the rag from—somewhere, I suppose.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should have thought you couldn’t have forgotten it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Upon my word, I don’t remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the
Enter Input : shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag was
Enter Input : it, cloth or linen?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didn’t tear
Enter Input : it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it up in a
Enter Input : cap of my landlady’s.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In your landlady’s cap?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. I took it from her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How did you get it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my pen
Enter Input : on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore it
Enter Input : up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it was in that
Enter Input : very rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you remember that for certain now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang
Enter Input : it, what does it matter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, she won’t, she didn’t miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an old
Enter Input : rag not worth a farthing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And where did you get the needle and thread?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll stop now. I won’t say any more. Enough of it!” said Mitya, losing
Enter Input : his temper at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw
Enter Input : the pieces in the market-place.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhaps
Enter Input : you’ll find it,” said Mitya, sneering. “Enough, gentlemen, enough!” he
Enter Input : decided, in an exhausted voice. “I see you don’t believe me! Not for a
Enter Input : moment! It’s my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why,
Enter Input : why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? It’s a joke to
Enter Input : you. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a
Enter Input : hymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you torturers!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were silent.
Enter Input : A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly. His
Enter Input : face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat mute and passive
Enter Input : as though hardly conscious of what was happening. In the meantime they had
Enter Input : to finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examining
Enter Input : the witnesses. It was by now eight o’clock in the morning. The lights had
Enter Input : been extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been
Enter Input : continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had
Enter Input : been going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very
Enter Input : tired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain
Enter Input : streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “May I look out of the window?” he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, as much as you like,” the latter replied.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its little
Enter Input : greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the house, and
Enter Input : farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts,
Enter Input : looking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought of “Phœbus the
Enter Input : golden-haired,” and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray.
Enter Input : “Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,” he thought with
Enter Input : a smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his
Enter Input : “torturers.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen,” he cried, “I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about her,
Enter Input : I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? She’s innocent, you
Enter Input : know, she was out of her mind when she cried last night ‘It’s all my
Enter Input : fault!’ She’s done nothing, nothing! I’ve been grieving over her all night
Enter Input : as I sat with you.... Can’t you, won’t you tell me what you are going to
Enter Input : do with her now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,”
Enter Input : the prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity. “We have, so far,
Enter Input : no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested. I
Enter Input : trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case.... On
Enter Input : the contrary, we’ll do everything that lies in our power in that matter.
Enter Input : Set your mind completely at rest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward
Enter Input : people in spite of everything. You’ve taken a load off my heart.... Well,
Enter Input : what are we to do now? I’m ready.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnesses
Enter Input : without delay. That must be done in your presence and therefore—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Shouldn’t we have some tea first?” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, “I
Enter Input : think we’ve deserved it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had, no
Enter Input : doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then “go on and
Enter Input : on,” putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable
Enter Input : opportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya at
Enter Input : first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him,
Enter Input : but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked
Enter Input : surprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculean
Enter Input : strength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent
Enter Input : emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he could
Enter Input : hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects about him
Enter Input : seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. “A little more and I shall
Enter Input : begin raving,” he said to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our story
Enter Input : in such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his
Enter Input : evidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he would
Enter Input : afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every witness was
Enter Input : called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and so on. We will only
Enter Input : note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the
Enter Input : question of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here,
Enter Input : at Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand
Enter Input : or fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen
Enter Input : hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned out to
Enter Input : be against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some witnesses
Enter Input : introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his, Mitya’s,
Enter Input : story.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not in the
Enter Input : least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the contrary, an
Enter Input : air of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him an
Enter Input : appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity. He spoke little, and with
Enter Input : reserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and deliberately.
Enter Input : Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month
Enter Input : before could not have been less than three thousand, that all the peasants
Enter Input : about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand
Enter Input : mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. “What a lot of money he flung
Enter Input : away on the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them
Enter Input : alone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t believe I gave them five hundred,” was Mitya’s gloomy comment on
Enter Input : this. “It’s a pity I didn’t count the money at the time, but I was
Enter Input : drunk....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He listened
Enter Input : gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he would say:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” retorted Trifon
Enter Input : Borissovitch firmly. “You flung it about at random and they picked it up.
Enter Input : They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers, they’ve been driven
Enter Input : away from here, or maybe they’d bear witness themselves how much they got
Enter Input : from you. I saw the sum in your hands, myself—count it I didn’t, you
Enter Input : didn’t let me, that’s true enough—but by the look of it I should say it
Enter Input : was far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We’ve seen
Enter Input : money too. We can judge of amounts....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had
Enter Input : told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three thousand with
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?” replied Mitya. “Surely I
Enter Input : didn’t declare so positively that I’d brought three thousand?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andrey
Enter Input : himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when you were
Enter Input : treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave your
Enter Input : sixth thousand here—that is with what you spent before, we must
Enter Input : understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too,
Enter Input : was standing beside you at the time. Maybe he’d remember it....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The evidence as to the “sixth” thousand made an extraordinary impression
Enter Input : on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning;
Enter Input : three and three made six, three thousand then and three now made six, that
Enter Input : was clear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch, Stepan
Enter Input : and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The peasants and the driver
Enter Input : unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch’s evidence. They noted down,
Enter Input : with particular care, Andrey’s account of the conversation he had had with
Enter Input : Mitya on the road: “ ‘Where,’ says he, ‘am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going,
Enter Input : to heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile, and
Enter Input : ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : would go should be “included in the case.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored, and
Enter Input : he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his
Enter Input : life, though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day
Enter Input : for a long time past. He began by saying that “he knew nothing about it
Enter Input : and didn’t want to.” But it appeared that he had heard of the “sixth”
Enter Input : thousand, and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the
Enter Input : moment. As far as he could see he “didn’t know” how much money Mitya had
Enter Input : in his hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply to
Enter Input : reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned out,
Enter Input : Mitya’s position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved, and
Enter Input : that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna
Enter Input : with reserve and respect, as though she had been a lady of the best
Enter Input : society, and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka. In spite of
Enter Input : the young man’s obvious repugnance at giving evidence, Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch examined him at great length, and only from him learnt all
Enter Input : the details of what made up Mitya’s “romance,” so to say, on that night.
Enter Input : Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go,
Enter Input : and he left the room with unconcealed indignation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in their room,
Enter Input : they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police officers
Enter Input : they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would certainly be
Enter Input : sent for. They gave their evidence with dignity, though not without some
Enter Input : uneasiness. The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the
Enter Input : twelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name
Enter Input : was Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated
Enter Input : dentist. Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering
Enter Input : the room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was
Enter Input : standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most important
Enter Input : person and in command, and addressed him at every word as “Pan Colonel.”
Enter Input : Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they grasped
Enter Input : that they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It
Enter Input : turned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their
Enter Input : accent in some words. Of his relations with Grushenka, past and present,
Enter Input : Pan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at
Enter Input : once and declared that he would not allow the “scoundrel” to speak like
Enter Input : that in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the
Enter Input : word “scoundrel” and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.
Enter Input : Mitya fumed with rage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, too,
Enter Input : that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he’s a scoundrel!” he
Enter Input : cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he showed the
Enter Input : most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly reprimanding Mitya,
Enter Input : he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case, and
Enter Input : hastened to pass to what was essential. One piece of evidence given by the
Enter Input : Poles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very
Enter Input : room, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him
Enter Input : three thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down,
Enter Input : and the remaining two thousand three hundred “to be paid next day in the
Enter Input : town.” He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at
Enter Input : Mokroe, but that his money was in the town. Mitya observed hotly that he
Enter Input : had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in
Enter Input : the town. But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after
Enter Input : thinking for a moment admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the
Enter Input : Poles stated, that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have
Enter Input : said so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It seemed to
Enter Input : establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base this deduction
Enter Input : on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had come into
Enter Input : Mitya’s hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town, or
Enter Input : even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe. This would explain the
Enter Input : circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only eight hundred
Enter Input : roubles were to be found in Mitya’s hands. This circumstance had been the
Enter Input : one piece of evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told,
Enter Input : to some extent, in Mitya’s favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his
Enter Input : favor had broken down. In answer to the prosecutor’s inquiry, where he
Enter Input : would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he
Enter Input : himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently
Enter Input : replied that he had meant to offer the “little chap,” not money, but a
Enter Input : formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya,
Enter Input : those rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov.
Enter Input : The prosecutor positively smiled at the “innocence of this subterfuge.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for
Enter Input : two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He certainly would have accepted it,” Mitya declared warmly. “Why, look
Enter Input : here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for it. He
Enter Input : would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and might have
Enter Input : got, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the old man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the protocol
Enter Input : in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The incident of the
Enter Input : cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay Parfenovitch was too
Enter Input : well pleased with them, as it was, and did not want to worry them with
Enter Input : trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a foolish, drunken quarrel over
Enter Input : cards. There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night.... So the
Enter Input : two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached with little
Enter Input : steps, looking very disheveled and depressed. He had, all this time, taken
Enter Input : refuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her, and “now and then
Enter Input : he’d begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue check
Enter Input : handkerchief,” as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she
Enter Input : herself began trying to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once
Enter Input : confessed that he had done wrong, that he had borrowed “ten roubles in my
Enter Input : poverty,” from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.
Enter Input : To Nikolay Parfenovitch’s direct question, had he noticed how much money
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have been able to see the
Enter Input : sum better than any one when he took the note from him, Maximov, in the
Enter Input : most positive manner, declared that there was twenty thousand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?” inquired
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my
Enter Input : little property. She’d only let me look at it from a distance, boasting of
Enter Input : it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored notes. And
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s were all rainbow-colored....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka’s turn. Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might
Enter Input : have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition to him, but Mitya
Enter Input : bowed his head in silence, giving him to understand “that he would not
Enter Input : make a scene.” Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in. She entered
Enter Input : with a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed and sat down
Enter Input : quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very
Enter Input : pale, she seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her
Enter Input : magnificent black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish
Enter Input : chill—the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her
Enter Input : grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorable
Enter Input : impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit
Enter Input : “fascinated.” He admitted himself, when talking about it afterwards, that
Enter Input : only then had he seen “how handsome the woman was,” for, though he had
Enter Input : seen her several times before, he had always looked upon her as something
Enter Input : of a “provincial hetaira.” “She has the manners of the best society,” he
Enter Input : said enthusiastically, gossiping about her in a circle of ladies. But this
Enter Input : was received with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediately
Enter Input : called him a “naughty man,” to his great satisfaction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya,
Enter Input : who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at once. After the
Enter Input : first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her,
Enter Input : hesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous manner, on what
Enter Input : terms she was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
Enter Input : To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance during the
Enter Input : last month.” To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and
Enter Input : with complete frankness, that, though “at times” she had thought him
Enter Input : attractive, she had not loved him, but had won his heart as well as his
Enter Input : old father’s “in my nasty spite,” that she had seen that Mitya was very
Enter Input : jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only amused
Enter Input : her. She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been
Enter Input : laughing at him. “I had no thoughts for either of them all this last
Enter Input : month. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,” she
Enter Input : said in conclusion, “that there’s no need for you to inquire about that,
Enter Input : nor for me to answer you, for that’s my own affair.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissed
Enter Input : the “romantic” aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is,
Enter Input : to the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles.
Enter Input : Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had
Enter Input : certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had
Enter Input : not counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand
Enter Input : from Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s own lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear
Enter Input : him speak of it to others in your presence?” the prosecutor inquired
Enter Input : immediately.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other
Enter Input : people, and had heard him say so when they were alone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?” inquired the
Enter Input : prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.
Enter Input : Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money
Enter Input : had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not
Enter Input : three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that
Enter Input : sum for his own use?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I never heard that,” answered Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her
Enter Input : that he hadn’t a farthing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was always expecting to get some from his father,” said Grushenka in
Enter Input : conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,”
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, “that he intended to make an attempt
Enter Input : on his father’s life?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ach, he did say so,” sighed Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Once or several times?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He mentioned it several times, always in anger.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did you believe he would do it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I never believed it,” she answered firmly. “I had faith in his noble
Enter Input : heart.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, allow me,” cried Mitya suddenly, “allow me to say one word to
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can speak,” Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Agrafena Alexandrovna!” Mitya got up from his chair, “have faith in God
Enter Input : and in me. I am not guilty of my father’s murder!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair. Grushenka
Enter Input : stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. “Thanks be to Thee,
Enter Input : O Lord,” she said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still standing,
Enter Input : she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He’ll say anything as a
Enter Input : joke or from obstinacy, but he’ll never deceive you against his
Enter Input : conscience. He’s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you’ve given me fresh courage,” Mitya
Enter Input : responded in a quivering voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not know
Enter Input : what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had three
Enter Input : thousand with him. And to the question where he got the money, she said
Enter Input : that he had told her that he had “stolen” it from Katerina Ivanovna, and
Enter Input : that she had replied to that that he hadn’t stolen it, and that he must
Enter Input : pay the money back next day. On the prosecutor’s asking her emphatically
Enter Input : whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he
Enter Input : had spent yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she
Enter Input : declared that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was how
Enter Input : she understood him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her
Enter Input : impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could
Enter Input : be of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she would care
Enter Input : for an escort, he ... would be—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thank you sincerely,” said Grushenka, bowing to him, “I’m going with
Enter Input : this old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and meanwhile,
Enter Input : if you’ll allow me, I’ll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only for
Enter Input : a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness.
Enter Input : His eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the witnesses was,
Enter Input : at last, over. They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya
Enter Input : got up, moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a
Enter Input : large chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the
Enter Input : time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed long
Enter Input : ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses,
Enter Input : through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November, and the
Enter Input : snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched the
Enter Input : earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair, long beard. He
Enter Input : was not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on a gray peasant’s
Enter Input : smock. Not far off was a village, he could see the black huts, and half
Enter Input : the huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.
Enter Input : And as they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a
Enter Input : lot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of
Enter Input : brownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman, who looked
Enter Input : forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin face. And in her
Enter Input : arms was a little baby crying. And her breasts seemed so dried up that
Enter Input : there was not a drop of milk in them. And the child cried and cried, and
Enter Input : held out its little bare arms, with its little fists blue from cold.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are they crying? Why are they crying?” Mitya asked, as they dashed
Enter Input : gayly by.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s the babe,” answered the driver, “the babe weeping.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, “the babe,” and he
Enter Input : liked the peasant’s calling it a “babe.” There seemed more pity in it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why is it weeping?” Mitya persisted stupidly, “why are its little
Enter Input : arms bare? Why don’t they wrap it up?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The babe’s cold, its little clothes are frozen and don’t warm it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why is it? Why?” foolish Mitya still persisted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, they’re poor people, burnt out. They’ve no bread. They’re begging
Enter Input : because they’ve been burnt out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no,” Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. “Tell me why it is
Enter Input : those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe poor?
Enter Input : Why is the steppe barren? Why don’t they hug each other and kiss? Why
Enter Input : don’t they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black misery? Why
Enter Input : don’t they feed the babe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,
Enter Input : yet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way. And
Enter Input : he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, was
Enter Input : rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do something
Enter Input : for them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that the
Enter Input : dark-faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tears
Enter Input : again from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at once,
Enter Input : regardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I’m coming with you. I won’t leave you now for the rest of my life,
Enter Input : I’m coming with you,” he heard close beside him Grushenka’s tender voice,
Enter Input : thrilling with emotion. And his heart glowed, and he struggled forward
Enter Input : towards the light, and he longed to live, to live, to go on and on,
Enter Input : towards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What! Where?” he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the chest,
Enter Input : as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the
Enter Input : protocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an
Enter Input : hour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenly
Enter Input : struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head, which hadn’t
Enter Input : been there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?” he cried, with a
Enter Input : sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some great
Enter Input : kindness had been shown him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant
Enter Input : witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch’s little secretary, had compassionately
Enter Input : thought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole soul was quivering
Enter Input : with tears. He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they
Enter Input : liked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve had a good dream, gentlemen,” he said in a strange voice, with a new
Enter Input : light, as of joy, in his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IX. They Carry Mitya Away
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to
Enter Input : the prisoner and read him the “Committal,” setting forth, that in such a
Enter Input : year, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer of
Enter Input : such-and-such a district court, having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya)
Enter Input : accused of this and of that (all the charges were carefully written out)
Enter Input : and having considered that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges
Enter Input : made against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while the
Enter Input : witnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such
Enter Input : testify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of
Enter Input : the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order to preclude
Enter Input : so-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he be
Enter Input : detained in such-and-such a prison, which he hereby notifies to the
Enter Input : accused and communicates a copy of this same “Committal” to the deputy
Enter Input : prosecutor, and so on, and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a prisoner,
Enter Input : and that he would be driven at once to the town, and there shut up in a
Enter Input : very unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged his
Enter Input : shoulders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, gentlemen, I don’t blame you. I’m ready.... I understand that
Enter Input : there’s nothing else for you to do.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at once
Enter Input : by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be on
Enter Input : the spot....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay,” Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable
Enter Input : feeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, we’re all cruel, we’re all monsters, we all make men weep, and
Enter Input : mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now,
Enter Input : of all I am the lowest reptile! I’ve sworn to amend, and every day I’ve
Enter Input : done the same filthy things. I understand now that such men as I need a
Enter Input : blow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a
Enter Input : force from without. Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the
Enter Input : thunderbolt has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public
Enter Input : shame, I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I
Enter Input : shall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not
Enter Input : guilty of my father’s blood. I accept my punishment, not because I killed
Enter Input : him, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really might have
Enter Input : killed him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I warn you of that.
Enter Input : I’ll fight it out with you to the end, and then God will decide. Good-by,
Enter Input : gentlemen, don’t be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the
Enter Input : examination. Oh, I was still such a fool then.... In another minute I
Enter Input : shall be a prisoner, but now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri
Enter Input : Karamazov offers you his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to all
Enter Input : men.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay
Enter Input : Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden, almost
Enter Input : nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya instantly noticed
Enter Input : this, and started. He let his outstretched hand fall at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,” Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered,
Enter Input : somewhat embarrassed. “We will continue it in the town, and I, for my
Enter Input : part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your defense....
Enter Input : As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I’ve always been disposed to
Enter Input : regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty. All of us here,
Enter Input : if I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready to recognize that
Enter Input : you are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas, one who has been
Enter Input : carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay Parfenovitch’s little figure was positively majestic by the time
Enter Input : he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another minute this
Enter Input : “boy” would take his arm, lead him to another corner, and renew their
Enter Input : conversation about “girls.” But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate
Enter Input : thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to
Enter Input : execution.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _her_ to say ‘good-by’
Enter Input : for the last time?” asked Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it’s impossible except in the
Enter Input : presence of—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words,
Enter Input : and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka made a deep bow
Enter Input : to Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow you for
Enter Input : ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though
Enter Input : you’ve been your own undoing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went out. He
Enter Input : was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him. At the
Enter Input : bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day
Enter Input : before with Andrey’s three horses, two carts stood in readiness. Mavriky
Enter Input : Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed
Enter Input : about something, some sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He
Enter Input : asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a different
Enter Input : face,” thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was a crowd of
Enter Input : people, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down the
Enter Input : steps too. All stared at Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me at parting, good people!” Mitya shouted suddenly from the
Enter Input : cart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive us too!” he heard two or three voices.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps, too
Enter Input : busy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something. It appeared that
Enter Input : everything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two constables
Enter Input : were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had been ordered
Enter Input : to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly maintaining
Enter Input : that it was not his turn to go, but Akim’s. But Akim was not to be seen.
Enter Input : They ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They’ve no shame!”
Enter Input : exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. “Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the day
Enter Input : before yesterday. You’ve drunk it all and now you cry out. I’m simply
Enter Input : surprised at your good-nature, with our low peasants, Mavriky
Enter Input : Mavrikyevitch, that’s all I can say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what do we want a second cart for?” Mitya put in. “Let’s start with
Enter Input : the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won’t be unruly, I won’t run away from
Enter Input : you, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you’ve never been
Enter Input : taught. I’m not ‘old fellow’ to you, and you can keep your advice for
Enter Input : another time!” Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as though glad
Enter Input : to vent his wrath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment later he felt
Enter Input : suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was still
Enter Input : overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve taken a chill,” thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down heavily,
Enter Input : and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the corner. It is
Enter Input : true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had been
Enter Input : laid upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!” Mitya shouted again, and felt himself,
Enter Input : that he had not called out this time from good-nature, but involuntarily,
Enter Input : from resentment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his back,
Enter Input : and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he made no
Enter Input : reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!” he heard all at once the voice of
Enter Input : Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he held out
Enter Input : his hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya had time to seize and press his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, dear fellow! I shan’t forget your generosity,” he cried warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and
Enter Input : Mitya was driven off.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face in
Enter Input : his hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that, crying
Enter Input : as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty. Oh, he
Enter Input : believed almost without doubt in Mitya’s guilt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are these people? What can men be after this?” he exclaimed
Enter Input : incoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that moment he had
Enter Input : no desire to live.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it worth it? Is it worth it?” exclaimed the boy in his grief.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book X. The Boys
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost, eleven
Enter Input : degrees Réaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the
Enter Input : frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and
Enter Input : blowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the
Enter Input : market-place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov’s shop, there stood a
Enter Input : small house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to Madame
Enter Input : Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been dead
Enter Input : for fourteen years. His widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two,
Enter Input : was living in her neat little house on her private means. She lived in
Enter Input : respectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition.
Enter Input : She was about eighteen at the time of her husband’s death; she had been
Enter Input : married only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of his
Enter Input : death she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her
Enter Input : precious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately
Enter Input : those fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than happiness.
Enter Input : She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid
Enter Input : he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a
Enter Input : chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When Kolya began going to
Enter Input : school, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him
Enter Input : so as to help him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened to
Enter Input : make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to
Enter Input : Kolya’s schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving
Enter Input : Kolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far
Enter Input : that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him
Enter Input : with being a “mother’s darling.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy, “tremendously
Enter Input : strong,” as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to be the fact; he
Enter Input : was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper. He
Enter Input : was good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he could
Enter Input : beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Though
Enter Input : he looked down upon every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious.
Enter Input : He accepted his schoolfellows’ respect as his due, but was friendly with
Enter Input : them. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself
Enter Input : on occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped
Enter Input : that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach
Enter Input : of discipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion
Enter Input : as the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of
Enter Input : mischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something
Enter Input : effective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make even
Enter Input : his mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her.
Enter Input : She gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one
Enter Input : thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her. She
Enter Input : was always fancying that Kolya was “unfeeling” to her, and at times,
Enter Input : dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him with his
Enter Input : coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feeling
Enter Input : were demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them. Yet
Enter Input : it was not intentional on his part but instinctive—it was his character.
Enter Input : His mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He only disliked
Enter Input : “sheepish sentimentality,” as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his
Enter Input : father’s. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them by
Enter Input : himself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at
Enter Input : seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead
Enter Input : of going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for
Enter Input : his age.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his mischief, he
Enter Input : had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm. It
Enter Input : is true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild mad
Enter Input : recklessness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and son
Enter Input : went to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with a
Enter Input : distant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway station
Enter Input : (the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month later
Enter Input : Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There Kolya began by
Enter Input : carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowing
Enter Input : that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly
Enter Input : acquired knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the place
Enter Input : with whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the station,
Enter Input : others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all between
Enter Input : twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town. The boys played
Enter Input : together, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya’s stay at the station, a
Enter Input : mad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest
Enter Input : of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was
Enter Input : moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he
Enter Input : would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o’clock train
Enter Input : was due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over
Enter Input : him at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation, from
Enter Input : which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails
Enter Input : that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was no
Enter Input : joke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at
Enter Input : him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on.
Enter Input : What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses
Enter Input : at him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as “a
Enter Input : small boy,” not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable
Enter Input : insult.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station,
Enter Input : so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the
Enter Input : station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. At
Enter Input : the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had
Enter Input : taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts
Enter Input : beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last
Enter Input : they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.
Enter Input : Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it
Enter Input : approached.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Run, run away from the rails,” the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes,
Enter Input : breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew
Enter Input : past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling
Enter Input : at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word.
Enter Input : Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to
Enter Input : frighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as
Enter Input : he confessed long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as “a
Enter Input : desperate character,” was established for ever. He returned home to the
Enter Input : station as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous
Enter Input : fever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The
Enter Input : incident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the town
Enter Input : it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters. But
Enter Input : then Kolya’s mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy’s behalf,
Enter Input : and in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exerted
Enter Input : himself in his favor, and the affair was ignored.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in love
Enter Input : with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about a
Enter Input : year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of his
Enter Input : sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage. But she
Enter Input : refused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an act of
Enter Input : treachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certain
Enter Input : mysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an object of
Enter Input : aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya’s
Enter Input : mad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for
Enter Input : his intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was
Enter Input : a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy
Enter Input : that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy. He was
Enter Input : fond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win
Enter Input : him over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, kept
Enter Input : him at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he was
Enter Input : second in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class
Enter Input : firmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he could
Enter Input : “beat” even Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, “Who
Enter Input : founded Troy?” to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring
Enter Input : to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period,
Enter Input : to the mythical legends. But the question, “Who had founded Troy?” that
Enter Input : is, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for some reason
Enter Input : regarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the boys remained
Enter Input : convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of
Enter Input : the founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in
Enter Input : his father’s bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the
Enter Input : question, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell
Enter Input : his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya’s
Enter Input : attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard of
Enter Input : her son’s exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She had
Enter Input : such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several
Enter Input : days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor that
Enter Input : such pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the
Enter Input : holy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin’s
Enter Input : instance, and the “manly” Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And
Enter Input : all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other’s
Enter Input : arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as “unfeeling” as before, but he had
Enter Input : become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even
Enter Input : brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a
Enter Input : scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as it
Enter Input : turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.
Enter Input : But of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more
Enter Input : uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must be
Enter Input : noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov’s heart
Enter Input : and, of course, despised him profoundly for his “feelings”; he had in the
Enter Input : past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting
Enter Input : vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the
Enter Input : railway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not
Enter Input : allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more
Enter Input : respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman at
Enter Input : once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the slightest mention of
Enter Input : Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya’s presence, she would flush as pink as a
Enter Input : rose. At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling,
Enter Input : or would investigate the state of his boots, or would shout angrily for
Enter Input : “Perezvon,” the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month
Enter Input : before, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not
Enter Input : showing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully,
Enter Input : teaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him
Enter Input : whenever he was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with
Enter Input : delight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground
Enter Input : pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he had
Enter Input : taught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of his
Enter Input : excited and grateful heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy
Enter Input : stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son
Enter Input : of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when the
Enter Input : schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname “wisp of tow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. Children
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkin
Enter Input : was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school. It had just
Enter Input : struck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out “on very urgent
Enter Input : business,” but he was left alone in charge of the house, for it so
Enter Input : happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and
Enter Input : singular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated from
Enter Input : the rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor’s wife with her two small
Enter Input : children. This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great
Enter Input : friend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve
Enter Input : months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the
Enter Input : last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it not been for her
Enter Input : friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to the
Enter Input : forsaken lady, she would certainly have completely dissolved away in
Enter Input : tears. And now, to add to her misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was
Enter Input : suddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her mistress’s
Enter Input : amazement, that she proposed to bring a child into the world before
Enter Input : morning. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed
Enter Input : the probability of it before. The astounded doctor’s wife decided to move
Enter Input : Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept
Enter Input : by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant,
Enter Input : she promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her.
Enter Input : By the morning all Madame Krassotkin’s friendly sympathy and energy were
Enter Input : called upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the
Enter Input : case.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins’ servant,
Enter Input : Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time to
Enter Input : protect and look after “the kids,” that is, the son and daughter of the
Enter Input : doctor’s wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking care of
Enter Input : the house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without
Enter Input : moving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro
Enter Input : through the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two
Enter Input : loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the
Enter Input : whistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless
Enter Input : dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that
Enter Input : troubled Kolya was “the kids.” He looked, of course, with the utmost scorn
Enter Input : on Katerina’s unexpected adventure, but he was very fond of the bereaved
Enter Input : “kiddies,” and had already taken them a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, a
Enter Input : girl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond
Enter Input : of being read to by her. Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more
Enter Input : diverting entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side by
Enter Input : side and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the
Enter Input : house. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so
Enter Input : much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses
Enter Input : with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like a
Enter Input : trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out
Enter Input : that to play horses with boys of one’s own age, boys of thirteen, would
Enter Input : certainly be disgraceful “at this date,” but that he did it for the sake
Enter Input : of “the kids” because he liked them, and no one had a right to call him to
Enter Input : account for his feelings. The two “kids” adored him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very important
Enter Input : business of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhile
Enter Input : time was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children,
Enter Input : would not come back from market. He had several times already crossed the
Enter Input : passage, opened the door of the lodgers’ room and looked anxiously at “the
Enter Input : kids” who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he
Enter Input : opened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do
Enter Input : something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not go
Enter Input : in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if
Enter Input : that “damned” Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out
Enter Input : without waiting for her, making “the kids” promise, of course, to be brave
Enter Input : when he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright. With this
Enter Input : idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar,
Enter Input : slung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother’s
Enter Input : constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in
Enter Input : such cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall
Enter Input : and went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor
Enter Input : clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with his
Enter Input : tail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya,
Enter Input : seeing his dog’s passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach of
Enter Input : discipline, kept him for another minute under the bench, and only when he
Enter Input : had opened the door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up
Enter Input : like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya opened the door to peep at “the kids.” They were both sitting as
Enter Input : before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something. The
Enter Input : children often argued together about various exciting problems of life,
Enter Input : and Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya did not
Enter Input : agree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his
Enter Input : verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time the “kids’”
Enter Input : discussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage
Enter Input : to listen. The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute
Enter Input : with even greater energy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall never, never believe,” Nastya prattled, “that the old women find
Enter Input : babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It’s winter now and there
Enter Input : are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn’t have taken Katerina a
Enter Input : daughter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya whistled to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who are
Enter Input : married.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nastya, how silly you are!” he said at last, firmly and calmly. “How can
Enter Input : Katerina have a baby when she isn’t married?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastya was exasperated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know nothing about it,” she snapped irritably. “Perhaps she has a
Enter Input : husband, only he is in prison, so now she’s got a baby.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But is her husband in prison?” the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired
Enter Input : gravely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Or, I tell you what,” Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely
Enter Input : rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. “She hasn’t a husband, you
Enter Input : are right there, but she wants to be married, and so she’s been thinking
Enter Input : of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now she’s got it,
Enter Input : that is, not a husband but a baby.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, perhaps so,” Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. “But you didn’t
Enter Input : say so before. So how could I tell?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, kiddies,” said Kolya, stepping into the room. “You’re terrible
Enter Input : people, I see.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And Perezvon with you!” grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingers
Enter Input : and calling Perezvon.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am in a difficulty, kids,” Krassotkin began solemnly, “and you must
Enter Input : help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up till
Enter Input : now, that’s certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showed
Enter Input : signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of
Enter Input : them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t be naughty while I am gone? You won’t climb on the cupboard and
Enter Input : break your legs? You won’t be frightened alone and cry?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A look of profound despondency came into the children’s faces.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon which
Enter Input : can be fired with real gunpowder.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The children’s faces instantly brightened. “Show us the cannon,” said
Enter Input : Kostya, beaming all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronze
Enter Input : cannon stood it on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it’s on wheels.” He rolled the toy
Enter Input : on along the table. “And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded with
Enter Input : shot and fired off.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And it could kill any one?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It can kill any one; you’ve only got to aim at anybody,” and Krassotkin
Enter Input : explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolled
Enter Input : in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kicked
Enter Input : when it was fired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck
Enter Input : their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And have you got any powder?” Nastya inquired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Show us the powder, too,” she drawled with a smile of entreaty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask
Enter Input : containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw of
Enter Input : paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm
Enter Input : of his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One has to be careful there’s no fire about, or it would blow up and kill
Enter Input : us all,” Krassotkin warned them sensationally.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only
Enter Input : intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And does the shot burn?” he inquired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it doesn’t.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me a little shot,” he asked in an imploring voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don’t show it to your
Enter Input : mother till I come back, or she’ll be sure to think it’s gunpowder, and
Enter Input : will die of fright and give you a thrashing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mother never does whip us,” Nastya observed at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don’t you ever deceive
Enter Input : your mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can
Enter Input : I go out? You won’t be frightened and cry when I’m gone?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We sha—all cry,” drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,” Nastya chimed in with timid
Enter Input : haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! There’s no
Enter Input : help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don’t know how
Enter Input : long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!” Kostya begged.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. _Ici_,
Enter Input : Perezvon.” And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his
Enter Input : tricks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of
Enter Input : lilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was
Enter Input : torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on his
Enter Input : back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While this
Enter Input : last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame
Enter Input : Krassotkin’s servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox,
Enter Input : appeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag full
Enter Input : of provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her left
Enter Input : hand she stood still to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious
Enter Input : for her return, he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping
Enter Input : Perezvon dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog
Enter Input : jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only think, a dog!” Agafya observed sententiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you late, female?” asked Krassotkin sternly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brat?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I’m late; if I’m late, you may be sure
Enter Input : I have good reason,” muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove,
Enter Input : without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed quite
Enter Input : pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, you frivolous young woman,” Krassotkin began, getting up from the
Enter Input : sofa, “can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something
Enter Input : else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence?
Enter Input : I am going out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what am I going to swear for?” laughed Agafya. “I shall look after
Enter Input : them without that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan’t go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, don’t then. What does it matter to me? It’s cold out; stay at
Enter Input : home.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Kids,” Kolya turned to the children, “this woman will stay with you till
Enter Input : I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been back
Enter Input : long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You’ll give them something,
Enter Input : Agafya, won’t you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That I can do.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,” he added
Enter Input : gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, “I hope you’ll spare their
Enter Input : tender years and not tell them any of your old woman’s nonsense about
Enter Input : Katerina. _Ici_, Perezvon!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Get along with you!” retorted Agafya, really angry this time. “Ridiculous
Enter Input : boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that’s what you want!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Schoolboy
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at the
Enter Input : gate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying “It is
Enter Input : freezing,” went straight along the street and turned off to the right
Enter Input : towards the market-place. When he reached the last house but one before
Enter Input : the market-place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of his
Enter Input : pocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal. He had
Enter Input : not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven,
Enter Input : wearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This
Enter Input : was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya
Enter Input : Krassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden by
Enter Input : his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a
Enter Input : desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly.
Enter Input : He was—if the reader has not forgotten—one of the group of boys who two
Enter Input : months before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the one who told Alyosha
Enter Input : Karamazov about Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,” said Smurov
Enter Input : stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am late,” answered Krassotkin. “I was detained by circumstances. You
Enter Input : won’t be thrashed for coming with me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, I say, I’m never thrashed! And you’ve got Perezvon with you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re taking him, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s impossible. Zhutchka’s non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mists
Enter Input : of obscurity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! couldn’t we do this?” Smurov suddenly stood still. “You see Ilusha
Enter Input : says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon.
Enter Input : Couldn’t you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Boy, shun a lie, that’s one thing; even with a good object—that’s
Enter Input : another. Above all, I hope you’ve not told them anything about my coming.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won’t comfort him with
Enter Input : Perezvon,” said Smurov, with a sigh. “You know his father, the captain,
Enter Input : ‘the wisp of tow,’ told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff
Enter Input : pup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I
Enter Input : doubt it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how is Ilusha?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he’s in consumption: he is quite
Enter Input : conscious, but his breathing! His breathing’s gone wrong. The other day he
Enter Input : asked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to walk, but
Enter Input : he couldn’t stand. ‘Ah, I told you before, father,’ he said, ‘that those
Enter Input : boots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.’ He fancied it
Enter Input : was his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really.
Enter Input : He won’t live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they are
Enter Input : rich again—they’ve got heaps of money.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are rogues.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who are rogues?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of course,
Enter Input : individually. I don’t believe in medicine. It’s a useless institution. I
Enter Input : mean to go into all that. But what’s that sentimentality you’ve got up
Enter Input : there? The whole class seems to be there every day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not the whole class: it’s only ten of our fellows who go to see him every
Enter Input : day. There’s nothing in that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What I don’t understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is
Enter Input : taking in it. His brother’s going to be tried to-morrow or next day for
Enter Input : such a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with
Enter Input : boys.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make it
Enter Input : up with Ilusha.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one to
Enter Input : analyze my actions.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you are
Enter Input : coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn’t come all this time?” Smurov
Enter Input : cried with sudden warmth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear boy, that’s my business, not yours. I am going of myself because
Enter Input : I choose to, but you’ve all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov—there’s
Enter Input : a difference, you know. And how do you know? I may not be going to make it
Enter Input : up at all. It’s a stupid expression.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not Karamazov at all; it’s not his doing. Our fellows began going
Enter Input : there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And
Enter Input : there’s been nothing of that sort—no silliness. First one went, and then
Enter Input : another. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply
Enter Input : go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha’s dying. And he
Enter Input : seems so glad we’ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that
Enter Input : was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind
Enter Input : or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very
Enter Input : decent man. We made a mistake then. It’s all the fault of that murderer
Enter Input : who beat him then.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karamazov’s a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his
Enter Input : acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.
Enter Input : Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, of
Enter Input : course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a
Enter Input : level with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya’s saying that
Enter Input : he was “going of himself” to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be some
Enter Input : mystery in Kolya’s suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day.
Enter Input : They crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded
Enter Input : wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market women
Enter Input : were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These
Enter Input : Sunday markets were naïvely called “fairs” in the town, and there were
Enter Input : many such fairs in the year.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side,
Enter Input : then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other
Enter Input : over according to the rules of canine etiquette.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,” said Kolya suddenly.
Enter Input : “Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It seems
Enter Input : to be a law of their nature.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; it’s a funny habit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it’s not funny; you are wrong there. There’s nothing funny in nature,
Enter Input : however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs could reason
Enter Input : and criticize us they’d be sure to find just as much that would be funny
Enter Input : to them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, their
Enter Input : masters—far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am convinced that there
Enter Input : is far more foolishness among us. That’s Rakitin’s idea—a remarkable idea.
Enter Input : I am a Socialist, Smurov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what is a Socialist?” asked Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no
Enter Input : marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best, and all
Enter Input : the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet. It’s cold,
Enter Input : though.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don’t feel so
Enter Input : cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do
Enter Input : now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelve
Enter Input : degrees, especially when there is not much snow. It’s because people are
Enter Input : not used to it. Everything is habit with men, everything even in their
Enter Input : social and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What a
Enter Input : funny-looking peasant!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a long
Enter Input : sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together his
Enter Input : hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long fair
Enter Input : beard was all white with frost.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That peasant’s beard’s frozen,” Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice
Enter Input : as he passed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Lots of people’s beards are frozen,” the peasant replied, calmly and
Enter Input : sententiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t provoke him,” observed Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all right; he won’t be cross; he’s a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is your name Matvey?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. Didn’t you know?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t. It was a guess.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You get whipped, I expect?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing to speak of—sometimes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Does it hurt?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, yes, it does.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ech, what a life!” The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his
Enter Input : heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Matvey.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boys went on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That was a nice peasant,” Kolya observed to Smurov. “I like talking to
Enter Input : the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?” asked Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I had to say that to please him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know, Smurov, I don’t like being asked the same thing twice. I like
Enter Input : people to understand at the first word. Some things can’t be explained.
Enter Input : According to a peasant’s notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must be
Enter Input : whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped? And if I were
Enter Input : to tell him we are not, he’d be disappointed. But you don’t understand
Enter Input : that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only don’t tease them, please, or you’ll get into another scrape as you
Enter Input : did about that goose.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you’re afraid?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t laugh, Kolya. Of course I’m afraid. My father would be awfully
Enter Input : cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!” he
Enter Input : shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,” the middle-aged market
Enter Input : woman shouted at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am so glad it’s Marya. Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m in a hurry. I can’t stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.” Kolya
Enter Input : waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent young
Enter Input : monkey. I didn’t say anything,” bawled Marya. “You want a whipping, that’s
Enter Input : what you want, you saucy jackanapes!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her.
Enter Input : Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close
Enter Input : by. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hair
Enter Input : and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and
Enter Input : a peaked cap, and looked like a merchant’s clerk. He was in a state of
Enter Input : stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you!” he cried angrily, “I know you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row with
Enter Input : the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could
Enter Input : hardly remember them all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you?” he asked sarcastically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you! I know you!” the man repeated idiotically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So much the better for you. Well, it’s time I was going. Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are at your saucy pranks again?” cried the man. “You are at your
Enter Input : saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,” said
Enter Input : Kolya, standing still and scanning him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not my business?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No; it’s not your business.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s Trifon Nikititch’s business, not yours.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Trifon Nikititch?” asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement
Enter Input : at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya scanned him gravely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?” he suddenly asked him,
Enter Input : with stern emphasis.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven’t,” said the young man,
Enter Input : somewhat taken aback.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know Sabaneyev?” Kolya went on even more emphatically and even
Enter Input : more severely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Sabaneyev? No, I don’t know him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well then you can go to the devil,” said Kolya, cutting short the
Enter Input : conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his
Enter Input : way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not
Enter Input : even know Sabaneyev.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?” the young man recovered from his momentary
Enter Input : stupefaction and was as excited as before. “What did he say?” He turned to
Enter Input : the market women with a silly stare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The women laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can never tell what he’s after,” said one of them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Sabaneyev is it he’s talking about?” the young man repeated, still
Enter Input : furious and brandishing his right arm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that’s who it must
Enter Input : be,” one of the women suggested.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man stared at her wildly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For the Kuzmitchovs?” repeated another woman. “But his name wasn’t
Enter Input : Trifon. His name’s Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch,
Enter Input : so it can’t be the same.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it’s Tchizhov,” put in suddenly
Enter Input : a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely. “Alexey
Enter Input : Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not a doubt about it, it’s Tchizhov,” a fourth woman emphatically
Enter Input : confirmed the statement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?” he cried
Enter Input : almost in desperation. “ ‘Do you know Sabaneyev?’ says he. And who the
Enter Input : devil’s to know who is Sabaneyev?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’re a senseless fellow. I tell you it’s not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov,
Enter Input : Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that’s who it is!” one of the women shouted at
Enter Input : him impressively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what’s your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can I tell what he’s to do with you?” put in another. “You ought to
Enter Input : know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor about him.
Enter Input : He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Don’t you really know
Enter Input : him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Know whom?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tchizhov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I’ll give him a hiding, that I
Enter Input : will. He was laughing at me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are a
Enter Input : fool, that’s what you are!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. I’ll give
Enter Input : the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along
Enter Input : with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at the
Enter Input : shouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was still
Enter Input : afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya’s company.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Sabaneyev did you mean?” he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his answer
Enter Input : would be.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do I know? Now there’ll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to
Enter Input : stir up fools in every class of society. There’s another blockhead, that
Enter Input : peasant there. You know, they say ‘there’s no one stupider than a stupid
Enter Input : Frenchman,’ but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much. Can’t
Enter Input : you see it all over his face that he is a fool, that peasant, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let him alone, Kolya. Let’s go on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard,
Enter Input : who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed not
Enter Input : quite sober.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,” he said deliberately in
Enter Input : reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And if I am?” laughed Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I don’t mind. There’s no harm in a
Enter Input : joke.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, God forgive you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you forgive me, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I quite forgive you. Go along.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say, you seem a clever peasant.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Cleverer than you,” the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same
Enter Input : gravity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I doubt it,” said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s true, though.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is, brother.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, peasant!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There are all sorts of peasants,” Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief
Enter Input : silence. “How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always ready to
Enter Input : recognize intelligence in the peasantry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The boys made
Enter Input : haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov’s lodging, a
Enter Input : considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces from
Enter Input : the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov
Enter Input : to come out to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One must sniff round a bit first,” he observed to Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why ask him to come out?” Smurov protested. “You go in; they will be
Enter Input : awfully glad to see you. What’s the sense of making friends in the frost
Enter Input : out here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,” Kolya cut him short
Enter Input : in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with “small boys,” and Smurov
Enter Input : ran to do his bidding.

Enter Input : Chapter IV. The Lost Dog
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for Alyosha
Enter Input : to appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had heard a great deal
Enter Input : about him from the boys, but hitherto he had always maintained an
Enter Input : appearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned, and he had
Enter Input : even “criticized” what he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a great
Enter Input : longing to make his acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and
Enter Input : attractive in all he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment was
Enter Input : important: to begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show his
Enter Input : independence, “Or he’ll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy,
Enter Input : like the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I shall ask him
Enter Input : when I get to know him. It’s a pity I am so short, though. Tuzikov is
Enter Input : younger than I am, yet he is half a head taller. But I have a clever face.
Enter Input : I am not good-looking. I know I’m hideous, but I’ve a clever face. I
Enter Input : mustn’t talk too freely; if I fall into his arms all at once, he may
Enter Input : think—Tfoo! how horrible if he should think—!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost to
Enter Input : assume the most independent air. What distressed him most was his being so
Enter Input : short; he did not mind so much his “hideous” face, as being so short. On
Enter Input : the wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark to
Enter Input : show his height, and every two months since he anxiously measured himself
Enter Input : against it to see how much he had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly,
Enter Input : and this sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His face was in reality
Enter Input : by no means “hideous”; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with a
Enter Input : fair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively gray eyes had a fearless
Enter Input : look, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high cheekbones; small,
Enter Input : very red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and unmistakably
Enter Input : turned up. “I’ve a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,” Kolya used to
Enter Input : mutter to himself when he looked in the looking-glass, and he always left
Enter Input : it with indignation. “But perhaps I haven’t got a clever face?” he
Enter Input : sometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But it must not be supposed that
Enter Input : his mind was preoccupied with his face and his height. On the contrary,
Enter Input : however bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him, he
Enter Input : quickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, “abandoning himself
Enter Input : entirely to ideas and to real life,” as he formulated it to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he reached him,
Enter Input : Kolya could see that he looked delighted. “Can he be so glad to see me?”
Enter Input : Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing, that
Enter Input : Alyosha’s appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him
Enter Input : last. He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a
Enter Input : soft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this was very
Enter Input : becoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His charming face always
Enter Input : had a good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in
Enter Input : his good-humor. To Kolya’s surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as he
Enter Input : was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He held out his
Enter Input : hand to Kolya at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here you are at last! How anxious we’ve been to see you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to
Enter Input : make your acquaintance. I’ve long been hoping for an opportunity, and have
Enter Input : heard a great deal about you,” Kolya muttered, a little breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We should have met anyway. I’ve heard a great deal about you, too; but
Enter Input : you’ve been a long time coming here.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me, how are things going?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,” cried
Enter Input : Kolya warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, in
Enter Input : delirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to him
Enter Input : ... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then there’s another
Enter Input : reason.... Tell me, is that your dog?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, Perezvon.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not Zhutchka?” Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. “Is she
Enter Input : lost for ever?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I’ve heard all about it.”
Enter Input : Kolya smiled mysteriously. “Listen, Karamazov, I’ll tell you all about it.
Enter Input : That’s what I came for; that’s what I asked you to come out here for, to
Enter Input : explain the whole episode to you before we go in,” he began with
Enter Input : animation. “You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory class
Enter Input : last spring. Well, you know what our preparatory class is—a lot of small
Enter Input : boys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and,
Enter Input : of course, I only look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weak
Enter Input : and small, but he wouldn’t give in to them; he fought with them. I saw he
Enter Input : was proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that. And
Enter Input : they teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was horribly dressed
Enter Input : at the time, his breeches were too small for him, and there were holes in
Enter Input : his boots. They worried him about it; they jeered at him. That I can’t
Enter Input : stand. I stood up for him at once, and gave it to them hot. I beat them,
Enter Input : but they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?” Kolya boasted impulsively;
Enter Input : “but I am always fond of children. I’ve two chickens in my hands at home
Enter Input : now—that’s what detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I
Enter Input : took him under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that,
Enter Input : the boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he
Enter Input : did my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copy
Enter Input : me. In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once, and
Enter Input : I’d go about with him. On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an older
Enter Input : boy makes friends with a younger one like that; but that’s a prejudice. If
Enter Input : it’s my fancy, that’s enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Why
Enter Input : shouldn’t I develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken up
Enter Input : with all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the younger
Enter Input : generation—to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you this
Enter Input : trait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than
Enter Input : anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was a sort
Enter Input : of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have a
Enter Input : positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from a
Enter Input : baby. There were contradictions in him, too: he was proud, but he was
Enter Input : slavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he’d
Enter Input : refuse to agree with me; he’d argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to
Enter Input : propound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he
Enter Input : disagreed with the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me,
Enter Input : because I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order to
Enter Input : train him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became. I did it on
Enter Input : purpose: that was my idea. My object was to form his character, to lick
Enter Input : him into shape, to make a man of him ... and besides ... no doubt, you
Enter Input : understand me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession
Enter Input : he was downcast and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for
Enter Input : something else, something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was.
Enter Input : I have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late father—it was before his death,
Enter Input : of course—and he taught the little fool a silly trick—that is, a brutal,
Enter Input : nasty trick. He told him to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it,
Enter Input : and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without
Enter Input : biting it, and then to watch and see what would happen. So they prepared a
Enter Input : piece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there’s
Enter Input : been such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never fed
Enter Input : it at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking,
Enter Input : Karamazov? I can’t stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, and
Enter Input : began to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as it
Enter Input : ran out of sight. That was Ilusha’s own account of it. He confessed it to
Enter Input : me, and cried bitterly. He hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on
Enter Input : repeating ‘He ran away squealing’: the sight of that haunted him. He was
Enter Input : tormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined
Enter Input : to give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I wasn’t
Enter Input : quite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than I
Enter Input : was. ‘You’ve done a nasty thing,’ I said, ‘you are a scoundrel. I won’t
Enter Input : tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with you for a
Enter Input : time. I’ll think it over and let you know through Smurov’—that’s the boy
Enter Input : who’s just come with me; he’s always ready to do anything for me—‘whether
Enter Input : I will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up
Enter Input : for good as a scoundrel.’ He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I’d
Enter Input : gone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I
Enter Input : thought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him
Enter Input : that I would not speak to him again. That’s what we call it when two
Enter Input : schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another.
Enter Input : Secretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then, if
Enter Input : I saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him again. That was my
Enter Input : intention. But what do you think happened? He heard Smurov’s message, his
Enter Input : eyes flashed. ‘Tell Krassotkin from me,’ he cried, ‘that I will throw
Enter Input : bread with pins to all the dogs—all—all of them!’ ‘So he’s going in for a
Enter Input : little temper. We must smoke it out of him.’ And I began to treat him with
Enter Input : contempt; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. And
Enter Input : just then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You must
Enter Input : realize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already. The
Enter Input : boys, seeing I’d given him up, set on him and taunted him, shouting, ‘Wisp
Enter Input : of tow, wisp of tow!’ And he had soon regular skirmishes with them, which
Enter Input : I am very sorry for. They seem to have given him one very bad beating. One
Enter Input : day he flew at them all as they were coming out of school. I stood a few
Enter Input : yards off, looking on. And, I swear, I don’t remember that I laughed; it
Enter Input : was quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him, in another minute I
Enter Input : would have run up to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I don’t
Enter Input : know what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and
Enter Input : struck at my thigh, here in my right leg. I didn’t move. I don’t mind
Enter Input : owning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him
Enter Input : contemptuously, as though to say, ‘This is how you repay all my kindness!
Enter Input : Do it again, if you like, I’m at your service.’ But he didn’t stab me
Enter Input : again; he broke down, he was frightened at what he had done, he threw away
Enter Input : the knife, burst out crying, and ran away. I did not sneak on him, of
Enter Input : course, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn’t come to the ears
Enter Input : of the masters. I didn’t even tell my mother till it had healed up. And
Enter Input : the wound was a mere scratch. And then I heard that the same day he’d been
Enter Input : throwing stones and had bitten your finger—but you understand now what a
Enter Input : state he was in! Well, it can’t be helped: it was stupid of me not to come
Enter Input : and forgive him—that is, to make it up with him—when he was taken ill. I
Enter Input : am sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now I’ve told you all
Enter Input : about it ... but I’m afraid it was stupid of me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, what a pity,” exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, “that I didn’t know
Enter Input : before what terms you were on with him, or I’d have come to you long ago
Enter Input : to beg you to go to him with me. Would you believe it, when he was
Enter Input : feverish he talked about you in delirium. I didn’t know how much you were
Enter Input : to him! And you’ve really not succeeded in finding that dog? His father
Enter Input : and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it. Would you believe
Enter Input : it, since he’s been ill, I’ve three times heard him repeat with tears,
Enter Input : ‘It’s because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God is
Enter Input : punishing me for it.’ He can’t get that idea out of his head. And if the
Enter Input : dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy the joy
Enter Input : would cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him?” Kolya
Enter Input : asked, with great curiosity. “Why did you reckon on me rather than any one
Enter Input : else?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you would
Enter Input : bring it when you’d found it. Smurov said something of the sort. We’ve all
Enter Input : been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that it’s been seen.
Enter Input : The boys brought him a live hare; he just looked at it, with a faint
Enter Input : smile, and asked them to set it free in the fields. And so we did. His
Enter Input : father has just this moment come back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hoping
Enter Input : to comfort him with that; but I think it only makes it worse.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him, but what
Enter Input : do you make of him—a mountebank, a buffoon?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed.
Enter Input : Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom they
Enter Input : daren’t speak the truth, from having been for years humiliated and
Enter Input : intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery is
Enter Input : sometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is centered in Ilusha,
Enter Input : and if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with grief or kill himself. I
Enter Input : feel almost certain of that when I look at him now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,” Kolya
Enter Input : added, with feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you were
Enter Input : bringing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is
Enter Input : Perezvon. I’ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more
Enter Input : than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in a
Enter Input : minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!” Kolya cried suddenly. “You’ve
Enter Input : no overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we
Enter Input : are all egoists, Karamazov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t trouble; it is cold, but I don’t often catch cold. Let us go in,
Enter Input : though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called Kolya,
Enter Input : but what else?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nikolay—Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in official
Enter Input : documents, ‘Krassotkin son.’ ” Kolya laughed for some reason, but added
Enter Input : suddenly, “Of course I hate my name Nikolay.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s so trivial, so ordinary.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are thirteen?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, fourteen—that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight. I’ll
Enter Input : confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since it’s our first
Enter Input : meeting, so that you may understand my character at once. I hate being
Enter Input : asked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... there’s a libelous story
Enter Input : going about me, that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys.
Enter Input : It’s a fact that I did play with them, but it’s a perfect libel to say I
Enter Input : did it for my own amusement. I have reasons for believing that you’ve
Enter Input : heard the story; but I wasn’t playing for my own amusement, it was for the
Enter Input : sake of the children, because they couldn’t think of anything to do by
Enter Input : themselves. But they’ve always got some silly tale. This is an awful town
Enter Input : for gossip, I can tell you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what’s the
Enter Input : harm?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don’t play horses, do you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you must look at it like this,” said Alyosha, smiling. “Grown-up
Enter Input : people go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes
Enter Input : are represented—sometimes there are robbers and battles, too—and isn’t
Enter Input : that just the same thing, in a different form, of course? And young
Enter Input : people’s games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in
Enter Input : its first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic instincts
Enter Input : of the young. And sometimes these games are much better than performances
Enter Input : in the theater, the only difference is that people go there to look at the
Enter Input : actors, while in these games the young people are the actors themselves.
Enter Input : But that’s only natural.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You think so? Is that your idea?” Kolya looked at him intently. “Oh, you
Enter Input : know, that’s rather an interesting view. When I go home, I’ll think it
Enter Input : over. I’ll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I’ve come to
Enter Input : learn of you, Karamazov,” Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneous
Enter Input : feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I of you,” said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that he
Enter Input : treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he
Enter Input : were “quite grown up.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll show you something directly, Karamazov; it’s a theatrical
Enter Input : performance, too,” he said, laughing nervously. “That’s why I’ve come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys
Enter Input : leave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I’m only coming in for a minute. I’ll keep on my overcoat. Perezvon
Enter Input : will stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon, lie down and
Enter Input : be dead! You see how he’s dead. I’ll go in first and explore, then I’ll
Enter Input : whistle to him when I think fit, and you’ll see, he’ll dash in like mad.
Enter Input : Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment. I’ll arrange
Enter Input : it all and you’ll see something.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. By Ilusha’s Bedside
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is
Enter Input : already familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment
Enter Input : with a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and
Enter Input : though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha
Enter Input : who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the
Enter Input : fact. All the art he had used had been to take them, one by one, to
Enter Input : Ilusha, without “sheepish sentimentality,” appearing to do so casually and
Enter Input : without design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. He
Enter Input : was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy
Enter Input : shown him by these boys, who had been his enemies. Krassotkin was the only
Enter Input : one missing and his absence was a heavy load on Ilusha’s heart. Perhaps
Enter Input : the bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing Krassotkin, who
Enter Input : had been his one friend and protector. Clever little Smurov, who was the
Enter Input : first to make it up with Ilusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted
Enter Input : to Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something, the
Enter Input : latter cut him short, bidding Smurov tell “Karamazov” at once that he knew
Enter Input : best what to do, that he wanted no one’s advice, and that, if he went to
Enter Input : see Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he had “his own reasons.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha had not been
Enter Input : to see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited, he sent Smurov to
Enter Input : him twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt, impatient
Enter Input : refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any more, that if he
Enter Input : came himself, he, Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha at all. Up to the
Enter Input : very last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that
Enter Input : morning, and only the evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolya
Enter Input : abruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning, for he would go
Enter Input : with him to the Snegiryovs’, but warned him on no account to say he was
Enter Input : coming, as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov’s fancy
Enter Input : that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya had
Enter Input : dropped that “they must be asses not to find the dog, if it was alive.”
Enter Input : When Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly hinted at his guess about
Enter Input : the dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent rage. “I’m not such an ass as to
Enter Input : go hunting about the town for other people’s dogs when I’ve got a dog of
Enter Input : my own! And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a
Enter Input : pin? Sheepish sentimentality, that’s what it is!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikons
Enter Input : in the corner. He had not been to school since the day he met Alyosha and
Enter Input : bit his finger. He was taken ill the same day, though for a month
Enter Input : afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and
Enter Input : passage. But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without
Enter Input : help from his father. His father was terribly concerned about him. He even
Enter Input : gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die.
Enter Input : And often, especially after leading him round the room on his arm and
Enter Input : putting him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the passage and,
Enter Input : leaning his head against the wall, he would break into paroxysms of
Enter Input : violent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Returning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to amuse and
Enter Input : comfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories, funny anecdotes, or
Enter Input : would mimic comic people he had happened to meet, even imitate the howls
Enter Input : and cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear to see his father fooling
Enter Input : and playing the buffoon. Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked
Enter Input : it, he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt,
Enter Input : and he was continually haunted by the memory of the “wisp of tow” and that
Enter Input : “terrible day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nina, Ilusha’s gentle, crippled sister, did not like her father’s
Enter Input : buffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg
Enter Input : to study at the university). But the half-imbecile mother was greatly
Enter Input : diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or
Enter Input : performing something. It was the only way she could be amused; all the
Enter Input : rest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now every one had
Enter Input : forgotten her, that no one treated her with respect, that she was
Enter Input : slighted, and so on. But during the last few days she had completely
Enter Input : changed. She began looking constantly at Ilusha’s bed in the corner and
Enter Input : seemed lost in thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried,
Enter Input : she cried quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change in
Enter Input : her with mournful perplexity. The boys’ visits at first only angered her,
Enter Input : but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her, and at
Enter Input : last she liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming, she
Enter Input : would have felt dreary without them. When the children told some story or
Enter Input : played a game, she laughed and clapped her hands. She called some of them
Enter Input : to her and kissed them. She was particularly fond of Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who came to
Enter Input : cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy. He
Enter Input : even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression, and that that
Enter Input : would hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about Ilusha, he had not,
Enter Input : till lately, felt one minute’s doubt of his boy’s ultimate recovery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot; he
Enter Input : was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back,
Enter Input : but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up. He began buying
Enter Input : little things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and cut them
Enter Input : sandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money. He
Enter Input : had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha
Enter Input : had predicted he would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more
Enter Input : about their circumstances and Ilusha’s illness, visited them herself, made
Enter Input : the acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the
Enter Input : half-imbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping them, and
Enter Input : the captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying,
Enter Input : forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : came punctually every other day, but little was gained by his visits and
Enter Input : he dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday morning a new doctor
Enter Input : was expected, who had come from Moscow, where he had a great reputation.
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense, not
Enter Input : expressly for Ilusha, but for another object of which more will be said in
Enter Input : its place hereafter. But, as he had come, she had asked him to see Ilusha
Enter Input : as well, and the captain had been told to expect him. He hadn’t the
Enter Input : slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wished
Enter Input : for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room, the
Enter Input : captain and all the boys were round Ilusha’s bed, looking at a tiny
Enter Input : mastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the captain
Enter Input : had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was still
Enter Input : fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard
Enter Input : three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy, not an
Enter Input : ordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff (a very important point, of
Enter Input : course), tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased.
Enter Input : But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only
Enter Input : served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had
Enter Input : killed. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling sadly,
Enter Input : stroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked the puppy,
Enter Input : but ... it wasn’t Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy,
Enter Input : too, then he would have been completely happy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Krassotkin!” cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first to see him
Enter Input : come in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Krassotkin’s entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away and
Enter Input : stood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full view of Ilusha.
Enter Input : The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Please come in ... you are welcome!” he said hurriedly. “Ilusha, Mr.
Enter Input : Krassotkin has come to see you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly showed his
Enter Input : complete knowledge of the manners of good society. He turned first to the
Enter Input : captain’s wife sitting in her arm-chair, who was very ill-humored at the
Enter Input : moment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha’s bed
Enter Input : and did not let her see the new puppy. With the greatest courtesy he made
Enter Input : her a bow, scraping his foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as the
Enter Input : only other lady present, a similar bow. This polite behavior made an
Enter Input : extremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There, you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought
Enter Input : up,” she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; “but as for our other
Enter Input : visitors they come in one on the top of another.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that?” muttered
Enter Input : the captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her account.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s how they ride in. They get on each other’s shoulders in the
Enter Input : passage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange sort of
Enter Input : visitors!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But who’s come in like that, mamma?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, that boy came in riding on that one’s back and this one on that
Enter Input : one’s.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya was already by Ilusha’s bedside. The sick boy turned visibly paler.
Enter Input : He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya. Kolya had not
Enter Input : seen his little friend for two months, and he was overwhelmed at the sight
Enter Input : of him. He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted, yellow
Enter Input : face, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands.
Enter Input : He saw, with grieved surprise, Ilusha’s rapid, hard breathing and dry
Enter Input : lips. He stepped close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed,
Enter Input : he said:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, old man ... how are you?” But his voice failed him, he couldn’t
Enter Input : achieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched and the corners
Enter Input : of his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile, still unable
Enter Input : to utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it over
Enter Input : Ilusha’s hair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind!” he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or perhaps not
Enter Input : knowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hallo, so you’ve got a new puppy?” Kolya said suddenly, in a most callous
Enter Input : voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ye—es,” answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A black nose, that means he’ll be fierce, a good house-dog,” Kolya
Enter Input : observed gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared about was the
Enter Input : puppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had to do his utmost to
Enter Input : control his feelings not to burst out crying like a child, and do what he
Enter Input : would he could not control it. “When it grows up, you’ll have to keep it
Enter Input : on the chain, I’m sure.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’ll be a huge dog!” cried one of the boys.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course he will,” “a mastiff,” “large,” “like this,” “as big as a
Enter Input : calf,” shouted several voices.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As big as a calf, as a real calf,” chimed in the captain. “I got one like
Enter Input : that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents are huge and
Enter Input : very fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor.... Sit down here,
Enter Input : on Ilusha’s bed, or here on the bench. You are welcome, we’ve been hoping
Enter Input : to see you a long time.... You were so kind as to come with Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha’s feet. Though he had
Enter Input : perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way,
Enter Input : now he completely lost the thread of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No ... I came with Perezvon. I’ve got a dog now, called Perezvon. A
Enter Input : Slavonic name. He’s out there ... if I whistle, he’ll run in. I’ve brought
Enter Input : a dog, too,” he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. “Do you remember
Enter Input : Zhutchka, old man?” he suddenly fired the question at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilusha’s little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression at
Enter Input : Kolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not to
Enter Input : speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where ... is Zhutchka?” Ilusha asked in a broken voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka’s lost and done for!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya.
Enter Input : Alyosha, catching Kolya’s eye, signed to him vigorously again, but he
Enter Input : turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a meal
Enter Input : like that,” Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a little
Enter Input : breathless. “But I’ve got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I’ve
Enter Input : brought him to show you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want him!” said Ilusha suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him on
Enter Input : purpose.... He’s the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to call in
Enter Input : my dog, madam?” He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable
Enter Input : excitement in his manner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want him, I don’t want him!” cried Ilusha, with a mournful break
Enter Input : in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better,” the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which
Enter Input : he had just sat down, “you’d better ... another time,” he muttered, but
Enter Input : Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to Smurov, “Open the
Enter Input : door,” and as soon as it was open, he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed
Enter Input : headlong into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!” shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stood
Enter Input : erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha’s bedside. What followed was a surprise
Enter Input : to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent over
Enter Input : Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s ... Zhutchka!” he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy and
Enter Input : suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And who did you think it was?” Krassotkin shouted with all his might, in
Enter Input : a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him
Enter Input : up to Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn, just
Enter Input : the marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I found him
Enter Input : directly. He did not belong to any one!” he explained, turning quickly to
Enter Input : the captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha. “He used to
Enter Input : live in the Fedotovs’ back-yard. Though he made his home there, they did
Enter Input : not feed him. He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I
Enter Input : found him.... You see, old man, he couldn’t have swallowed what you gave
Enter Input : him. If he had, he must have died, he must have! So he must have spat it
Enter Input : out, since he is alive. You did not see him do it. But the pin pricked his
Enter Input : tongue, that is why he squealed. He ran away squealing and you thought
Enter Input : he’d swallowed it. He might well squeal, because the skin of dogs’ mouths
Enter Input : is so tender ... tenderer than in men, much tenderer!” Kolya cried
Enter Input : impetuously, his face glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could not
Enter Input : speak. White as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his great
Enter Input : eyes almost starting out of his head. And if Krassotkin, who had no
Enter Input : suspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a
Enter Input : moment might have on the sick child’s health, nothing would have induced
Enter Input : him to play such a trick on him. But Alyosha was perhaps the only person
Enter Input : in the room who realized it. As for the captain he behaved like a small
Enter Input : child.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Zhutchka! It’s Zhutchka!” he cried in a blissful voice, “Ilusha, this is
Enter Input : Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!” He was almost weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I never guessed!” cried Smurov regretfully. “Bravo, Krassotkin! I
Enter Input : said he’d find the dog and here he’s found him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here he’s found him!” another boy repeated gleefully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Krassotkin’s a brick!” cried a third voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s a brick, he’s a brick!” cried the other boys, and they began
Enter Input : clapping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait, wait,” Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. “I’ll
Enter Input : tell you how it happened, that’s the whole point. I found him, I took him
Enter Input : home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not show
Enter Input : him to any one till to-day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight,
Enter Input : but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess. And
Enter Input : meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all
Enter Input : the things he can do! I trained him so as to bring you a well-trained dog,
Enter Input : in good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, ‘See, old man,
Enter Input : what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!’ Haven’t you a bit of meat? He’ll
Enter Input : show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat,
Enter Input : haven’t you got any?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking
Enter Input : was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted to
Enter Input : Perezvon, “Dead!” And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back
Enter Input : with its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with the
Enter Input : same suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dog’s
Enter Input : performance was “mamma.” She laughed at the dog and began snapping her
Enter Input : fingers and calling it, “Perezvon, Perezvon!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing will make him get up, nothing!” Kolya cried triumphantly, proud
Enter Input : of his success. “He won’t move for all the shouting in the world, but if I
Enter Input : call to him, he’ll jump up in a minute. Ici, Perezvon!” The dog leapt up
Enter Input : and bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran back with a piece
Enter Input : of cooked beef.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it hot?” Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air, taking
Enter Input : the meat. “Dogs don’t like hot things. No, it’s all right. Look,
Enter Input : everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren’t you looking? He does
Enter Input : not look at him, now I’ve brought him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose
Enter Input : out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The luckless
Enter Input : dog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as long as his
Enter Input : master chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for half an hour.
Enter Input : But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Paid for!” cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog’s
Enter Input : nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and
Enter Input : surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the
Enter Input : dog?” exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his
Enter Input : voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Simply for that!” answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. “I wanted to
Enter Input : show him in all his glory.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perezvon! Perezvon,” called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingers
Enter Input : and beckoning to the dog.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!” Kolya slapped
Enter Input : the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both arms round
Enter Input : his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek. Ilusha crept close to
Enter Input : him, stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog’s shaggy
Enter Input : coat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dear, dear!” kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again on the
Enter Input : edge of the bed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I’ve brought you a little cannon.
Enter Input : You remember, I told you about it before and you said how much you’d like
Enter Input : to see it. Well, here, I’ve brought it to you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon. He
Enter Input : hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have waited
Enter Input : till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he hurried on
Enter Input : regardless of all consideration. “You are all happy now,” he felt, “so
Enter Input : here’s something to make you happier!” He was perfectly enchanted himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been coveting this thing for a long while; it’s for you, old man,
Enter Input : it’s for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he had it from
Enter Input : his brother. I swopped a book from father’s book-case for it, _A Kinsman
Enter Input : of Mahomet or Salutary Folly_, a scandalous book published in Moscow a
Enter Input : hundred years ago, before they had any censorship. And Morozov has a taste
Enter Input : for such things. He was grateful to me, too....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it.
Enter Input : Ilusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round the dog, he
Enter Input : gazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even greater when Kolya
Enter Input : announced that he had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off at
Enter Input : once “if it won’t alarm the ladies.” “Mamma” immediately asked to look at
Enter Input : the toy closer and her request was granted. She was much pleased with the
Enter Input : little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap.
Enter Input : She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea
Enter Input : of what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot. The
Enter Input : captain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minute
Enter Input : quantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be put off till another
Enter Input : time. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an empty part of the
Enter Input : room, three grains of powder were thrust into the touch-hole and a match
Enter Input : was put to it. A magnificent explosion followed. Mamma was startled, but
Enter Input : at once laughed with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. But
Enter Input : the captain, looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them. Kolya
Enter Input : picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together with
Enter Input : the powder and the shot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I got it for you, for you! I’ve been keeping it for you a long time,” he
Enter Input : repeated once more in his delight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!” mamma began begging like a
Enter Input : little child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it.
Enter Input : Kolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, mamma,” he ran to her, “the cannon’s yours, of course, but let
Enter Input : Ilusha have it, because it’s a present to him, but it’s just as good as
Enter Input : yours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both of
Enter Input : you, both of you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine
Enter Input : altogether, not Ilusha’s,” persisted mamma, on the point of tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Take it, mother, here, keep it!” Ilusha cried. “Krassotkin, may I give it
Enter Input : to my mother?” he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as though
Enter Input : he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to some one
Enter Input : else.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course you may,” Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the cannon
Enter Input : from Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow. She was so
Enter Input : touched that she cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha, darling, he’s the one who loves his mamma!” she said tenderly,
Enter Input : and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, let me kiss your hand.” The captain darted up to her at once and
Enter Input : did so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,” said the
Enter Input : grateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I’ll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the powder
Enter Input : ourselves now. Borovikov found out how it’s made—twenty-four parts of
Enter Input : saltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal. It’s all pounded
Enter Input : together, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy
Enter Input : sieve—that’s how it’s done.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it’s not real
Enter Input : gunpowder,” responded Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not real?” Kolya flushed. “It burns. I don’t know, of course.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t mean that,” put in the captain with a guilty face. “I only
Enter Input : said that real powder is not made like that, but that’s nothing, it can be
Enter Input : made so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it burned
Enter Input : splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash. But that was only
Enter Input : the paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best, I
Enter Input : don’t know.... And Bulkin’s father thrashed him on account of our powder,
Enter Input : did you hear?” he turned to Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense interest and
Enter Input : enjoyment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his
Enter Input : bed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and thrashed him on the
Enter Input : spot. He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters. He is
Enter Input : not allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go about with me
Enter Input : now. Smurov is not allowed to either, I’ve got a bad name with every one.
Enter Input : They say I’m a ‘desperate character,’ ” Kolya smiled scornfully. “It all
Enter Input : began from what happened on the railway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, we’ve heard of that exploit of yours, too,” cried the captain. “How
Enter Input : could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren’t the least
Enter Input : afraid, lying there under the train? Weren’t you frightened?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “N—not particularly,” answered Kolya carelessly. “What’s blasted my
Enter Input : reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,” he said,
Enter Input : turning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an unconcerned air as he
Enter Input : talked, he still could not control himself and was continually missing the
Enter Input : note he tried to keep up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! I heard about the goose!” Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. “They
Enter Input : told me, but I didn’t understand. Did they really take you to the court?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill as
Enter Input : they always do,” Kolya began carelessly. “I was walking through the
Enter Input : market-place here one day, just when they’d driven in the geese. I stopped
Enter Input : and looked at them. All at once a fellow, who is an errand-boy at
Enter Input : Plotnikov’s now, looked at me and said, ‘What are you looking at the geese
Enter Input : for?’ I looked at him; he was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am
Enter Input : always on the side of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to the
Enter Input : peasants.... We’ve dropped behind the peasants—that’s an axiom. I believe
Enter Input : you are laughing, Karamazov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,” said Alyosha with a most good-natured
Enter Input : air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,” he hurried on again, looking
Enter Input : pleased. “I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their
Enter Input : due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a _sine qua non_ ... But I
Enter Input : was telling you about the goose. So I turned to the fool and answered, ‘I
Enter Input : am wondering what the goose thinks about.’ He looked at me quite stupidly,
Enter Input : ‘And what does the goose think about?’ he asked. ‘Do you see that cart
Enter Input : full of oats?’ I said. ‘The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the
Enter Input : goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up—do you
Enter Input : see?’ ‘I see that quite well,’ he said. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘if that cart were
Enter Input : to move on a little, would it break the goose’s neck or not?’ ‘It’d be
Enter Input : sure to break it,’ and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted.
Enter Input : ‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said. And it did not
Enter Input : take us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed, and
Enter Input : I stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasn’t looking, he
Enter Input : was talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its head
Enter Input : in after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I
Enter Input : winked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose’s neck
Enter Input : was broken in half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at
Enter Input : that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. ‘You did that on
Enter Input : purpose!’ ‘No, not on purpose.’ ‘Yes, you did, on purpose!’ Well, they
Enter Input : shouted, ‘Take him to the justice of the peace!’ They took me, too. ‘You
Enter Input : were there, too,’ they said, ‘you helped, you’re known all over the
Enter Input : market!’ And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,”
Enter Input : Kolya added conceitedly. “We all went off to the justice’s, they brought
Enter Input : the goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubbering
Enter Input : like a woman. And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number
Enter Input : of geese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses. The justice of
Enter Input : the peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a rouble
Enter Input : for the goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was warned not to
Enter Input : play such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. ‘It
Enter Input : wasn’t me,’ he said, ‘it was he egged me on,’ and he pointed to me. I
Enter Input : answered with the utmost composure that I hadn’t egged him on, that I
Enter Input : simply stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically. The
Enter Input : justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for having
Enter Input : smiled. ‘I’ll complain to your masters of you, so that for the future you
Enter Input : mayn’t waste your time on such general propositions, instead of sitting at
Enter Input : your books and learning your lessons.’ He didn’t complain to the masters,
Enter Input : that was a joke, but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears of
Enter Input : the masters. Their ears are long, you know! The classical master,
Enter Input : Kolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off
Enter Input : again. But Kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass. Did
Enter Input : you know, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles,
Enter Input : and his bride’s a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.
Enter Input : The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Astounding news has reached the class,
Enter Input :     Kolbasnikov has been an ass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so on, awfully funny, I’ll bring it to you later on. I say nothing
Enter Input : against Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there’s no doubt about it. I
Enter Input : respect men like that and it’s not because he stood up for me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you took him down about the founders of Troy!” Smurov put in
Enter Input : suddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He was
Enter Input : particularly pleased with the story of the goose.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you really take him down?” the captain inquired, in a flattering way.
Enter Input : “On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me about it
Enter Input : at the time.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!” put in
Enter Input : Ilusha; “he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top in every
Enter Input : subject....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, that’s all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this an
Enter Input : unimportant question,” said Kolya with haughty humility. He had by now
Enter Input : completely recovered his dignity, though he was still a little uneasy. He
Enter Input : felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose,
Enter Input : for instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious
Enter Input : and had not said a word all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees to
Enter Input : have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, and
Enter Input : thought he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything like
Enter Input : that Kolya would—
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I regard the question as quite a trivial one,” he rapped out again,
Enter Input : proudly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I know who founded Troy,” a boy, who had not spoken before, said
Enter Input : suddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent and seemed to be
Enter Input : shy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He was sitting
Enter Input : near the door. Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret
Enter Input : for the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by reading
Enter Input : Smaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when Kolya’s back
Enter Input : was turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolya’s
Enter Input : books, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation
Enter Input : of Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could not bring
Enter Input : himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy, afraid
Enter Input : of what might happen and of Krassotkin’s somehow putting him to shame over
Enter Input : it. But now he couldn’t resist saying it. For weeks he had been longing
Enter Input : to.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, who did found it?” asked Kolya, turning to him with haughty
Enter Input : superciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and at once
Enter Input : made up his mind how to take it. There was, so to speak, a discordant note
Enter Input : in the general harmony.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,” the boy rapped out
Enter Input : at once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so, that it was
Enter Input : painful to look at him. But the boys stared at him, stared at him for a
Enter Input : whole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were
Enter Input : fastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy with
Enter Input : disdainful composure.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In what sense did they found it?” he deigned to comment at last. “And
Enter Input : what is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do? Did they go
Enter Input : and each lay a brick, do you suppose?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson. He was
Enter Input : silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so for a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a
Enter Input : nationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,” he admonished
Enter Input : him in stern, incisive tones. “But I attach no consequence to these old
Enter Input : wives’ tales and I don’t think much of universal history in general,” he
Enter Input : added carelessly, addressing the company generally.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Universal history?” the captain inquired, looking almost scared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, universal history! It’s the study of the successive follies of
Enter Input : mankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are mathematics and
Enter Input : natural science,” said Kolya. He was showing off and he stole a glance at
Enter Input : Alyosha; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there. But Alyosha was
Enter Input : still silent and still serious as before. If Alyosha had said a word it
Enter Input : would have stopped him, but Alyosha was silent and “it might be the
Enter Input : silence of contempt,” and that finally irritated Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing more.
Enter Input : You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t agree,” said Alyosha, with a faint smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a police
Enter Input : measure, that’s simply why it has been introduced into our schools.” By
Enter Input : degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. “Latin and Greek were
Enter Input : introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect.
Enter Input : It was dull before, so what could they do to make things duller? It was
Enter Input : senseless enough before, so what could they do to make it more senseless?
Enter Input : So they thought of Greek and Latin. That’s my opinion, I hope I shall
Enter Input : never change it,” Kolya finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true,” assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of conviction.
Enter Input : He had listened attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And yet he is first in Latin himself,” cried one of the group of boys
Enter Input : suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin,” echoed Ilusha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What of it?” Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise was
Enter Input : very sweet to him. “I am fagging away at Latin because I have to, because
Enter Input : I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that whatever you
Enter Input : do, it’s worth doing it well. But in my soul I have a profound contempt
Enter Input : for the classics and all that fraud.... You don’t agree, Karamazov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why ‘fraud’?” Alyosha smiled again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all languages,
Enter Input : so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin,
Enter Input : but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the intelligence. So what can
Enter Input : one call it but a fraud?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, who taught you all this?” cried Alyosha, surprised at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being
Enter Input : taught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics being translated
Enter Input : our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The doctor has come!” cried Nina, who had been silent till then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate. The captain,
Enter Input : who had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed headlong out to
Enter Input : meet him. “Mamma” pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.
Enter Input : Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight. Nina,
Enter Input : from her invalid chair, anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. The
Enter Input : boys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to come again in the
Enter Input : evening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t go away, I won’t go away,” Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. “I’ll
Enter Input : wait in the passage and come back when the doctor’s gone, I’ll come back
Enter Input : with Perezvon.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person with long,
Enter Input : dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat. As he
Enter Input : crossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback; he probably fancied he had
Enter Input : come to the wrong place. “How is this? Where am I?” he muttered, not
Enter Input : removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of
Enter Input : the room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. The
Enter Input : captain, bent double, was bowing low before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s here, sir, here, sir,” he muttered cringingly; “it’s here, you’ve
Enter Input : come right, you were coming to us...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sne-gi-ryov?” the doctor said loudly and pompously. “Mr. Snegiryov—is
Enter Input : that you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s me, sir!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw
Enter Input : off his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck. The
Enter Input : captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took off his cap.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where is the patient?” he asked emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. Precocity
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you think the doctor will say to him?” Kolya asked quickly. “What
Enter Input : a repulsive mug, though, hasn’t he? I can’t endure medicine!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha is dying. I think that’s certain,” answered Alyosha, mournfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are rogues! Medicine’s a fraud! I am glad to have made your
Enter Input : acquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time. I
Enter Input : am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more
Enter Input : demonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this, smiled, and
Enter Input : pressed his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve long learned to respect you as a rare person,” Kolya muttered again,
Enter Input : faltering and uncertain. “I have heard you are a mystic and have been in
Enter Input : the monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasn’t put me off.
Enter Input : Contact with real life will cure you.... It’s always so with characters
Enter Input : like yours.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?” Alyosha was rather
Enter Input : astonished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, God and all the rest of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, don’t you believe in God?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I’ve nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but
Enter Input : ... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all
Enter Input : that ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented,”
Enter Input : added Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might
Enter Input : think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was
Enter Input : “grown up.” “I haven’t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to
Enter Input : him,” Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly
Enter Input : annoyed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must confess I can’t endure entering on such discussions,” he said with
Enter Input : a final air. “It’s possible for one who doesn’t believe in God to love
Enter Input : mankind, don’t you think so? Voltaire didn’t believe in God and loved
Enter Input : mankind?” (“I am at it again,” he thought to himself.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don’t
Enter Input : think he loved mankind very much either,” said Alyosha quietly, gently,
Enter Input : and quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age,
Enter Input : or even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha’s apparent
Enter Input : diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the
Enter Input : question for him, little Kolya, to settle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you read Voltaire?” Alyosha finished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not to say read.... But I’ve read _Candide_ in the Russian
Enter Input : translation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again!
Enter Input : again!)”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did you understand it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn’t
Enter Input : understand it? There’s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I
Enter Input : can understand that it’s a philosophical novel and written to advocate an
Enter Input : idea....” Kolya was getting mixed by now. “I am a Socialist, Karamazov, I
Enter Input : am an incurable Socialist,” he announced suddenly, apropos of nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A Socialist?” laughed Alyosha. “But when have you had time to become one?
Enter Input : Why, I thought you were only thirteen?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya winced.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in a
Enter Input : fortnight,” he flushed angrily, “and in the second place I am at a
Enter Input : complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The question is
Enter Input : what are my convictions, not what is my age, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When you are older, you’ll understand for yourself the influence of age
Enter Input : on convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your own
Enter Input : ideas,” Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya interrupted him
Enter Input : hotly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the Christian
Enter Input : religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and the powerful
Enter Input : to keep the lower classes in slavery. That’s so, isn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!”
Enter Input : cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me so. I
Enter Input : can think for myself.... I am not opposed to Christ, if you like. He was a
Enter Input : most humane person, and if He were alive to-day, He would be found in the
Enter Input : ranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a conspicuous part....
Enter Input : There’s no doubt about that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made friends
Enter Input : with?” exclaimed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked to
Enter Input : Mr. Rakitin, of course, but ... old Byelinsky said that, too, so they
Enter Input : say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Byelinsky? I don’t remember. He hasn’t written that anywhere.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If he didn’t write it, they say he said it. I heard that from a ... but
Enter Input : never mind.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And have you read Byelinsky?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, no ... I haven’t read all of him, but ... I read the passage about
Enter Input : Tatyana, why she didn’t go off with Onyegin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Didn’t go off with Onyegin? Surely you don’t ... understand that
Enter Input : already?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov,” said Kolya, with a grin of
Enter Input : irritation. “But please don’t suppose I am such a revolutionist. I often
Enter Input : disagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at all for
Enter Input : the emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a subject race and
Enter Input : must obey. _Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.” Kolya, for some
Enter Input : reason, smiled, “And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with
Enter Input : that pseudo-great man. I think, too, that to leave one’s own country and
Enter Input : fly to America is mean, worse than mean—silly. Why go to America when one
Enter Input : may be of great service to humanity here? Now especially. There’s a
Enter Input : perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us. That’s what I answered.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going to
Enter Input : America already?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must own, they’ve been at me to go, but I declined. That’s between
Enter Input : ourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one. I say
Enter Input : this only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the
Enter Input : secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     _Long will you remember_
Enter Input :     _The house at the Chain bridge._
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Do you remember? It’s splendid. Why are you laughing? You don’t suppose I
Enter Input : am fibbing, do you?” (“What if he should find out that I’ve only that one
Enter Input : number of _The Bell_ in father’s bookcase, and haven’t read any more of
Enter Input : it?” Kolya thought with a shudder.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, I am not laughing and don’t suppose for a moment that you are
Enter Input : lying. No, indeed, I can’t suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly
Enter Input : true. But tell me, have you read Pushkin—_Onyegin_, for instance?... You
Enter Input : spoke just now of Tatyana.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I haven’t read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no prejudices,
Enter Input : Karamazov; I want to hear both sides. What makes you ask?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, nothing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?” Kolya rapped out
Enter Input : suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he were on drill.
Enter Input : “Be so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have a contempt for you?” Alyosha looked at him wondering. “What for? I
Enter Input : am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by
Enter Input : all this crude nonsense before you have begun life.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be anxious about my nature,” Kolya interrupted, not without
Enter Input : complacency. “But it’s true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely
Enter Input : sensitive. You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, my smile meant something quite different. I’ll tell you why I smiled.
Enter Input : Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in
Enter Input : Russia, on our students and schoolboys of to-day. ‘Show a Russian
Enter Input : schoolboy,’ he writes, ‘a map of the stars, which he knows nothing about,
Enter Input : and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.’ No
Enter Input : knowledge and unbounded conceit—that’s what the German meant to say about
Enter Input : the Russian schoolboy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that’s perfectly right,” Kolya laughed suddenly, “exactly so! Bravo
Enter Input : the German! But he did not see the good side, what do you think? Conceit
Enter Input : may be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, on
Enter Input : the other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood,
Enter Input : boldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these sausage
Enter Input : makers, groveling before authority.... But the German was right all the
Enter Input : same. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same. Though
Enter Input : they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Strangled, what for?” smiled Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childish
Enter Input : sometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can’t restrain myself
Enter Input : and am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are chattering away here
Enter Input : about nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there. But perhaps
Enter Input : he’s examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked that Nina,
Enter Input : you know. She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away, ‘Why didn’t
Enter Input : you come before?’ And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she is
Enter Input : awfully nice and pathetic.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes! Well, you’ll be coming often, you will see what she is like. It
Enter Input : would do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn to
Enter Input : value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,”
Enter Input : Alyosha observed warmly. “That would have more effect on you than
Enter Input : anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!” Kolya
Enter Input : exclaimed, with bitter feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it’s a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child
Enter Input : was to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept me
Enter Input : from coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly
Enter Input : wilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I’ve been struggling
Enter Input : with it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways,
Enter Input : Karamazov!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, you have a charming nature, though it’s been distorted, and I quite
Enter Input : understand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidly
Enter Input : sensitive boy,” Alyosha answered warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you say that to me!” cried Kolya; “and would you believe it, I
Enter Input : thought—I’ve thought several times since I’ve been here—that you despised
Enter Input : me! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it, just
Enter Input : now, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, that
Enter Input : you must be very sensitive!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You thought so? What an eye you’ve got, I say! I bet that was when I was
Enter Input : talking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you had a great
Enter Input : contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for a moment I
Enter Input : quite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool. Then I fancied—just
Enter Input : now, here—when I said that if there were no God He would have to be
Enter Input : invented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge,
Enter Input : especially as I got that phrase out of a book. But I swear I wasn’t
Enter Input : showing off out of vanity, though I really don’t know why. Because I was
Enter Input : so pleased? Yes, I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it’s
Enter Input : perfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing directly they are pleased,
Enter Input : I know that. But I am convinced now that you don’t despise me; it was all
Enter Input : my imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. I sometimes fancy
Enter Input : all sorts of things, that every one is laughing at me, the whole world,
Enter Input : and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you worry every one about you,” smiled Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tell
Enter Input : me, am I very ridiculous now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t think about that, don’t think of it at all!” cried Alyosha. “And
Enter Input : what does ridiculous mean? Isn’t every one constantly being or seeming
Enter Input : ridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of
Enter Input : being ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at is
Enter Input : that you should be feeling that so early, though I’ve observed it for some
Enter Input : time past, and not only in you. Nowadays the very children have begun to
Enter Input : suffer from it. It’s almost a sort of insanity. The devil has taken the
Enter Input : form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; it’s simply the
Enter Input : devil,” added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that Kolya, staring at
Enter Input : him, expected to see. “You are like every one else,” said Alyosha, in
Enter Input : conclusion, “that is, like very many others. Only you must not be like
Enter Input : everybody else, that’s all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Even if every one is like that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, even if every one is like that. You be the only one not like it. You
Enter Input : really are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to confess to
Enter Input : something bad and even ridiculous. And who will admit so much in these
Enter Input : days? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to
Enter Input : self-criticism. Don’t be like every one else, even if you are the only
Enter Input : one.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one. Oh, how
Enter Input : I have longed to know you, Karamazov! I’ve long been eager for this
Enter Input : meeting. Can you really have thought about me, too? You said just now that
Enter Input : you thought of me, too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I’d heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if it’s partly
Enter Input : vanity that makes you ask, it doesn’t matter.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,”
Enter Input : said Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice. “That’s not ridiculous, is
Enter Input : it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn’t matter, because it’s
Enter Input : been a good thing.” Alyosha smiled brightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed
Enter Input : yourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.” Kolya smiled with a sort of sly
Enter Input : happiness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why ashamed?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, why are you blushing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was you made me blush,” laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. “Oh,
Enter Input : well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don’t know...” he muttered,
Enter Input : almost embarrassed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are
Enter Input : rather ashamed! Because you are just like me,” cried Kolya, in positive
Enter Input : ecstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,” something made
Enter Input : Alyosha say suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!” Kolya agreed at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you will bless life on the whole, all the same.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together,
Enter Input : Karamazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quite
Enter Input : like an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But
Enter Input : we shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, I’ve been saying to
Enter Input : myself, ‘Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part
Enter Input : enemies to the grave!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And saying that, of course, you loved me,” Alyosha laughed gayly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did. I loved you awfully. I’ve been loving and dreaming of you. And how
Enter Input : do you know it all beforehand? Ah, here’s the doctor. Goodness! What will
Enter Input : he tell us? Look at his face!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. Ilusha
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The doctor came out of the room again, muffled in his fur coat and with
Enter Input : his cap on his head. His face looked almost angry and disgusted, as though
Enter Input : he were afraid of getting dirty. He cast a cursory glance round the
Enter Input : passage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so. Alyosha waved
Enter Input : from the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought the
Enter Input : doctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and, bowing
Enter Input : apologetically, stopped him to get the last word. The poor fellow looked
Enter Input : utterly crushed; there was a scared look in his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?” he began, but could
Enter Input : not go on and clasped his hands in despair. Yet he still gazed imploringly
Enter Input : at the doctor, as though a word from him might still change the poor boy’s
Enter Input : fate.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t help it, I am not God!” the doctor answered offhand, though with
Enter Input : the customary impressiveness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You must be prepared for anything,” said the doctor in emphatic and
Enter Input : incisive tones, and dropping his eyes, he was about to step out to the
Enter Input : coach.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your Excellency, for Christ’s sake!” the terror-stricken captain stopped
Enter Input : him again. “Your Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely nothing save him
Enter Input : now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not in my hands now,” said the doctor impatiently, “but h’m!...” he
Enter Input : stopped suddenly. “If you could, for instance ... send ... your patient
Enter Input : ... at once, without delay” (the words “at once, without delay,” the
Enter Input : doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain
Enter Input : start) “to Syracuse, the change to the new be-ne-ficial climatic
Enter Input : conditions might possibly effect—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Syracuse!” cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Syracuse is in Sicily,” Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation. The
Enter Input : doctor looked at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sicily! your Excellency,” faltered the captain, “but you’ve seen”—he
Enter Input : spread out his hands, indicating his surroundings—“mamma and my family?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “N—no, Sicily is not the place for the family, the family should go to
Enter Input : Caucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus,
Enter Input : and your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her
Enter Input : rheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist
Enter Input : Lepelletier; I could give you a note to him, and then ... there might be a
Enter Input : change—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Doctor, doctor! But you see!” The captain flung wide his hands again
Enter Input : despairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that’s not my business,” grinned the doctor. “I have only told you
Enter Input : the answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment.
Enter Input : As for the rest, to my regret—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be afraid, apothecary, my dog won’t bite you,” Kolya rapped out
Enter Input : loudly, noticing the doctor’s rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who was
Enter Input : standing in the doorway. There was a wrathful note in Kolya’s voice. He
Enter Input : used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he
Enter Input : explained afterwards, used it “to insult him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s that?” The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise at
Enter Input : Kolya. “Who’s this?” he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him to
Enter Input : explain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s Perezvon’s master, don’t worry about me,” Kolya said incisively
Enter Input : again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perezvon?”(7) repeated the doctor, perplexed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good-by, we shall meet
Enter Input : in Syracuse.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who’s this? Who’s this?” The doctor flew into a terrible rage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice of
Enter Input : him,” said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. “Kolya, hold your
Enter Input : tongue!” he cried to Krassotkin. “Take no notice of him, doctor,” he
Enter Input : repeated, rather impatiently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!” The doctor stamped in a perfect
Enter Input : fury.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!” said Kolya, turning
Enter Input : pale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. “_Ici_, Perezvon!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Kolya, if you say another word, I’ll have nothing more to do with you,”
Enter Input : Alyosha cried peremptorily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay
Enter Input : Krassotkin—this is the man”; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. “I obey him,
Enter Input : good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room.
Enter Input : Perezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds in
Enter Input : amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out quickly to
Enter Input : the carriage, repeating aloud, “This is ... this is ... I don’t know what
Enter Input : it is!” The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage. Alyosha
Enter Input : followed Kolya into the room. He was already by Ilusha’s bedside. The sick
Enter Input : boy was holding his hand and calling for his father. A minute later the
Enter Input : captain, too, came back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, father, come ... we ...” Ilusha faltered in violent excitement,
Enter Input : but apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms round his father
Enter Input : and Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as tightly as he
Enter Input : could. The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs, and Kolya’s
Enter Input : lips and chin twitched.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, father! How sorry I am for you!” Ilusha moaned bitterly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we
Enter Input : shall be happy ... the doctor ...” the captain began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me.... I saw!”
Enter Input : cried Ilusha, and again he hugged them both with all his strength, hiding
Enter Input : his face on his father’s shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, don’t cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ... choose
Enter Input : one of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha and love him instead of
Enter Input : me....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush, old man, you’ll get well,” Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice
Enter Input : that sounded angry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But don’t ever forget me, father,” Ilusha went on, “come to my grave ...
Enter Input : and, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walk,
Enter Input : and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... I
Enter Input : shall expect you.... Father, father!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was
Enter Input : crying quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying, “mamma,”
Enter Input : too, burst into tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha! Ilusha!” she exclaimed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha’s embrace.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,” he said quickly.
Enter Input : “What a pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious.... But
Enter Input : after dinner I’ll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole
Enter Input : evening, and I’ll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things. And
Enter Input : I’ll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me, because he will
Enter Input : begin to howl when I am away and bother you. Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he ran out into the passage. He didn’t want to cry, but in the passage
Enter Input : he burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will be
Enter Input : terribly disappointed,” Alyosha said emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before!” muttered
Enter Input : Kolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed the
Enter Input : door behind him. His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling. He
Enter Input : stood before the two and flung up his arms.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want a good boy! I don’t want another boy!” he muttered in a wild
Enter Input : whisper, clenching his teeth. “If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my
Enter Input : tongue—” He broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the wooden
Enter Input : bench. Pressing his fists against his head, he began sobbing with absurd
Enter Input : whimpering cries, doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in
Enter Input : the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya ran out into the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself?” he cried sharply and angrily
Enter Input : to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will certainly come in the evening.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What was that he said about Jerusalem?... What did he mean by that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s from the Bible. ‘If I forget thee, Jerusalem,’ that is, if I forget
Enter Input : all that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its place, then
Enter Input : may—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand, that’s enough! Mind you come! _Ici_, Perezvon!” he cried
Enter Input : with positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went home.

Enter Input : Book XI. Ivan
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. At Grushenka’s
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov’s house to
Enter Input : see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an
Enter Input : urgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned
Enter Input : that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day.
Enter Input : During the two months that had passed since Mitya’s arrest, Alyosha had
Enter Input : called frequently at the widow Morozov’s house, both from his own
Enter Input : inclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya’s
Enter Input : arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.
Enter Input : For one whole week she was unconscious. She was very much changed—thinner
Enter Input : and a little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been well
Enter Input : enough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than
Enter Input : before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her. A look of
Enter Input : firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face. There were
Enter Input : signs of a spiritual transformation in her, and a steadfast, fine and
Enter Input : humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her.
Enter Input : There was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming
Enter Input : face a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance.
Enter Input : There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that had
Enter Input : overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a
Enter Input : terrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of her
Enter Input : illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka
Enter Input : had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in the
Enter Input : once proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire
Enter Input : when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her
Enter Input : heart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever—Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium.
Enter Input : Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : had not once visited Mitya in his prison, though she might have done it
Enter Input : whenever she liked. All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he
Enter Input : was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she
Enter Input : was continually asking advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Full of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had returned
Enter Input : from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement with
Enter Input : which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been
Enter Input : expecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game of
Enter Input : “fools” lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on
Enter Input : the other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it. He wore a
Enter Input : dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak,
Enter Input : though he was smiling blissfully. When the homeless old man returned with
Enter Input : Grushenka from Mokroe two months before, he had simply stayed on and was
Enter Input : still staying with her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down on
Enter Input : the sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid,
Enter Input : appealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the first
Enter Input : stage of fever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first
Enter Input : half-hour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently:
Enter Input : he laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She called Fenya and told her
Enter Input : to give him something to eat. All that day he sat in the same place,
Enter Input : almost without stirring. When it got dark and the shutters were closed,
Enter Input : Fenya asked her mistress:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; make him a bed on the sofa,” answered Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had
Enter Input : literally nowhere to go, and that “Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me
Enter Input : straight that he wouldn’t receive me again and gave me five roubles.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, God bless you, you’d better stay, then,” Grushenka decided in her
Enter Input : grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man’s heart
Enter Input : and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer
Enter Input : had stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when she
Enter Input : was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but
Enter Input : went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had
Enter Input : grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun
Enter Input : to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and
Enter Input : begin talking to “Maximushka” about trifling matters, to keep her from
Enter Input : thinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story-teller
Enter Input : on occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka saw
Enter Input : scarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never
Enter Input : stayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, “at his last
Enter Input : gasp” as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after
Enter Input : Mitya’s trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching,
Enter Input : he made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last
Enter Input : and bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict orders
Enter Input : to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, “The
Enter Input : master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.”
Enter Input : But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve come at last!” she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully
Enter Input : greeting Alyosha, “and Maximushka’s been scaring me that perhaps you
Enter Input : wouldn’t come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you
Enter Input : have—coffee?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, please,” said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. “I am very
Enter Input : hungry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,” cried Grushenka. “It’s been made a
Enter Input : long time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they are
Enter Input : hot. Do you know, we’ve had a storm over those pies to-day. I took them to
Enter Input : the prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: he
Enter Input : would not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it.
Enter Input : So I said to him: ‘I shall leave them with the warder; if you don’t eat
Enter Input : them before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for
Enter Input : you!’ With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it?
Enter Input : Whenever I go we quarrel.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feeling
Enter Input : nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did you quarrel about this time?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I didn’t expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole.
Enter Input : ‘Why are you keeping him?’ he said. ‘So you’ve begun keeping him.’ He is
Enter Input : jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping! He even
Enter Input : took it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he knew about the Pole before?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning, but
Enter Input : to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed to
Enter Input : repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps
Enter Input : Rakitin is egging him on. What do you think?” she added carelessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He loves you, that’s what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is
Enter Input : particularly worried.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I went to him
Enter Input : to say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think what’s going to
Enter Input : happen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And he
Enter Input : talks about the Pole! He’s too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet,
Enter Input : anyway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,” Maximov put in his word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Jealous of you?” Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. “Of whom could
Enter Input : she have been jealous?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of the servant girls.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry.
Enter Input : Don’t ogle the pies. I shan’t give you any; they are not good for you, and
Enter Input : I won’t give you any vodka either. I have to look after him, too, just as
Enter Input : though I kept an almshouse,” she laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,” said Maximov,
Enter Input : with tears in his voice. “You would do better to spend your kindness on
Enter Input : people of more use than me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who’s of most
Enter Input : use? If only that Pole didn’t exist, Alyosha. He’s taken it into his head
Enter Input : to fall ill, too, to-day. I’ve been to see him also. And I shall send him
Enter Input : some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn’t sent him any, but Mitya accused me of
Enter Input : it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here’s Fenya with a letter! Yes, it’s
Enter Input : from the Poles—begging again!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically
Enter Input : eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the
Enter Input : letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it
Enter Input : within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had
Enter Input : received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former
Enter Input : lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two
Enter Input : Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first
Enter Input : letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper
Enter Input : and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical
Enter Input : that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head
Enter Input : or tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was
Enter Input : followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a
Enter Input : loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that
Enter Input : letter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed—one every
Enter Input : day—all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually
Enter Input : diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten,
Enter Input : and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her
Enter Input : for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round
Enter Input : herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost
Enter Input : destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their
Enter Input : landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at
Enter Input : Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting
Enter Input : her with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio
Enter Input : and pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former
Enter Input : admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not
Enter Input : in the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to
Enter Input : Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had
Enter Input : always sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into his
Enter Input : head to be fearfully jealous.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see
Enter Input : Mitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,” Grushenka began again with nervous
Enter Input : haste. “I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. ‘Fancy,’ I said, ‘my Pole
Enter Input : had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar. He
Enter Input : thought I would be touched and marry him!’ Mitya leapt up swearing.... So,
Enter Input : there, I’ll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they’ve
Enter Input : sent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and
Enter Input : tell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did
Enter Input : send them the pies.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I wouldn’t tell him for anything,” said Alyosha, smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he’s jealous on purpose. He
Enter Input : doesn’t care,” said Grushenka bitterly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On purpose?” queried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all
Enter Input : your cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me. I
Enter Input : would be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am not
Enter Input : offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous myself.
Enter Input : Only what offends me is that he doesn’t love me at all. I tell you he is
Enter Input : jealous now _on purpose_. Am I blind? Don’t I see? He began talking to me
Enter Input : just now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this and that, how she
Enter Input : had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she had
Enter Input : ordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves her, if
Enter Input : he’ll praise her to my face, more shame to him! He’s treated me badly
Enter Input : himself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throw
Enter Input : it all on me. ‘You were with your Pole before me, so I can’t be blamed for
Enter Input : Katerina,’ that’s what it amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame on
Enter Input : me. He attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I’ll—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes in
Enter Input : her handkerchief and sobbed violently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He doesn’t love Katerina Ivanovna,” said Alyosha firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, whether he loves her or not, I’ll soon find out for myself,” said
Enter Input : Grushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief from
Enter Input : her eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being
Enter Input : mild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Enough of this foolishness,” she said suddenly; “it’s not for that I sent
Enter Input : for you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrow—what will happen to-morrow? That’s
Enter Input : what worries me! And it’s only me it worries! I look at every one and no
Enter Input : one is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you thinking about it
Enter Input : even? To-morrow he’ll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried?
Enter Input : You know it’s the valet, the valet killed him! Good heavens! Can they
Enter Input : condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him? They
Enter Input : haven’t troubled the valet at all, have they?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s been severely cross-examined,” observed Alyosha thoughtfully; “but
Enter Input : every one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying very ill.
Enter Input : He has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,” added Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, dear! couldn’t you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole
Enter Input : thing by yourself? He’s been brought from Petersburg for three thousand
Enter Input : roubles, they say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We gave these three thousand together—Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and I—but
Enter Input : she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counsel
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known all
Enter Input : over Russia; it’s talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitch
Enter Input : agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has
Enter Input : become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well? Did you talk to him?” Grushenka put in eagerly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his
Enter Input : opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They’ll ruin him. And why did she
Enter Input : send for the doctor?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya’s mad and committed the
Enter Input : murder when he didn’t know what he was doing”; Alyosha smiled gently; “but
Enter Input : Mitya won’t agree to that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!” cried Grushenka.
Enter Input : “He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am!
Enter Input : But, of course, he didn’t do it, he didn’t do it! And they are all against
Enter Input : him, the whole town. Even Fenya’s evidence went to prove he had done it.
Enter Input : And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too,
Enter Input : before, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, all
Enter Input : crying out against him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, there’s a fearful accumulation of evidence,” Alyosha observed
Enter Input : grimly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And Grigory—Grigory Vassilyevitch—sticks to his story that the door was
Enter Input : open, persists that he saw it—there’s no shaking him. I went and talked to
Enter Input : him myself. He’s rude about it, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that’s perhaps the strongest evidence against him,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And as for Mitya’s being mad, he certainly seems like it now,” Grushenka
Enter Input : began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. “Do you know, Alyosha,
Enter Input : I’ve been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time. I go to him
Enter Input : every day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose he’s
Enter Input : always talking about? He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I
Enter Input : fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I couldn’t
Enter Input : understand in my foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a
Enter Input : babe—that is, about some child. ‘Why is the babe poor?’ he said. ‘It’s for
Enter Input : that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to
Enter Input : Siberia!’ What that meant, what babe, I couldn’t tell for the life of me.
Enter Input : Only I cried when he said it, because he said it so nicely. He cried
Enter Input : himself, and I cried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the
Enter Input : cross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be Rakitin, who’s been going to see him lately,” smiled Alyosha,
Enter Input : “though ... that’s not Rakitin’s doing. I didn’t see Mitya yesterday. I’ll
Enter Input : see him to-day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it’s not Rakitin; it’s his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him.
Enter Input : It’s his going to see him, that’s what it is,” Grushenka began, and
Enter Input : suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan’s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan
Enter Input : hasn’t been once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurring things out!” exclaimed
Enter Input : Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. “Stay, Alyosha, hush! Since
Enter Input : I’ve said so much I’ll tell the whole truth—he’s been to see him twice,
Enter Input : the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of
Enter Input : course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He
Enter Input : told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to
Enter Input : tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently
Enter Input : impressed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan doesn’t talk to me of Mitya’s case,” he said slowly. “He’s said very
Enter Input : little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems
Enter Input : vexed at my coming, so I’ve not been to him for the last three weeks.
Enter Input : H’m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change
Enter Input : in Mitya this week.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There has been a change,” Grushenka assented quickly. “They have a
Enter Input : secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and
Enter Input : such a secret that Mitya can’t rest. Before then, he was cheerful—and,
Enter Input : indeed, he is cheerful now—but when he shakes his head like that, you
Enter Input : know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his
Enter Input : right temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind
Enter Input : worrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is
Enter Input : cheerful to-day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you said he was worried.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a
Enter Input : minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha,
Enter Input : I am constantly wondering at him—with this awful thing hanging over him,
Enter Input : he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, ‘Don’t
Enter Input : tell him’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he told me, ‘Don’t tell him.’ It’s you that Mitya’s most afraid of.
Enter Input : Because it’s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling,
Enter Input : go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,”
Enter Input : Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. “Set my mind at rest that I
Enter Input : may know the worst that’s in store for me. That’s why I sent for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You think it’s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn’t have
Enter Input : told you there was a secret.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn’t dare to. He warns
Enter Input : me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won’t tell me what it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you think yourself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do I think? It’s the end for me, that’s what I think. They all three
Enter Input : have been plotting my end, for Katerina’s in it. It’s all Katerina, it all
Enter Input : comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He
Enter Input : tells me that beforehand—warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that’s
Enter Input : the whole secret. They’ve planned it together, the three of them—Mitya,
Enter Input : Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I’ve been wanting to ask you a
Enter Input : long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with
Enter Input : Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or
Enter Input : not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I
Enter Input : think.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, that’s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that’s
Enter Input : what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on
Enter Input : me afterwards. He is stupid, he can’t disguise what he is doing; he is so
Enter Input : open, you know.... But I’ll give it to him, I’ll give it to him! ‘You
Enter Input : believe I did it,’ he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me
Enter Input : with that! God forgive him! You wait, I’ll make it hot for Katerina at the
Enter Input : trial! I’ll just say a word then ... I’ll tell everything then!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again she cried bitterly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,” Alyosha said, getting up.
Enter Input : “First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and
Enter Input : you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don’t
Enter Input : want to worm his secret out of him, but if he’ll tell me of himself
Enter Input : to-day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you.
Enter Input : Then I’ll come to you to-day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something
Enter Input : else. That’s certain. It isn’t likely it’s about Katerina Ivanovna, it
Enter Input : seems to me. Good-by for now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that she
Enter Input : put little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had her
Enter Input : sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her in such a
Enter Input : state of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many things to do
Enter Input : still.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. The Injured Foot
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and he
Enter Input : hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late
Enter Input : for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three
Enter Input : weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she was not in
Enter Input : bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in a
Enter Input : fascinating but decorous _déshabillé_. Alyosha had once noted with
Enter Input : innocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov had
Enter Input : begun to be rather dressy—top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made
Enter Input : their appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed
Enter Input : such ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the
Enter Input : young official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight to
Enter Input : Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to him
Enter Input : the previous day, specially asking him to come to her “about something
Enter Input : very important,” a request which, for certain reasons, had interest for
Enter Input : Alyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise, Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and immediately sent to beg
Enter Input : him to come to her “just for one minute.” Alyosha reflected that it was
Enter Input : better to accede to the mamma’s request, or else she would be sending down
Enter Input : to Lise’s room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lying
Enter Input : on a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a
Enter Input : state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries of
Enter Input : rapture.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s ages, ages, perfect ages since I’ve seen you! It’s a whole week—only
Enter Input : think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday. You
Enter Input : have come to see Lise. I’m sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe,
Enter Input : without my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only
Enter Input : knew how worried I am about her! But of that later, though that’s the most
Enter Input : important thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you
Enter Input : implicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima—God rest his
Enter Input : soul!” (she crossed herself)—“I look upon you as a monk, though you look
Enter Input : charming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in these
Enter Input : parts? No, no, that’s not the chief thing—of that later. Forgive me for
Enter Input : sometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,”
Enter Input : she smiled coquettishly; “but that will do later, too. The important thing
Enter Input : is that I shouldn’t forget what is important. Please remind me of it
Enter Input : yourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say ‘the
Enter Input : important thing?’ Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever
Enter Input : since Lise took back her promise—her childish promise, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch—to marry you, you’ve realized, of course, that it was only
Enter Input : the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her
Enter Input : chair—thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from
Enter Input : Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow—But why speak of
Enter Input : to-morrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to
Enter Input : die of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I
Enter Input : paid him fifty roubles for the visit. But that’s not the point, that’s not
Enter Input : the point again. You see, I’m mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry.
Enter Input : Why am I in a hurry? I don’t understand. It’s awful how I seem growing
Enter Input : unable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of
Enter Input : tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and
Enter Input : that will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here and
Enter Input : no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just had
Enter Input : coffee.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At Agrafena Alexandrovna’s.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At ... at that woman’s? Ah, it’s she has brought ruin on every one. I
Enter Input : know nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though it’s
Enter Input : rather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What use is it
Enter Input : now? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you
Enter Input : that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall
Enter Input : certainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my
Enter Input : chair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, I
Enter Input : am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don’t know what I
Enter Input : shall say. One has to take an oath, hasn’t one?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; but I don’t think you will be able to go.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, and
Enter Input : then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all this
Enter Input : so quickly, so quickly, everything’s changing, and at last—nothing. All
Enter Input : grow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary.
Enter Input : This Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has disappointed all my hopes. Now
Enter Input : she is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia, and your other
Enter Input : brother is going to follow her, and will live in the nearest town, and
Enter Input : they will all torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of
Enter Input : all—the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the
Enter Input : papers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there’s a
Enter Input : paragraph that I was ‘a dear friend’ of your brother’s ——, I can’t repeat
Enter Input : the horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here, in
Enter Input : the Petersburg paper _Gossip_. The paper began coming out this year. I am
Enter Input : awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me out—this is
Enter Input : what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her
Enter Input : pillow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps
Enter Input : everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The paragraph was
Enter Input : very typical, and must have been a great shock to her, but, fortunately
Enter Input : perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that
Enter Input : moment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite
Enter Input : forget the newspaper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all
Enter Input : over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother, about
Enter Input : the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of those two
Enter Input : months, among other equally credible items! One paper had even stated that
Enter Input : he had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his brother’s
Enter Input : crime. Another contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, Father
Enter Input : Zossima, had broken into the monastery chest and “made tracks from the
Enter Input : monastery.” The present paragraph in the paper _Gossip_ was under the
Enter Input : heading, “The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.” (That, alas! was the
Enter Input : name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief,
Enter Input : and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it. No names appeared,
Enter Input : in fact. It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trial
Enter Input : was making such a sensation—retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and
Enter Input : reactionary bully—was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and
Enter Input : particularly popular with certain ladies “who were pining in solitude.”
Enter Input : One such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a
Enter Input : grown-up daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the
Enter Input : crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he would
Enter Input : elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on escaping
Enter Input : punishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousand
Enter Input : rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his pining
Enter Input : lady. This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst of
Enter Input : generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately
Enter Input : abolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha
Enter Input : folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that must be me,” she hurried on again. “Of course I am meant.
Enter Input : Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and here
Enter Input : they talk of ‘middle-aged charms’ as though that were my motive! He writes
Enter Input : that out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as
Enter Input : I forgive him! You know it’s— Do you know who it is? It’s your friend
Enter Input : Rakitin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps,” said Alyosha, “though I’ve heard nothing about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s he, it’s he! No ‘perhaps’ about it. You know I turned him out of the
Enter Input : house.... You know all that story, don’t you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why it
Enter Input : was, I haven’t heard ... from you, at least.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, then you’ve heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me
Enter Input : dreadfully?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you’ve given him up I
Enter Input : haven’t heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed. We are
Enter Input : not friends.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, then, I’ll tell you all about it. There’s no help for it, I’ll
Enter Input : confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a
Enter Input : little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn’t count. You see, my
Enter Input : dear boy”—Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, though
Enter Input : enigmatic, smile played about her lips—“you see, I suspect ... You must
Enter Input : forgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite the
Enter Input : contrary. I speak to you now as though you were my father—mother’s quite
Enter Input : out of place. Well, it’s as though I were confessing to Father Zossima,
Enter Input : that’s just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man,
Enter Input : your friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can’t be angry with him. I feel
Enter Input : cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe it,
Enter Input : seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I only
Enter Input : noticed it later. At first—a month ago—he only began to come oftener to
Enter Input : see me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before. I
Enter Input : knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to
Enter Input : notice things with surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest,
Enter Input : charming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who’s in the
Enter Input : service here, began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him here
Enter Input : ever so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man,
Enter Input : isn’t he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I should
Enter Input : be glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I
Enter Input : love young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost
Enter Input : the mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,
Enter Input : certainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On that
Enter Input : awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And your
Enter Input : friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on the
Enter Input : carpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as he
Enter Input : was going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swell
Enter Input : directly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here
Enter Input : before, and would you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at
Enter Input : him, for some reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and
Enter Input : laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone—no, I was laid up then.
Enter Input : Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only
Enter Input : fancy! brought me some verses of his own composition—a short poem, on my
Enter Input : bad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minute—how did
Enter Input : it go?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     A captivating little foot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I’ve got it here.
Enter Input : I’ll show it to you later. But it’s a charming thing—charming; and, you
Enter Input : know, it’s not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too, a charming
Enter Input : idea, only I’ve forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing for an album.
Enter Input : So, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently flattered. I’d hardly
Enter Input : had time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly
Enter Input : looked as black as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way,
Enter Input : for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses.
Enter Input : I had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr
Enter Input : Ilyitch the verses and didn’t say who was the author. But I am convinced
Enter Input : that he guessed, though he won’t own it to this day, and declares he had
Enter Input : no idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at
Enter Input : once, and fell to criticizing it. ‘Wretched doggerel,’ he said they were,
Enter Input : ‘some divinity student must have written them,’ and with such vehemence,
Enter Input : such vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage.
Enter Input : ‘Good gracious!’ I thought, ‘they’ll fly at each other.’ ‘It was I who
Enter Input : wrote them,’ said he. ‘I wrote them as a joke,’ he said, ‘for I think it
Enter Input : degrading to write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a
Enter Input : monument to your Pushkin for writing about women’s feet, while I wrote
Enter Input : with a moral purpose, and you,’ said he, ‘are an advocate of serfdom.
Enter Input : You’ve no humane ideas,’ said he. ‘You have no modern enlightened
Enter Input : feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,’ he
Enter Input : said, ‘and you take bribes.’ Then I began screaming and imploring them.
Enter Input : And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took up
Enter Input : the most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and
Enter Input : apologized. ‘I’d no idea,’ said he. ‘I shouldn’t have said it, if I had
Enter Input : known. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,’ he said. In
Enter Input : short, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He
Enter Input : explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in
Enter Input : earnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, ‘Would
Enter Input : it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for
Enter Input : shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?’ And, would you believe it, I
Enter Input : lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not.
Enter Input : I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldn’t
Enter Input : make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be
Enter Input : telling me, ‘Speak,’ and the other ‘No, don’t speak.’ And no sooner had
Enter Input : the second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there
Enter Input : was a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, ‘It’s painful for me to
Enter Input : say it, but I don’t wish to see you in my house again.’ So I turned him
Enter Input : out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it
Enter Input : on. I wasn’t angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied—that
Enter Input : was what did it—that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believe
Enter Input : me, it was quite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for several
Enter Input : days afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it.
Enter Input : So it’s a fortnight since he’s been here, and I kept wondering whether he
Enter Input : would come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night came
Enter Input : this _Gossip_. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must
Enter Input : have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,
Enter Input : and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it’s
Enter Input : awful how I keep talking and don’t say what I want to say. Ah! the words
Enter Input : come of themselves!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,”
Enter Input : Alyosha faltered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is an
Enter Input : aberration?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What aberration?” asked Alyosha, wondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.
Enter Input : Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming creature,
Enter Input : only I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She was with me
Enter Input : some time ago and I couldn’t get anything out of her. Especially as she
Enter Input : won’t talk to me except on the surface now. She is always talking about my
Enter Input : health and nothing else, and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I
Enter Input : simply said to myself, ‘Well, so be it. I don’t care’... Oh, yes. I was
Enter Input : talking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come?
Enter Input : Of course, you know it—the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him.
Enter Input : No, it wasn’t you, but Katya. It’s all Katya’s doing. Well, you see, a man
Enter Input : may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may be
Enter Input : conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration.
Enter Input : And there’s no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from
Enter Input : aberration. They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were
Enter Input : reformed. It’s all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor
Enter Input : has been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.
Enter Input : ‘How did he seem then?’ he asked me. He must have been in a state of
Enter Input : aberration. He came in shouting, ‘Money, money, three thousand! Give me
Enter Input : three thousand!’ and then went away and immediately did the murder. ‘I
Enter Input : don’t want to murder him,’ he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him.
Enter Input : That’s why they’ll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet he
Enter Input : murdered him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he didn’t murder him,” Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He felt
Enter Input : more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Grigory?” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down,
Enter Input : and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why, why?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he
Enter Input : went and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn’t, he very likely
Enter Input : doesn’t remember. Only, you know, it’ll be better, ever so much better, if
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that’s how it must have been, though
Enter Input : I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that’s
Enter Input : better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed
Enter Input : his father, I don’t defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,
Enter Input : and yet it would be better if it were he, as you’d have nothing to cry
Enter Input : over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was
Enter Input : conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit him—that’s
Enter Input : so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew
Enter Input : nothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time. And when I
Enter Input : heard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at
Enter Input : once. And if he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts
Enter Input : to dinner with me, and I’ll have a party of friends, and we’ll drink to
Enter Input : the reformed law courts. I don’t believe he’d be dangerous; besides, I’ll
Enter Input : invite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did
Enter Input : anything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in
Enter Input : another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best
Enter Input : judges. And, besides, who isn’t suffering from aberration nowadays?—you,
Enter Input : I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so many
Enter Input : examples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him,
Enter Input : he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one
Enter Input : blames him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The
Enter Input : doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my Lise is in a
Enter Input : state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday, and the day before,
Enter Input : too, and to-day I suddenly realized that it’s all due to aberration. Oh,
Enter Input : Lise grieves me so! I believe she’s quite mad. Why did she send for you?
Enter Input : Did she send for you or did you come of yourself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.” Alyosha got up
Enter Input : resolutely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that’s what’s most
Enter Input : important,” Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. “God
Enter Input : knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it’s no matter her
Enter Input : sending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me, I
Enter Input : can’t trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : though I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only fancy,
Enter Input : he’s been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How? What? When?” Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat down
Enter Input : again and listened standing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will tell you; that’s perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don’t know
Enter Input : now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me
Enter Input : twice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a friend to
Enter Input : call on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came because he
Enter Input : heard she was here. I didn’t, of course, expect him to come often, knowing
Enter Input : what a lot he has to do as it is, _vous comprenez, cette affaire et la
Enter Input : mort terrible de votre papa_. But I suddenly heard he’d been here again,
Enter Input : not to see me but to see Lise. That’s six days ago now. He came, stayed
Enter Input : five minutes, and went away. And I didn’t hear of it till three days
Enter Input : afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for Lise
Enter Input : directly. She laughed. ‘He thought you were asleep,’ she said, ‘and came
Enter Input : in to me to ask after your health.’ Of course, that’s how it happened. But
Enter Input : Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me! Would you believe it, one
Enter Input : night, four days ago, just after you saw her last time, and had gone away,
Enter Input : she suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never
Enter Input : have hysterics? Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the
Enter Input : third, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly
Enter Input : screamed out, ‘I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting
Enter Input : him come to the house again.’ I was struck dumb at these amazing words,
Enter Input : and answered, ‘On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent
Enter Input : young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?’—for all
Enter Input : this business is a misfortune, isn’t it? She suddenly burst out laughing
Enter Input : at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I had
Enter Input : amused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse
Enter Input : to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without
Enter Input : my knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early this
Enter Input : morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you
Enter Input : believe it, slapped her in the face. That’s monstrous; I am always polite
Enter Input : to my servants. And an hour later she was hugging Yulia’s feet and kissing
Enter Input : them. She sent a message to me that she wasn’t coming to me at all, and
Enter Input : would never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her,
Enter Input : she rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of
Enter Input : the room without saying a word, so I couldn’t find out what was the
Enter Input : matter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of
Enter Input : course, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and
Enter Input : find out everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell
Enter Input : me—me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply
Enter Input : the death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no
Enter Input : more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then
Enter Input : something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!” cried
Enter Input : Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. “You
Enter Input : are late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense.
Enter Input : What does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To Lise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes. You won’t forget, you won’t forget what I asked you? It’s a
Enter Input : question of life and death!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course, I won’t forget, if I can ... but I am so late,” muttered
Enter Input : Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, be sure, be sure to come in; don’t say ‘If you can.’ I shall die if
Enter Input : you don’t,” Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had already left
Enter Input : the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. A Little Demon
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Going in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair, in
Enter Input : which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk. She did not move
Enter Input : to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his face.
Enter Input : There was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and yellow.
Enter Input : Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three
Enter Input : days. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand to him. He
Enter Input : touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he
Enter Input : sat down facing her, without a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,” Lise said curtly, “and
Enter Input : mamma’s kept you there for hours; she’s just been telling you about me and
Enter Input : Yulia.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you know?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do
Enter Input : listen, there’s no harm in that. I don’t apologize.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are upset about something?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “On the contrary, I am very happy. I’ve only just been reflecting for the
Enter Input : thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your
Enter Input : wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you and give you
Enter Input : a note to take to the man I loved after you, you’d take it and be sure to
Enter Input : give it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you were forty, you would
Enter Input : still go on taking my love-letters for me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She suddenly laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,” Alyosha
Enter Input : smiled to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you.
Enter Input : What’s more, I don’t want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.
Enter Input : Alyosha, why is it I don’t respect you? I am very fond of you, but I don’t
Enter Input : respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn’t talk to you without shame,
Enter Input : should I?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t believe it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha,
Enter Input : you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having so
Enter Input : quickly allowed me not to love you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to
Enter Input : torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I don’t
Enter Input : want to be happy.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are in love with disorder?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keep
Enter Input : imagining how I’ll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it must
Enter Input : be on the sly. They’ll try to put it out, but it’ll go on burning. And I
Enter Input : shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I am!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s your luxurious life,” said Alyosha, softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is it better, then, to be poor?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it is better.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what your monk taught you. That’s not true. Let me be rich and all
Enter Input : the rest poor, I’ll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one
Enter Input : else. Ach, don’t speak, don’t say anything,” she shook her hand at him,
Enter Input : though Alyosha had not opened his mouth. “You’ve told me all that before,
Enter Input : I know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder
Enter Input : somebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps—why do
Enter Input : nothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I’ll marry
Enter Input : you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we’ll keep a colt,
Enter Input : shall we? Do you know Kalganov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, ‘Why live in real life?
Enter Input : It’s better to dream. One can dream the most delightful things, but real
Enter Input : life is a bore.’ But he’ll be married soon for all that; he’s been making
Enter Input : love to me already. Can you spin tops?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, he’s just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning and
Enter Input : then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, I’ll keep
Enter Input : him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are awfully cross, because I don’t talk about holy things. I don’t
Enter Input : want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the
Enter Input : greatest sin? You must know all about that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God will censure you.” Alyosha was watching her steadily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure me,
Enter Input : and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like to
Enter Input : set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don’t believe me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set
Enter Input : fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It’s a sort of
Enter Input : disease.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not true, that’s not true; there may be children, but that’s not
Enter Input : what I mean.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You take evil for good; it’s a passing crisis, it’s the result of your
Enter Input : illness, perhaps.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You do despise me, though! It’s simply that I don’t want to do good, I
Enter Input : want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do evil?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be if
Enter Input : everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing a
Enter Input : fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a long
Enter Input : while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every one will
Enter Input : stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all.
Enter Input : That would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know. It’s a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, to
Enter Input : set fire to something. It happens sometimes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I not only say it, I shall do it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I believe you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying one
Enter Input : little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to
Enter Input : annoy you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do
Enter Input : that in it, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,” she declared, with a
Enter Input : strange fire in her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not a
Enter Input : trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun and
Enter Input : gayety never deserted her even at her most “earnest” moments.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves
Enter Input : crime, they love it always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, it’s as
Enter Input : though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about
Enter Input : it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all
Enter Input : love it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And are you still reading nasty books?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal
Enter Input : them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aren’t you ashamed to destroy yourself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I want to destroy myself. There’s a boy here, who lay down between the
Enter Input : railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, your
Enter Input : brother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves
Enter Input : his having killed his father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Loves his having killed his father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it’s so awful, but
Enter Input : secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is some truth in what you say about every one,” said Alyosha
Enter Input : softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, what ideas you have!” Lise shrieked in delight. “And you a monk, too!
Enter Input : You wouldn’t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies.
Enter Input : Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils.
Enter Input : It’s night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils
Enter Input : all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the
Enter Input : doors; there’s a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and
Enter Input : seize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross
Enter Input : myself and they all draw back, though they don’t go away altogether, they
Enter Input : stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have a
Enter Input : frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come
Enter Input : crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I cross myself
Enter Input : again and they all draw back. It’s awful fun. it takes one’s breath away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve had the same dream, too,” said Alyosha suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Really?” cried Lise, surprised. “I say, Alyosha, don’t laugh, that’s
Enter Input : awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It seems they can.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, I tell you, it’s awfully important,” Lise went on, with really
Enter Input : excessive amazement. “It’s not the dream that’s important, but your having
Enter Input : the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don’t lie now: is it true? You
Enter Input : are not laughing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s true.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was
Enter Input : silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,” she said suddenly,
Enter Input : in a supplicating voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll always come to see you, all my life,” answered Alyosha firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are the only person I can talk to, you know,” Lise began again. “I
Enter Input : talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to you
Enter Input : more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a
Enter Input : bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it
Enter Input : true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took a
Enter Input : child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and then
Enter Input : crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him, and
Enter Input : afterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, within
Enter Input : four hours. That was ‘soon’! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning and
Enter Input : he stood admiring it. That’s nice!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nice?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hang
Enter Input : there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple _compote_. I
Enter Input : am awfully fond of pineapple _compote_. Do you like it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly
Enter Input : contorted, her eyes burned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I kept
Enter Input : fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four years old
Enter Input : understands, you know), and all the while the thought of pineapple
Enter Input : _compote_ haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person,
Enter Input : begging him _particularly_ to come and see me. He came and I suddenly told
Enter Input : him all about the child and the pineapple _compote_. _All_ about it,
Enter Input : _all_, and said that it was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice.
Enter Input : Then he got up and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he
Enter Input : despise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise
Enter Input : me or not?” She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me,” Alyosha asked anxiously, “did you send for that person?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I did.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you send him a letter?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Simply to ask about that, about that child?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that at
Enter Input : once. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That person behaved honorably,” Alyosha murmured.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple _compote_ himself. He is
Enter Input : very ill now, too, Lise.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he does believe in it,” said Lise, with flashing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He doesn’t despise any one,” Alyosha went on. “Only he does not believe
Enter Input : any one. If he doesn’t believe in people, of course, he does despise
Enter Input : them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then he despises me, me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good,” Lise seemed to grind her teeth. “When he went out laughing, I felt
Enter Input : that it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is nice,
Enter Input : and to be despised is nice....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she laughed in Alyosha’s face, a feverish malicious laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like—Alyosha, save me!” She
Enter Input : suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with both
Enter Input : hands. “Save me!” she almost groaned. “Is there any one in the world I
Enter Input : could tell what I’ve told you? I’ve told you the truth, the truth. I shall
Enter Input : kill myself, because I loathe everything! I don’t want to live, because I
Enter Input : loathe everything! I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don’t you
Enter Input : love me in the least?” she finished in a frenzy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I do love you!” answered Alyosha warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And will you weep over me, will you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not because I won’t be your wife, but simply weep for me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank you! It’s only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me and
Enter Input : trample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting _any one_. For
Enter Input : I don’t love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hate
Enter Input : him! Go, Alyosha; it’s time you went to your brother”; she tore herself
Enter Input : away from him suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can I leave you like this?” said Alyosha, almost in alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here’s your hat. Give my
Enter Input : love to Mitya, go, go!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at her
Enter Input : with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right
Enter Input : hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it and
Enter Input : instantly read the address, “To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.” He looked
Enter Input : quickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give it to him, you must give it to him!” she ordered him, trembling and
Enter Input : beside herself. “To-day, at once, or I’ll poison myself! That’s why I sent
Enter Input : for you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the note
Enter Input : in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to Madame
Enter Input : Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone, Lise
Enter Input : unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack and
Enter Input : slammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten seconds
Enter Input : after, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat
Enter Input : up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the
Enter Input : blood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept
Enter Input : whispering rapidly to herself:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!”

Enter Input : Chapter IV. A Hymn And A Secret
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at the
Enter Input : prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he would
Enter Input : be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, as
Enter Input : everywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminary
Enter Input : inquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews
Enter Input : with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities. But later,
Enter Input : though the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at
Enter Input : least, of Mitya’s visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews with
Enter Input : the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically
Enter Input : _tête-à-tête_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha and
Enter Input : Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police, Mihail
Enter Input : Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His abuse of her
Enter Input : at Mokroe weighed on the old man’s conscience, and when he learned the
Enter Input : whole story, he completely changed his view of her. And strange to say,
Enter Input : though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in
Enter Input : prison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. “He
Enter Input : was a man of good heart, perhaps,” he thought, “who had come to grief from
Enter Input : drinking and dissipation.” His first horror had been succeeded by pity. As
Enter Input : for Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for
Enter Input : a long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to see
Enter Input : the prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the “police
Enter Input : captain’s young ladies,” as he called them, and was always hanging about
Enter Input : their house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,
Enter Input : too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his duties, was a
Enter Input : kind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long
Enter Input : standing with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him,
Enter Input : generally on sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in
Enter Input : awe of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself;
Enter Input : “self-taught,” of course. But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for
Enter Input : him. During the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal
Enter Input : Gospels, and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend.
Enter Input : He used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours
Enter Input : together with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the
Enter Input : prison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made
Enter Input : easy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had
Enter Input : grown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so long
Enter Input : as the authorities were satisfied.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to the
Enter Input : place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came upon
Enter Input : Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talking
Enter Input : loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while Rakitin
Enter Input : seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of
Enter Input : late. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha
Enter Input : enter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed
Enter Input : in buttoning his big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at
Enter Input : once for his umbrella.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I must mind not to forget my belongings,” he muttered, simply to say
Enter Input : something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mind you don’t forget other people’s belongings,” said Mitya, as a joke,
Enter Input : and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better give that advice to your own family, who’ve always been a
Enter Input : slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,” he cried, suddenly trembling with
Enter Input : anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter? I was joking,” cried Mitya. “Damn it all! They are all
Enter Input : like that,” he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin’s hurriedly
Enter Input : retreating figure. “He was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all at
Enter Input : once he boils up like that. He didn’t even nod to you. Have you broken
Enter Input : with him completely? Why are you so late? I’ve not been simply waiting,
Enter Input : but thirsting for you the whole morning. But never mind. We’ll make up for
Enter Input : it now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?”
Enter Input : asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin had
Enter Input : disappeared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likely—a pig
Enter Input : like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They can’t understand a
Enter Input : joke either, that’s the worst of such people. They never understand a
Enter Input : joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prison
Enter Input : walls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever fellow, very
Enter Input : clever. Well, Alexey, it’s all over with me now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, the trial’s to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?” Alyosha said,
Enter Input : with an apprehensive feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you talking about?” said Mitya, looking at him rather
Enter Input : uncertainly. “Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we’ve been
Enter Input : talking of things that don’t matter, about this trial, but I haven’t said
Enter Input : a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but it
Enter Input : wasn’t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you
Enter Input : look at me so critically?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean, Mitya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ideas, ideas, that’s all! Ethics! What is ethics?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ethics?” asked Alyosha, wondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; is it a science?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can’t explain to you
Enter Input : what sort of science it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He’s not going to be a
Enter Input : monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he’ll go in for criticism of an
Enter Input : elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career,
Enter Input : too. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career! Damn
Enter Input : ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than
Enter Input : any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karl Bernard?” Alyosha was surprised again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he?
Enter Input : Chemist or what?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He must be a savant,” answered Alyosha; “but I confess I can’t tell you
Enter Input : much about him, either. I’ve heard of him as a savant, but what sort I
Enter Input : don’t know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, damn him, then! I don’t know either,” swore Mitya. “A scoundrel of
Enter Input : some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make his
Enter Input : way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard. Ugh, these
Enter Input : Bernards! They are all over the place.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what is the matter?” Alyosha asked insistently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his
Enter Input : literary career. That’s what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants to
Enter Input : prove some theory. He wants to say ‘he couldn’t help murdering his father,
Enter Input : he was corrupted by his environment,’ and so on. He explained it all to
Enter Input : me. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn
Enter Input : the fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don’t care. He can’t bear
Enter Input : Ivan, he hates him. He’s not fond of you, either. But I don’t turn him
Enter Input : out, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him
Enter Input : just now, ‘The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for all
Enter Input : true Russians are philosophers, and though you’ve studied, you are not a
Enter Input : philosopher—you are a low fellow.’ He laughed, so maliciously. And I said
Enter Input : to him, ‘_De ideabus non est disputandum_.’ Isn’t that rather good? I can
Enter Input : set up for being a classic, you see!” Mitya laughed suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,” Alyosha interposed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why is it all over with me? H’m!... The fact of it is ... if you take it
Enter Input : as a whole, I am sorry to lose God—that’s why it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by ‘sorry to lose God’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head—that is, these nerves are
Enter Input : there in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, the
Enter Input : little tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ... that
Enter Input : is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin
Enter Input : quivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image
Enter Input : appears ... it doesn’t appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes
Enter Input : ... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment—devil
Enter Input : take the moment!—but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it!
Enter Input : That’s why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at all
Enter Input : because I’ve got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness.
Enter Input : All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother,
Enter Input : and it simply bowled me over. It’s magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A
Enter Input : new man’s arising—that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that’s a good thing, anyway,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That I am sorry to lose God? It’s chemistry, brother, chemistry! There’s
Enter Input : no help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry. And
Enter Input : Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn’t he dislike Him! That’s the sore
Enter Input : point with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend.
Enter Input : ‘Will you preach this in your reviews?’ I asked him. ‘Oh, well, if I did
Enter Input : it openly, they won’t let it through,’ he said. He laughed. ‘But what will
Enter Input : become of men then?’ I asked him, ‘without God and immortal life? All
Enter Input : things are lawful then, they can do what they like?’ ‘Didn’t you know?’ he
Enter Input : said laughing, ‘a clever man can do what he likes,’ he said. ‘A clever man
Enter Input : knows his way about, but you’ve put your foot in it, committing a murder,
Enter Input : and now you are rotting in prison.’ He says that to my face! A regular
Enter Input : pig! I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a
Enter Input : lot of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week.
Enter Input : I copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to put
Enter Input : one’s personality in contradiction to one’s reality.’ Do you understand
Enter Input : that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t,” said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him with
Enter Input : curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t understand either. It’s dark and obscure, but intellectual.
Enter Input : ‘Every one writes like that now,’ he says, ‘it’s the effect of their
Enter Input : environment.’ They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry, too,
Enter Input : the rascal. He’s written in honor of Madame Hohlakov’s foot. Ha ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve heard about it,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you? And have you heard the poem?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve got it. Here it is. I’ll read it to you. You don’t know—I haven’t
Enter Input : told you—there’s quite a story about it. He’s a rascal! Three weeks ago he
Enter Input : began to tease me. ‘You’ve got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the
Enter Input : sake of three thousand, but I’m going to collar a hundred and fifty
Enter Input : thousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.’ And
Enter Input : he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She hadn’t much brains in her
Enter Input : youth, and now at forty she has lost what she had. ‘But she’s awfully
Enter Input : sentimental,’ he says; ‘that’s how I shall get hold of her. When I marry
Enter Input : her, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.’
Enter Input : And his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for
Enter Input : the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to see
Enter Input : me every day. ‘She is coming round,’ he declared. He was beaming with
Enter Input : delight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house.
Enter Input : Perhotin’s carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly
Enter Input : old noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had written this
Enter Input : doggerel. ‘It’s the first time I’ve soiled my hands with writing poetry,’
Enter Input : he said. ‘It’s to win her heart, so it’s in a good cause. When I get hold
Enter Input : of the silly woman’s fortune, I can be of great social utility.’ They have
Enter Input : this social justification for every nasty thing they do! ‘Anyway it’s
Enter Input : better than your Pushkin’s poetry,’ he said, ‘for I’ve managed to advocate
Enter Input : enlightenment even in that.’ I understand what he means about Pushkin, I
Enter Input : quite see that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about
Enter Input : women’s feet. But wasn’t Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity
Enter Input : of these fellows! ‘On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object
Enter Input : of my affections’—he thought of that for a title. He’s a waggish fellow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     A captivating little foot,
Enter Input :     Though swollen and red and tender!
Enter Input :     The doctors come and plasters put,
Enter Input :     But still they cannot mend her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Yet, ’tis not for her foot I dread—
Enter Input :     A theme for Pushkin’s muse more fit—
Enter Input :     It’s not her foot, it is her head:
Enter Input :     I tremble for her loss of wit!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     For as her foot swells, strange to say,
Enter Input :     Her intellect is on the wane—
Enter Input :     Oh, for some remedy I pray
Enter Input :     That may restore both foot and brain!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He is a pig, a regular pig, but he’s very arch, the rascal! And he really
Enter Input : has put in a progressive idea. And wasn’t he angry when she kicked him
Enter Input : out! He was gnashing his teeth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s taken his revenge already,” said Alyosha. “He’s written a paragraph
Enter Input : about Madame Hohlakov.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s his doing, that’s his doing!” Mitya assented, frowning. “That’s
Enter Input : him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been
Enter Input : written about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... H’m!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked across the room with a harassed air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, I cannot stay long,” Alyosha said, after a pause. “To-morrow
Enter Input : will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be
Enter Input : accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I
Enter Input : don’t know what ...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, don’t be amazed at me,” Mitya broke in warmly. “Am I to talk of that
Enter Input : stinking dog? Of the murderer? We’ve talked enough of him. I don’t want to
Enter Input : say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you
Enter Input : will see. Hush!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Rakitin wouldn’t understand it,” he began in a sort of exaltation; “but
Enter Input : you, you’ll understand it all. That’s why I was thirsting for you. You
Enter Input : see, there’s so much I’ve been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here,
Enter Input : within these peeling walls, but I haven’t said a word about what matters
Enter Input : most; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I
Enter Input : must pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two months I’ve found
Enter Input : in myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me,
Enter Input : but would never have come to the surface, if it hadn’t been for this blow
Enter Input : from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years in
Enter Input : the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of that—it’s
Enter Input : something else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me. Even
Enter Input : there, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in another
Enter Input : convict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even
Enter Input : there one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen
Enter Input : heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bring
Enter Input : up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one
Enter Input : may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them,
Enter Input : hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamed
Enter Input : of that ‘babe’ at such a moment? ‘Why is the babe so poor?’ That was a
Enter Input : sign to me at that moment. It’s for the babe I’m going. Because we are all
Enter Input : responsible for all. For all the ‘babes,’ for there are big children as
Enter Input : well as little children. All are ‘babes.’ I go for all, because some one
Enter Input : must go for all. I didn’t kill father, but I’ve got to go. I accept it.
Enter Input : It’s all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are
Enter Input : numbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their
Enter Input : hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but
Enter Input : then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man
Enter Input : cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it’s His privilege—a grand
Enter Input : one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground
Enter Input : there without God? Rakitin’s laughing! If they drive God from the earth,
Enter Input : we shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison without God;
Enter Input : it’s even more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground
Enter Input : will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whom
Enter Input : is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. He
Enter Input : turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,” he began again. “You
Enter Input : wouldn’t believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst for
Enter Input : existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling
Enter Input : walls. Rakitin doesn’t understand that; all he cares about is building a
Enter Input : house and letting flats. But I’ve been longing for you. And what is
Enter Input : suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am
Enter Input : not afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I
Enter Input : won’t answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have such strength in
Enter Input : me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be
Enter Input : able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, ‘I exist.’ In thousands
Enter Input : of agonies—I exist. I’m tormented on the rack—but I exist! Though I sit
Enter Input : alone on a pillar—I exist! I see the sun, and if I don’t see the sun, I
Enter Input : know it’s there. And there’s a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun
Enter Input : is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me.
Enter Input : Damn them! Brother Ivan—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What of brother Ivan?” interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden
Enter Input : away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were
Enter Input : surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was to
Enter Input : stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not
Enter Input : Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he is
Enter Input : always silent. It’s God that’s worrying me. That’s the only thing that’s
Enter Input : worrying me. What if He doesn’t exist? What if Rakitin’s right—that it’s
Enter Input : an idea made up by men? Then if He doesn’t exist, man is the chief of the
Enter Input : earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good
Enter Input : without God? That’s the question. I always come back to that. For whom is
Enter Input : man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing
Enter Input : the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without
Enter Input : God. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can’t understand
Enter Input : it. Life’s easy for Rakitin. ‘You’d better think about the extension of
Enter Input : civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show
Enter Input : your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by
Enter Input : philosophy.’ I answered him, ‘Well, but you, without a God, are more
Enter Input : likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on
Enter Input : every copeck.’ He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer
Enter Input : me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a
Enter Input : Chinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? A
Enter Input : treacherous question! You won’t laugh if I tell you it’s kept me awake two
Enter Input : nights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.
Enter Input : Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It’s beyond me. But he is silent.
Enter Input : I believe he is a free-mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to
Enter Input : drink from the springs of his soul—he was silent. But once he did drop a
Enter Input : word.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did he say?” Alyosha took it up quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I said to him, ‘Then everything is lawful, if it is so?’ He frowned.
Enter Input : ‘Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,’ he said, ‘was a pig, but his ideas were
Enter Input : right enough.’ That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That was
Enter Input : going one better than Rakitin.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” Alyosha assented bitterly. “When was he with you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing
Enter Input : about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business here
Enter Input : is over and the verdict has been given, then I’ll tell you something. I’ll
Enter Input : tell you everything. We’ve something tremendous on hand.... And you shall
Enter Input : be my judge in it. But don’t begin about that now; be silent. You talk of
Enter Input : to-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about
Enter Input : it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you talked to the counsel?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He’s a soft,
Enter Input : city-bred rogue—a Bernard! But he doesn’t believe me—not a bit of it. Only
Enter Input : imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. ‘In that case,’ I asked him, ‘why
Enter Input : have you come to defend me?’ Hang them all! They’ve got a doctor down,
Enter Input : too, want to prove I’m mad. I won’t have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to
Enter Input : do her ‘duty’ to the end, whatever the strain!” Mitya smiled bitterly.
Enter Input : “The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe
Enter Input : that she was a woman of ‘great wrath.’ They repeated it. Yes, the facts
Enter Input : against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks to
Enter Input : his point. Grigory’s honest, but a fool. Many people are honest because
Enter Input : they are fools: that’s Rakitin’s idea. Grigory’s my enemy. And there are
Enter Input : some people who are better as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground
Enter Input : after that four thousand. She’ll pay it back to the last farthing. I don’t
Enter Input : want her sacrifice; they’ll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I
Enter Input : can stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the
Enter Input : court, can’t you? But damn it all, it doesn’t matter! I shall get through
Enter Input : somehow. I don’t pity her. It’s her own doing. She deserves what she gets.
Enter Input : I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.” He smiled bitterly again.
Enter Input : “Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such
Enter Input : suffering to bear?” he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. “Grusha’s killing
Enter Input : me; the thought of her’s killing me, killing me. She was with me just
Enter Input : now....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her as
Enter Input : she was going. I didn’t ask her forgiveness.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why didn’t you?” exclaimed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault
Enter Input : from a woman you love. From one you love especially, however greatly you
Enter Input : may have been in fault. For a woman—devil only knows what to make of a
Enter Input : woman! I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are
Enter Input : in fault to a woman. Say, ‘I am sorry, forgive me,’ and a shower of
Enter Input : reproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply and
Enter Input : directly, she’ll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have
Enter Input : never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her
Enter Input : own, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it.
Enter Input : She’ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They are
Enter Input : ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels
Enter Input : without whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy,
Enter Input : every decent man ought to be under some woman’s thumb. That’s my
Enter Input : conviction—not conviction, but feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and
Enter Input : it’s no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a Cæsar! But
Enter Input : don’t ever beg her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule
Enter Input : given you by your brother Mitya, who’s come to ruin through women. No, I’d
Enter Input : better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship
Enter Input : her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn’t see it. No, she still thinks I
Enter Input : don’t love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. The
Enter Input : past was nothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers
Enter Input : that tortured me, but now I’ve taken all her soul into my soul and through
Enter Input : her I’ve become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they don’t, I shall
Enter Input : die of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you
Enter Input : about me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened,
Enter Input : made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then she is not angry at my being jealous?” he exclaimed. “She is a
Enter Input : regular woman! ‘I’ve a fierce heart myself!’ Ah, I love such fierce
Enter Input : hearts, though I can’t bear any one’s being jealous of me. I can’t endure
Enter Input : it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely.
Enter Input : Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That’s the question. And
Enter Input : without her I can’t exist....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly
Enter Input : seemed terribly worried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So there’s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against
Enter Input : her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka,
Enter Input : that’s not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine
Enter Input : way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I’ll tell you our secret!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before
Enter Input : him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one
Enter Input : could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word
Enter Input : could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I will tell you all our secret,” Mitya whispered hurriedly. “I meant to
Enter Input : tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are
Enter Input : everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my
Enter Input : angel. It’s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it’s you that is
Enter Input : superior and not Ivan. You see, it’s a question of conscience, question of
Enter Input : the higher conscience—the secret is so important that I can’t settle it
Enter Input : myself, and I’ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it’s too
Enter Input : early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the
Enter Input : verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don’t decide it now. I’ll tell
Enter Input : you now. You listen, but don’t decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won’t tell
Enter Input : you everything. I’ll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep
Enter Input : quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what
Enter Input : shall I do with your eyes? I’m afraid your eyes will tell me your
Enter Input : decision, even if you don’t speak. Oo! I’m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan
Enter Input : suggests my _escaping_. I won’t tell you the details: it’s all been
Enter Input : thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don’t decide. I should go to
Enter Input : America with Grusha. You know I can’t live without Grusha! What if they
Enter Input : won’t let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan
Enter Input : thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a
Enter Input : hammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other
Enter Input : hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has
Enter Input : come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on
Enter Input : it. Ivan says that in America, ‘with the good-will,’ I can be of more use
Enter Input : than underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? What’s
Enter Input : America? America is vanity again! And there’s a lot of swindling in
Enter Input : America, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell
Enter Input : you, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand
Enter Input : this. There’s no one else. It’s folly, madness to others, all I’ve told
Enter Input : you of the hymn. They’ll say I’m out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of
Enter Input : my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He
Enter Input : understands, only he doesn’t answer—he doesn’t speak. He doesn’t believe
Enter Input : in the hymn. Don’t speak, don’t speak. I see how you look! You have
Enter Input : already decided. Don’t decide, spare me! I can’t live without Grusha. Wait
Enter Input : till after the trial!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on his
Enter Input : shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brother’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They don’t let convicts marry, do they?” he repeated for the third time
Enter Input : in a supplicating voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me one thing,” he said. “Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was
Enter Input : it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn’t come to see me at first,
Enter Input : then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away. He
Enter Input : is awfully keen on it. He doesn’t ask me, but orders me to escape. He
Enter Input : doesn’t doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my heart as I
Enter Input : have to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me he’d arrange it;
Enter Input : he’s found out about everything. But of that later. He’s simply set on it.
Enter Input : It’s all a matter of money: he’ll pay ten thousand for escape and give me
Enter Input : twenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent
Enter Input : escape for ten thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And he told you on no account to tell me?” Alyosha asked again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He is
Enter Input : afraid, no doubt, that you’ll stand before me as my conscience. Don’t tell
Enter Input : him I told you. Don’t tell him, for anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are right,” Alyosha pronounced; “it’s impossible to decide anything
Enter Input : before the trial is over. After the trial you’ll decide of yourself. Then
Enter Input : you’ll find that new man in yourself and he will decide.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A new man, or a Bernard who’ll decide _à la_ Bernard, for I believe I’m a
Enter Input : contemptible Bernard myself,” said Mitya, with a bitter grin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. “Alyosha,
Enter Input : darling, it’s time you were going,” he said, with a sudden haste. “There’s
Enter Input : the superintendent shouting in the yard. He’ll be here directly. We are
Enter Input : late; it’s irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the cross,
Enter Input : darling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They embraced and kissed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan,” said Mitya suddenly, “suggests my escaping; but, of course, he
Enter Input : believes I did it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A mournful smile came on to his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you asked him whether he believes it?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I haven’t. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t the courage. But I
Enter Input : saw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when
Enter Input : Mitya suddenly called him back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stand facing me! That’s right!” And again he seized Alyosha, putting both
Enter Input : hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it
Enter Input : was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips
Enter Input : twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe
Enter Input : I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don’t
Enter Input : lie!” he cried desperately.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a
Enter Input : stab at his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hush! What do you mean?” he faltered helplessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The whole truth, the whole, don’t lie!” repeated Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!” broke in
Enter Input : a shaking voice from Alyosha’s breast, and he raised his right hand in the
Enter Input : air, as though calling God to witness his words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya’s whole face was lighted up with bliss.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thank you!” he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him
Enter Input : after fainting. “Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it,
Enter Input : till this moment I’ve been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go!
Enter Input : You’ve given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along!
Enter Input : Love Ivan!” was Mitya’s last word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of
Enter Input : confidence even to him, to Alyosha—all this suddenly opened before Alyosha
Enter Input : an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his
Enter Input : unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly.
Enter Input : There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. “Love Ivan!”—he suddenly
Enter Input : recalled Mitya’s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see
Enter Input : Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more
Enter Input : than ever now.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. Not You, Not You!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was
Enter Input : living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved
Enter Input : to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now
Enter Input : it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the
Enter Input : terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted
Enter Input : by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he
Enter Input : recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, it’s only you,” said Ivan dryly. “Well, good-by! You are going to
Enter Input : her?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t advise you to; she’s upset and you’ll upset her more.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I have been with him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch,
Enter Input : you must come back, you must. Do you hear?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was such a peremptory note in Katya’s voice that Ivan, after a
Enter Input : moment’s hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She was listening,” he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,” said Ivan, going into the
Enter Input : drawing-room. “I won’t sit down. I won’t stay more than a minute.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” said Katerina Ivanovna, though she
Enter Input : remained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but there
Enter Input : was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that
Enter Input : she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did he ask you to tell me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only one thing,” said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, “that
Enter Input : you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what” (he was a
Enter Input : little confused) “... passed between you ... at the time of your first
Enter Input : acquaintance ... in that town.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!” She broke into a
Enter Input : bitter laugh. “Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to
Enter Input : spare—whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Both yourself and him,” he answered softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am glad to hear it,” she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly
Enter Input : blushed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said menacingly. “And I
Enter Input : don’t know myself yet. Perhaps you’ll want to trample me under foot after
Enter Input : my examination to-morrow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You will give your evidence honorably,” said Alyosha; “that’s all that’s
Enter Input : wanted.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Women are often dishonorable,” she snarled. “Only an hour ago I was
Enter Input : thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a
Enter Input : reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Is
Enter Input : he the murderer?” she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning
Enter Input : quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question
Enter Input : before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first
Enter Input : time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he
Enter Input : murdered his father. It’s only you I believed!” she continued, still
Enter Input : addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at
Enter Input : her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, that’s enough, anyway,” Ivan cut short the conversation. “I am
Enter Input : going. I’ll come to-morrow.” And turning at once, he walked out of the
Enter Input : room and went straight downstairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Follow him! Overtake him! Don’t leave him alone for a minute!” she said,
Enter Input : in a hurried whisper. “He’s mad! Don’t you know that he’s mad? He is in a
Enter Input : fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want?” He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was
Enter Input : running after him. “She told you to catch me up, because I’m mad. I know
Enter Input : it all by heart,” he added irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,” said
Enter Input : Alyosha. “I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their
Enter Input : mind?” Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of
Enter Input : irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And can one observe that one’s going mad oneself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I imagine one can’t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,” Alyosha
Enter Input : answered with surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan paused for half a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,” he said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,” said Alyosha timidly,
Enter Input : and he took Lise’s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were
Enter Input : just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, from that little demon!” he laughed maliciously, and, without opening
Enter Input : the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were
Enter Input : scattered by the wind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She’s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,” he said
Enter Input : contemptuously, striding along the street again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How do you mean, offering herself?” exclaimed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How can you, Ivan, how can you?” Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved
Enter Input : voice. “She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is very
Enter Input : ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped to
Enter Input : hear something from you ... that would save her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Be
Enter Input : quiet, Alexey. Don’t go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were silent again for a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to
Enter Input : act to-morrow at the trial,” he said sharply and angrily again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes. Whether she’s to save Mitya or ruin him. She’ll pray for light from
Enter Input : above. She can’t make up her mind for herself, you see. She has not had
Enter Input : time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants me to sing
Enter Input : lullabies to her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,” said Alyosha sadly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give
Enter Input : her hope?” Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. “I know that you’ve given
Enter Input : her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,” he added.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I can’t behave to her as I ought—break off altogether and tell her so
Enter Input : straight out,” said Ivan, irritably. “I must wait till sentence is passed
Enter Input : on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge herself on
Enter Input : me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she hates him and
Enter Input : knows she hates him. It’s all a lie—lie upon lie! As long as I don’t break
Enter Input : off with her, she goes on hoping, and she won’t ruin that monster, knowing
Enter Input : how I want to get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would
Enter Input : come!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The words “murderer” and “monster” echoed painfully in Alyosha’s heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But how can she ruin Mitya?” he asked, pondering on Ivan’s words. “What
Enter Input : evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t know that yet. She’s got a document in her hands, in Mitya’s
Enter Input : own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s impossible!” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why is it impossible? I’ve read it myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There can’t be such a document!” Alyosha repeated warmly. “There can’t
Enter Input : be, because he’s not the murderer. It’s not he murdered father, not he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan suddenly stopped.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is the murderer then, according to you?” he asked, with apparent
Enter Input : coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know who,” Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know who,” broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who? Who?” Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly
Enter Input : vanished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I only know one thing,” Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, “_it
Enter Input : wasn’t you_ killed father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Not you’! What do you mean by ‘not you’?” Ivan was thunderstruck.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was not you killed father, not you!” Alyosha repeated firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The silence lasted for half a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know I didn’t. Are you raving?” said Ivan, with a pale, distorted
Enter Input : smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under a
Enter Input : lamp-post.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Ivan. You’ve told yourself several times that you are the murderer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?” Ivan
Enter Input : faltered helplessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve said so to yourself many times, when you’ve been alone during
Enter Input : these two dreadful months,” Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as
Enter Input : before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his
Enter Input : own will, but obeying some irresistible command. “You have accused
Enter Input : yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no
Enter Input : one else. But you didn’t do it: you are mistaken: you are not the
Enter Input : murderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They were
Enter Input : both standing still, gazing into each other’s eyes. They were both pale.
Enter Input : Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha’s shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve been in my room!” he whispered hoarsely. “You’ve been there at
Enter Input : night, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Whom do you mean—Mitya?” Alyosha asked, bewildered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not him, damn the monster!” Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. “Do you know that
Enter Input : he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is _he_! I don’t know whom you are talking about,” Alyosha faltered,
Enter Input : beginning to be alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, you do know ... or how could you—? It’s impossible that you don’t
Enter Input : know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to reflect.
Enter Input : A strange grin contorted his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother,” Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, “I have said this to
Enter Input : you, because you’ll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and for
Enter Input : all, it’s not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into my heart to
Enter Input : say this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alexey Fyodorovitch,” he said, with a cold smile, “I can’t endure
Enter Input : prophets and epileptics—messengers from God especially—and you know that
Enter Input : only too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment and
Enter Input : probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. It’s the way to
Enter Input : your lodgings, too. You’d better be particularly careful not to come to me
Enter Input : to-day! Do you hear?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother,” Alyosha called after him, “if anything happens to you to-day,
Enter Input : turn to me before any one!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross
Enter Input : roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and walked
Enter Input : slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neither
Enter Input : of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s empty house. Alyosha
Enter Input : had a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived some
Enter Input : distance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge
Enter Input : attached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of
Enter Input : an official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who
Enter Input : went to bed at six o’clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.
Enter Input : Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and very
Enter Input : fond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one room he
Enter Input : lived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when he
Enter Input : suddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.
Enter Input : Suddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked with
Enter Input : rapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half to a
Enter Input : tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the
Enter Input : neighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s kitchen for soup and to
Enter Input : whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now
Enter Input : lodging. She had sold their little house, and was now living here with her
Enter Input : mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill—almost dying—had been with them ever since
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch’s death. It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by a
Enter Input : sudden and irresistible prompting.

Enter Input : Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his
Enter Input : return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him was
Enter Input : on the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, a
Enter Input : fortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that it
Enter Input : was now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard
Enter Input : anything of him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan had only returned five days after his father’s death, so that he was
Enter Input : not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back.
Enter Input : The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address,
Enter Input : had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, not
Enter Input : knowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning
Enter Input : on Ivan’s going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did
Enter Input : not go to them till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram,
Enter Input : he had, of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him
Enter Input : was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to
Enter Input : the general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion
Enter Input : against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on,
Enter Input : after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the
Enter Input : details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised at
Enter Input : Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly
Enter Input : feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very
Enter Input : fond.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan’s feeling to his brother
Enter Input : Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassion
Enter Input : for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance.
Enter Input : Mitya’s whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractive
Enter Input : to him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna’s love for his
Enter Input : brother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and
Enter Input : that interview, far from shaking Ivan’s belief in his guilt, positively
Enter Input : strengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya
Enter Input : had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violent
Enter Input : language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked
Enter Input : principally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had been
Enter Input : “stolen” from him by his father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The money was mine, it was my money,” Mitya kept repeating. “Even if I
Enter Input : had stolen it, I should have had the right.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a
Enter Input : fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardly
Enter Input : seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite the
Enter Input : contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; he
Enter Input : was continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughed
Enter Input : contemptuously at Grigory’s evidence about the open door, and declared
Enter Input : that it was “the devil that opened it.” But he could not bring forward any
Enter Input : coherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan
Enter Input : during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for
Enter Input : people who declared that “everything was lawful,” to suspect and question
Enter Input : him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.
Enter Input : Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time
Enter Input : to see Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of
Enter Input : Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he
Enter Input : went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he
Enter Input : gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the
Enter Input : time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : who was at that time in the hospital.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital,
Enter Input : confidently asserted in reply to Ivan’s persistent questions, that
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised
Enter Input : indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day
Enter Input : of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an
Enter Input : exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that
Enter Input : the patient’s life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after
Enter Input : they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the
Enter Input : patient would survive. “Though it might well be,” added Doctor
Enter Input : Herzenstube, “that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period,
Enter Input : if not permanently.” On Ivan’s asking impatiently whether that meant that
Enter Input : he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full
Enter Input : sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan
Enter Input : decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov was
Enter Input : lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was only one other bed in
Enter Input : the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, who
Enter Input : was obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to their
Enter Input : conversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the
Enter Input : first instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only
Enter Input : momentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he
Enter Input : was very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his
Enter Input : tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the
Enter Input : interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining of headache
Enter Input : and of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate face seemed to have
Enter Input : become so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his crest of curls in front
Enter Input : stood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye, which was screwed up and
Enter Input : seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged.
Enter Input : “It’s always worth while speaking to a clever man.” Ivan was reminded of
Enter Input : that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with
Enter Input : painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to
Enter Input : speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you talk to me?” asked Ivan. “I won’t tire you much.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly I can,” mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. “Has your honor
Enter Input : been back long?” he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous
Enter Input : visitor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.” Smerdyakov
Enter Input : sighed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,” Ivan blurted out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell
Enter Input : it would turn out like that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What would turn out? Don’t prevaricate! You’ve foretold you’d have a fit;
Enter Input : on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you said so at the examination yet?” Smerdyakov queried with
Enter Input : composure.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan felt suddenly angry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I haven’t yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great deal
Enter Input : to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with
Enter Input : me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God
Enter Input : Almighty?” said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment
Enter Input : closing his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the first place,” began Ivan, “I know that epileptic fits can’t be
Enter Input : told beforehand. I’ve inquired; don’t try and take me in. You can’t
Enter Input : foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour
Enter Input : beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you would
Enter Input : fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn’t sham a fit on
Enter Input : purpose?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,”
Enter Input : Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. “I fell from the garret just in the same
Enter Input : way a year ago. It’s quite true you can’t tell the day and hour of a fit
Enter Input : beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you did foretell the day and the hour!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctors
Enter Input : here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; it’s no use my
Enter Input : saying any more about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to the
Enter Input : cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most was
Enter Input : losing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I went down
Enter Input : into the cellar thinking, ‘Here, it’ll come on directly, it’ll strike me
Enter Input : down directly, shall I fall?’ And it was through this fear that I suddenly
Enter Input : felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying. All that and
Enter Input : all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when
Enter Input : I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that
Enter Input : to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer,
Enter Input : and it’s all been written down in the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr.
Enter Input : Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it
Enter Input : brought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that
Enter Input : the fit seized me. And so they’ve written it down, that it’s just how it
Enter Input : must have happened, simply from my fear.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you have said all that in your evidence?” said Ivan, somewhat taken
Enter Input : aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their
Enter Input : conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all
Enter Input : himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,”
Enter Input : Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not to say every word.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I didn’t tell them that either.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was afraid you’d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get
Enter Input : out of the way of trouble.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,
Enter Input : foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare
Enter Input : myself even more. That’s why I told you to get out of harm’s way, that you
Enter Input : might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would
Enter Input : remain at home to protect your father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!” Ivan suddenly fired
Enter Input : up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that
Enter Input : made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have been
Enter Input : apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away
Enter Input : that money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tell
Enter Input : that it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he would only
Enter Input : carry off the three thousand that lay under the master’s mattress in the
Enter Input : envelope, and you see, he’s murdered him. How could you guess it either,
Enter Input : sir?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But if you say yourself that it couldn’t be guessed, how could I have
Enter Input : guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!” said Ivan,
Enter Input : pondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to
Enter Input : Moscow.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could I guess it from that?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to
Enter Input : Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for
Enter Input : Moscow’s a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not far
Enter Input : off, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might have
Enter Input : come to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch’s
Enter Input : illness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those
Enter Input : knocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that
Enter Input : Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would
Enter Input : guess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn’t go
Enter Input : to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He talks very coherently,” thought Ivan, “though he does mumble; what’s
Enter Input : the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are cunning with me, damn you!” he exclaimed, getting angry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,” Smerdyakov parried
Enter Input : with the simplest air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I’d guessed, I should have stayed,” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in
Enter Input : such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save
Enter Input : yourself in your fright.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, I thought you were like me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course, I ought to have guessed,” Ivan said in agitation; “and I did
Enter Input : guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying,
Enter Input : you are lying again,” he cried, suddenly recollecting. “Do you remember
Enter Input : how you went up to the carriage and said to me, ‘It’s always worth while
Enter Input : speaking to a clever man’? So you were glad I went away, since you praised
Enter Input : me?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I was pleased,” he articulated rather breathlessly, “it was simply
Enter Input : because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it was
Enter Input : nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way of
Enter Input : praise, but of reproach. You didn’t understand it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What reproach?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and
Enter Input : would not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealing
Enter Input : that three thousand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn you!” Ivan swore again. “Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and the
Enter Input : investigating lawyer about those knocks?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I told them everything just as it was.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan wondered inwardly again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I thought of anything then,” he began again, “it was solely of some
Enter Input : wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would steal—I
Enter Input : did not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness from
Enter Input : you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that
Enter Input : for?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on
Enter Input : purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just
Enter Input : foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What else is left for him to do?” said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.
Enter Input : “And who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory
Enter Input : Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never
Enter Input : mind him! He is trembling to save himself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is
Enter Input : the work of my hands—I’ve heard that already. But as to my being clever at
Enter Input : shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one,
Enter Input : if I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been
Enter Input : planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such
Enter Input : evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is
Enter Input : that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one
Enter Input : hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to
Enter Input : tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me
Enter Input : completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if
Enter Input : he is so open-hearted beforehand? Any one can see that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well,” and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s last argument. “I don’t suspect you at all, and I think it’s
Enter Input : absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you for
Enter Input : setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but I’ll come again. Meanwhile,
Enter Input : good-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me,
Enter Input : and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good people
Enter Input : visit me every day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by. But I shan’t say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and
Enter Input : I don’t advise you to, either,” something made Ivan say suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I quite understand. And if you don’t speak of that, I shall say nothing
Enter Input : of that conversation of ours at the gate.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozen
Enter Input : steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insulting
Enter Input : significance in Smerdyakov’s last words. He was almost on the point of
Enter Input : turning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering,
Enter Input : “Nonsense!” he went out of the hospital.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might have
Enter Input : been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the reason
Enter Input : for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his
Enter Input : sensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something.
Enter Input : In the following days he became convinced of Mitya’s guilt, as he got to
Enter Input : know all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people
Enter Input : of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it
Enter Input : was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at
Enter Input : Plotnikov’s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence
Enter Input : seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of
Enter Input : the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory’s evidence as
Enter Input : to the open door. Grigory’s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan’s questions,
Enter Input : declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the
Enter Input : partition wall. “He was not three paces from our bed,” and that although
Enter Input : she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, “He
Enter Input : was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was
Enter Input : not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle
Enter Input : smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know how he spends his time now?” he asked; “learning lists of
Enter Input : French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the
Enter Input : French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he
Enter Input : he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without
Enter Input : repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that
Enter Input : Dmitri was not the murderer, and that “in all probability” Smerdyakov was.
Enter Input : Ivan always felt that Alyosha’s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so
Enter Input : he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that
Enter Input : Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he
Enter Input : never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,
Enter Input : struck Ivan particularly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart
Enter Input : from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to
Enter Input : his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time
Enter Input : to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan’s, which left its mark on
Enter Input : all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another
Enter Input : novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here
Enter Input : that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I’ve related
Enter Input : already, told him, “I am not keen on her,” it was an absolute lie: he
Enter Input : loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have
Enter Input : murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by
Enter Input : what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan’s return to meet him as
Enter Input : her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings.
Enter Input : And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently
Enter Input : before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she
Enter Input : considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not
Enter Input : abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov
Enter Input : violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She was
Enter Input : continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted
Enter Input : Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were
Enter Input : numerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyosha
Enter Input : “lies upon lies.” There was, of course, much that was false in it, and
Enter Input : that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov’s existence, and yet,
Enter Input : a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted by the
Enter Input : same strange thoughts as before. It’s enough to say that he was
Enter Input : continually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and
Enter Input : listened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he recalled that
Enter Input : afterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly so
Enter Input : depressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to
Enter Input : himself, “I am a scoundrel”? And now he almost fancied that these
Enter Input : tormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so
Enter Input : completely did they take possession of him again. It was just after
Enter Input : fancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once,
Enter Input : and put a question to him:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and
Enter Input : afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved ‘the right to
Enter Input : desire’?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father’s death or
Enter Input : not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did think so,” answered Alyosha, softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn’t you fancy
Enter Input : then that what I wished was just that ‘one reptile should devour another’;
Enter Input : that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ...
Enter Input : and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother’s face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak!” cried Ivan, “I want above everything to know what you thought
Enter Input : then. I want the truth, the truth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,” whispered Alyosha, and
Enter Input : he did not add one softening phrase.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Thanks,” snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way.
Enter Input : From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and
Enter Input : seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gave
Enter Input : up going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had not
Enter Input : gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knew
Enter Input : his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a
Enter Input : passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother, and
Enter Input : on the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them,
Enter Input : whether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had
Enter Input : come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna’s betrothed, and was living
Enter Input : there for a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and
Enter Input : daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly
Enter Input : superior to themselves.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the
Enter Input : passage. By Marya Kondratyevna’s directions he went straight to the better
Enter Input : room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in the
Enter Input : room and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with blue paper, which
Enter Input : was a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroaches
Enter Input : swarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling from
Enter Input : them. The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and two
Enter Input : chairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with
Enter Input : pink patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little
Enter Input : windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table stood a
Enter Input : little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But
Enter Input : Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at the
Enter Input : table on a bench. He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing
Enter Input : with a pen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick,
Enter Input : but with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov’s face that
Enter Input : he had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,
Enter Input : fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the
Enter Input : sides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather
Enter Input : dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which Ivan had
Enter Input : never seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenly
Enter Input : redoubled Ivan’s anger: “A creature like that and wearing spectacles!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor
Enter Input : through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from the
Enter Input : bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least
Enter Input : possible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly; he
Enter Input : took it all in and noted it at once—most of all the look in Smerdyakov’s
Enter Input : eyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. “What do you want to
Enter Input : intrude for?” it seemed to say; “we settled everything then; why have you
Enter Input : come again?” Ivan could scarcely control himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s hot here,” he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Take off your coat,” Smerdyakov conceded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He
Enter Input : took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakov
Enter Input : managed to sit down on his bench before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To begin with, are we alone?” Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. “Can
Enter Input : they overhear us in there?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No one can hear anything. You’ve seen for yourself: there’s a passage.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving the
Enter Input : hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, you
Enter Input : wouldn’t tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate?
Enter Input : What do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by it? Were you threatening
Enter Input : me? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am
Enter Input : afraid of you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obvious
Enter Input : intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show
Enter Input : his cards. Smerdyakov’s eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye winked, and
Enter Input : he at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and deliberation.
Enter Input : “You want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,”
Enter Input : he seemed to say.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowing
Enter Input : beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his fate, and
Enter Input : that people mightn’t after that conclude any evil about your feelings and
Enter Input : perhaps of something else, too—that’s what I promised not to tell the
Enter Input : authorities.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself,
Enter Input : yet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic, resentful
Enter Input : and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist passed before
Enter Input : Ivan’s eyes for the first moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How? What? Are you out of your mind?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’m perfectly in possession of all my faculties.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you suppose I _knew_ of the murder?” Ivan cried at last, and he
Enter Input : brought his fist violently on the table. “What do you mean by ‘something
Enter Input : else, too’? Speak, scoundrel!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that ‘something else, too’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The ‘something else’ I meant was that you probably, too, were very
Enter Input : desirous of your parent’s death.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so that
Enter Input : he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed in tears.
Enter Input : Saying, “It’s a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,” he dried his eyes with
Enter Input : a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minute
Enter Input : passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s enough! Leave off,” Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.
Enter Input : “Don’t put me out of all patience.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered face
Enter Input : reflected the insult he had just received.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant to
Enter Input : kill my father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I didn’t know what thoughts were in your mind then,” said Smerdyakov
Enter Input : resentfully; “and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that
Enter Input : very point.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To sound what, what?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be
Enter Input : murdered or not.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent tone
Enter Input : to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was you murdered him?” he cried suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn’t I murdered him. And I
Enter Input : should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of
Enter Input : it again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a
Enter Input : position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to
Enter Input : sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then
Enter Input : the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly,
Enter Input : too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Look here, you didn’t say that a fortnight ago.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought
Enter Input : you’d understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible man
Enter Input : you wouldn’t care to talk of it openly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I
Enter Input : have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As for the murder, you couldn’t have done that and didn’t want to, but as
Enter Input : for wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it;
Enter Input : what grounds had I for wanting it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?” said Smerdyakov
Enter Input : sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. “Why, after your parent’s
Enter Input : death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and very
Enter Input : likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady,
Enter Input : Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made over to her
Enter Input : directly after the wedding, for she’s plenty of sense, so that your parent
Enter Input : would not have left you two roubles between the three of you. And were
Enter Input : they far from a wedding, either? Not a hair’s-breadth: that lady had only
Enter Input : to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with
Enter Input : his tongue out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Very good,” he commented at last. “You see, I haven’t jumped up, I
Enter Input : haven’t knocked you down, I haven’t killed you. Speak on. So, according to
Enter Input : you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would lose
Enter Input : all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go off to
Enter Input : exile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother
Enter Input : Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you’d each have not forty, but
Enter Input : sixty thousand each. There’s not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on any
Enter Input : one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I did
Enter Input : expect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember my
Enter Input : impression!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on me
Enter Input : as well,” said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. “So that it was just by
Enter Input : that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. For if you
Enter Input : had a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me,
Enter Input : ‘You can murder my parent, I won’t hinder you!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You scoundrel! So that’s how you understood it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go to
Enter Input : Moscow and refused all your father’s entreaties to go to Tchermashnya—and
Enter Input : simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once! What reason had
Enter Input : you to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to Tchermashnya with no
Enter Input : reason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected something
Enter Input : from me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I swear I didn’t!” shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You didn’t? Then you ought, as your father’s son, to have had me taken to
Enter Input : the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, to
Enter Input : have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bit
Enter Input : angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish
Enter Input : word and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayed
Enter Input : to save your parent’s life. How could I help drawing my conclusions?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I am sorry I didn’t punch you in the face,” he said with a bitter
Enter Input : smile. “I couldn’t have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would have
Enter Input : believed me and what charge could I bring against you? But the punch in
Enter Input : the face ... oh, I’m sorry I didn’t think of it. Though blows are
Enter Input : forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In the ordinary occasions of life,” he said in the same complacent and
Enter Input : sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about
Enter Input : religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s table, “in the ordinary occasions of life,
Enter Input : blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have given
Enter Input : them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows,
Enter Input : not only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republic
Enter Input : of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave
Enter Input : off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you learning French words for?” Ivan nodded towards the
Enter Input : exercise-book lying on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why shouldn’t I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that
Enter Input : I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, monster.” Ivan’s eyes flashed and he trembled all over. “I am not
Enter Input : afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I
Enter Input : don’t beat you to death, it’s simply because I suspect you of that crime
Enter Input : and I’ll drag you to justice. I’ll unmask you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To my thinking, you’d better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of,
Enter Input : considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if you
Enter Input : begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you think I am afraid of you now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If the court doesn’t believe all I’ve said to you just now, the public
Enter Input : will, and you will be ashamed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s as much as to say, ‘It’s always worth while speaking to a sensible
Enter Input : man,’ eh?” snarled Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You hit the mark, indeed. And you’d better be sensible.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and
Enter Input : without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him,
Enter Input : walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him.
Enter Input : There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations
Enter Input : filled his soul. “Shall I go at once and give information against
Enter Input : Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On
Enter Input : the contrary, he’ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for
Enter Input : Tchermashnya then? What for? What for?” Ivan asked himself. “Yes, of
Enter Input : course, I was expecting something and he is right....” And he remembered
Enter Input : for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father’s house, he
Enter Input : had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish
Enter Input : that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. “Yes, I
Enter Input : expected it then, that’s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder!
Enter Input : Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don’t
Enter Input : dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed
Enter Input : her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his
Enter Input : conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn’t be calmed,
Enter Input : however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room,
Enter Input : speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on
Enter Input : the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange
Enter Input : sentence: “If it’s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who’s the murderer, I share
Enter Input : his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don’t know yet. But if
Enter Input : he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer,
Enter Input : too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a
Enter Input : word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out a
Enter Input : sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which
Enter Input : Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a “conclusive proof” that Dmitri had
Enter Input : killed his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on
Enter Input : the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna’s, when
Enter Input : Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed
Enter Input : to Grushenka. I don’t know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was
Enter Input : at the “Metropolis,” where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen
Enter Input : and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was
Enter Input : a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was
Enter Input : like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with
Enter Input : extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has
Enter Input : just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine
Enter Input : fellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out;
Enter Input : and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with
Enter Input : drunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty
Enter Input : piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the
Enter Input : tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was
Enter Input : evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only
Enter Input : filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.
Enter Input : The letter ran as follows:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     FATAL KATYA: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three
Enter Input :     thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my
Enter Input :     love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it from
Enter Input :     every one, and if I can’t borrow it, I give you my word of honor I
Enter Input :     shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from
Enter Input :     under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to
Enter Input :     Siberia for it, I’ll give you back your three thousand. And
Enter Input :     farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for I’ve been a
Enter Input :     scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you’ll be
Enter Input :     happier and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love
Enter Input :     another woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can
Enter Input :     you forgive? I will murder the man who’s robbed me! I’ll leave you
Enter Input :     all and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not _her_
Enter Input :     either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     P.S.—I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. One
Enter Input :     string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I
Enter Input :     shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three
Enter Input :     thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I’ve been a
Enter Input :     scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand.
Enter Input :     The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a
Enter Input :     thief, but I’ll murder my thief. Katya, don’t look disdainful.
Enter Input :     Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father
Enter Input :     and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your
Enter Input :     pride. And he doesn’t love you.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     P.P.S.—I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.—Katya, pray to God
Enter Input :     that some one’ll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in
Enter Input :     gore, and if no one does—I shall! Kill me!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Your slave and enemy,
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     D. KARAMAZOV.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Ivan read this “document” he was convinced. So then it was his
Enter Input : brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This
Enter Input : letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There
Enter Input : could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya’s guilt. The suspicion
Enter Input : never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the
Enter Input : murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not
Enter Input : fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he
Enter Input : only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later
Enter Input : he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at
Enter Input : his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him.
Enter Input : So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice
Enter Input : he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’ll end in madness,” the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and
Enter Input : Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself
Enter Input : began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been
Enter Input : sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time
Enter Input : his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were
Enter Input : like two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna’s “returns”
Enter Input : to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his
Enter Input : favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene
Enter Input : described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan
Enter Input : had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya’s
Enter Input : guilt, in spite of those “returns” that were so hateful to him. It is
Enter Input : remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more
Enter Input : every day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya’s “returns”
Enter Input : that he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_.
Enter Input : He was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed
Enter Input : to him a plan of escape—a plan he had obviously thought over a long time.
Enter Input : He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart
Enter Input : from a phrase of Smerdyakov’s, that it was to his, Ivan’s, advantage that
Enter Input : his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance
Enter Input : and Alyosha’s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to
Enter Input : sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya’s escape. On his return from
Enter Input : seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel
Enter Input : that he was anxious for Mitya’s escape, not only to heal that sore place
Enter Input : by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. “Is it because I
Enter Input : am as much a murderer at heart?” he asked himself. Something very deep
Enter Input : down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered
Enter Input : cruelly all that month. But of that later....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his
Enter Input : hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden
Enter Input : and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha’s presence: “It was
Enter Input : you, you, persuaded me of his” (that is, Mitya’s) “guilt!” Ivan was
Enter Input : thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her
Enter Input : that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in
Enter Input : her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_,
Enter Input : she, who had produced that “document” and proved his brother’s guilt. And
Enter Input : now she suddenly exclaimed: “I’ve been at Smerdyakov’s myself!” When had
Enter Input : she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so
Enter Input : sure of Mitya’s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What,
Enter Input : what, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could
Enter Input : not understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words
Enter Input : pass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and
Enter Input : rushed off to Smerdyakov. “I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,” he
Enter Input : thought on the way.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing early
Enter Input : that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly. It did
Enter Input : not lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the wind, and soon there
Enter Input : was a regular snowstorm. There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of
Enter Input : the town where Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness,
Enter Input : unconscious of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head
Enter Input : ached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his
Enter Input : hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna’s
Enter Input : cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant. He was
Enter Input : wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was walking in zigzags, grumbling
Enter Input : and swearing to himself. Then suddenly he would begin singing in a husky
Enter Input : drunken voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     “Ach, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;
Enter Input :     I won’t wait till he comes back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again;
Enter Input : then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an intense hatred for
Enter Input : him before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he realized his
Enter Input : presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down. At that
Enter Input : moment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt
Enter Input : against Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. The peasant went flying
Enter Input : backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground. He uttered one
Enter Input : plaintive “O—oh!” and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was
Enter Input : lying on his back, without movement or consciousness. “He will be frozen,”
Enter Input : thought Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov’s.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with a
Enter Input : candle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, “It’s not that
Enter Input : he’s laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even told us to take the
Enter Input : tea away; he wouldn’t have any.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, does he make a row?” asked Ivan coarsely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he’s very quiet. Only please don’t talk
Enter Input : to him too long,” Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan opened the door and
Enter Input : stepped into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room. One of
Enter Input : the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been put a
Enter Input : large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up, with
Enter Input : fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearing
Enter Input : the same dressing-gown. The table had been brought out in front of the
Enter Input : sofa, so that there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a thick book
Enter Input : in yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be
Enter Input : sitting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was
Enter Input : apparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in
Enter Input : his face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and there
Enter Input : were blue marks under them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you really are ill?” Ivan stopped short. “I won’t keep you long, I
Enter Input : won’t even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down on
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you look at me without speaking? I’ve only come with one question,
Enter Input : and I swear I won’t go without an answer. Has the young lady, Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, been with you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.
Enter Input : Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s the matter with you?” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by ‘nothing’?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, she has. It’s no matter to you. Let me alone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I won’t let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, I’d quite forgotten about her,” said Smerdyakov, with a scornful
Enter Input : smile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him with a look of
Enter Input : frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on him at their last
Enter Input : interview, a month before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don’t look like
Enter Input : yourself,” he said to Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow. Are you so
Enter Input : worried?” He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen; I’ve told you I won’t go away without an answer!” Ivan cried,
Enter Input : intensely irritated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?” said Smerdyakov,
Enter Input : with a look of suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Damn it! I’ve nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and I’ll go
Enter Input : away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve no answer to give you,” said Smerdyakov, looking down again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You may be sure I’ll make you answer!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why are you so uneasy?” Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply with
Enter Input : contempt, but almost with repulsion. “Is this because the trial begins
Enter Input : to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can’t you believe that at last? Go
Enter Input : home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don’t be afraid of anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?” Ivan
Enter Input : articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in
Enter Input : fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t understand?” he drawled reproachfully. “It’s a strange thing a
Enter Input : sensible man should care to play such a farce!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious tone
Enter Input : of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in itself. He
Enter Input : had not taken such a tone even at their last interview.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I tell you, you’ve nothing to be afraid of. I won’t say anything about
Enter Input : you; there’s no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling!
Enter Input : Why are your fingers moving like that? Go home, _you_ did not murder him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan started. He remembered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I know it was not I,” he faltered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you?” Smerdyakov caught him up again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes on Ivan
Enter Input : with insane hatred.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, it was you who murdered him, if that’s it,” he whispered furiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He laughed
Enter Input : malignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understand
Enter Input : it now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All I understand is that you are mad.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aren’t you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what’s the use of going
Enter Input : on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it all
Enter Input : on me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real murderer, I was
Enter Input : only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your
Enter Input : words I did it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?” Ivan turned cold.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over with
Enter Input : a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly; probably
Enter Input : the genuineness of Ivan’s horror struck him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t mean to say you really did not know?” he faltered
Enter Input : mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still gazed
Enter Input : at him, and seemed unable to speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     Ach, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;
Enter Input :     I won’t wait till he comes back,
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : suddenly echoed in his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting before
Enter Input : me,” he muttered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he is
Enter Input : here, that third, between us.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is he? Who is here? What third person?” Ivan cried in alarm, looking
Enter Input : about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That third is God Himself—Providence. He is the third beside us now. Only
Enter Input : don’t look for Him, you won’t find Him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a lie that you killed him!” Ivan cried madly. “You are mad, or
Enter Input : teasing me again!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of fear. He
Enter Input : could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied that Ivan
Enter Input : knew everything and was trying to “throw it all on him to his face.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wait a minute,” he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing up
Enter Input : his left leg from under the table, he began turning up his trouser leg. He
Enter Input : was wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he took off his
Enter Input : garter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and
Enter Input : suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s mad!” he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that he
Enter Input : knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and
Enter Input : straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirely
Enter Input : unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his stocking, as though he
Enter Input : were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull
Enter Input : it out. At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that
Enter Input : it was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it
Enter Input : out and laid it on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here,” he said quietly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it?” asked Ivan, trembling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Kindly look at it,” Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began
Enter Input : unfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from
Enter Input : contact with a loathsome reptile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your hands keep twitching,” observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately
Enter Input : unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets of
Enter Input : hundred-rouble notes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not count
Enter Input : them. Take them,” Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes. Ivan
Enter Input : sank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You frightened me ... with your stocking,” he said, with a strange grin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Can you really not have known till now?” Smerdyakov asked once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!” He
Enter Input : suddenly clutched his head in both hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother’s help or without?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I
Enter Input : can’t speak properly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You were bold enough then. You said ‘everything was lawful,’ and how
Enter Input : frightened you are now,” Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. “Won’t you have
Enter Input : some lemonade? I’ll ask for some at once. It’s very refreshing. Only I
Enter Input : must hide this first.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up and call
Enter Input : at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them,
Enter Input : but, looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see
Enter Input : them, he first took out his handkerchief, and as it turned out to be very
Enter Input : dirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on
Enter Input : the table, and put it over the notes. The book was _The Sayings of the
Enter Input : Holy Father Isaac the Syrian_. Ivan read it mechanically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t have any lemonade,” he said. “Talk of me later. Sit down and tell
Enter Input : me how you did it. Tell me all about it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better take off your greatcoat, or you’ll be too hot.” Ivan, as
Enter Input : though he’d only just thought of it, took off his coat, and, without
Enter Input : getting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Speak, please, speak.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell him
Enter Input : _all_ about it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How it was done?” sighed Smerdyakov. “It was done in a most natural way,
Enter Input : following your very words.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of my words later,” Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete
Enter Input : self-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting as before.
Enter Input : “Only tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as it happened. Don’t
Enter Input : forget anything. The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d gone away, then I fell into the cellar.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In a fit or in a sham one?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down the steps to
Enter Input : the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a scream,
Enter Input : and struggled, till they carried me out.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the hospital?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me to the
Enter Input : hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than I’ve had for
Enter Input : years. For two days I was quite unconscious.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right, all right. Go on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They laid me on the bed. I knew I’d be the other side of the partition,
Enter Input : for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there, near them.
Enter Input : She’s always been very kind to me, from my birth up. At night I moaned,
Enter Input : but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Expecting him? To come to you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I’d no doubt that
Enter Input : he’d come that night, for being without me and getting no news, he’d be
Enter Input : sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used to, and do something.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And if he hadn’t come?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then nothing would have happened. I should never have brought myself to
Enter Input : it without him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don’t hurry; above all,
Enter Input : don’t leave anything out!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain, for
Enter Input : I had prepared him for it ... during the last few days.... He knew about
Enter Input : the knocks, that was the chief thing. With his suspiciousness and the fury
Enter Input : which had been growing in him all those days, he was bound to get into the
Enter Input : house by means of those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expecting
Enter Input : him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay,” Ivan interrupted; “if he had killed him, he would have taken the
Enter Input : money and carried it away; you must have considered that. What would you
Enter Input : have got by it afterwards? I don’t see.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he would never have found the money. That was only what I told him,
Enter Input : that the money was under the mattress. But that wasn’t true. It had been
Enter Input : lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was
Enter Input : the only person he trusted, to hide the envelope with the notes in the
Enter Input : corner behind the ikons, for no one would have guessed that place,
Enter Input : especially if they came in a hurry. So that’s where the envelope lay, in
Enter Input : the corner behind the ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it under
Enter Input : the mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was
Enter Input : under the mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : had committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have run away
Enter Input : in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or he
Enter Input : would have been arrested. So I could always have clambered up to the ikons
Enter Input : and have taken away the money next morning or even that night, and it
Enter Input : would have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon
Enter Input : that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take the
Enter Input : money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he would
Enter Input : beat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then I’d
Enter Input : make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : who had taken the money after beating him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him;
Enter Input : you only took the money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, he didn’t kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now that he
Enter Input : was the murderer.... But I don’t want to lie to you now, because ...
Enter Input : because if you really haven’t understood till now, as I see for myself,
Enter Input : and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face,
Enter Input : you are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the murder and
Enter Input : charged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it. And so I want to
Enter Input : prove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the
Enter Input : whole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You
Enter Input : are the rightful murderer.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!” Ivan cried, unable to restrain
Enter Input : himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself
Enter Input : till the end of the conversation. “You still mean that Tchermashnya? Stay,
Enter Input : tell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took Tchermashnya for
Enter Input : consent? How will you explain that now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn’t have made
Enter Input : an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if I’d been
Enter Input : suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice; on the
Enter Input : contrary, you would have protected me from others.... And when you got
Enter Input : your inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all the
Enter Input : rest of your life. For you’d have received your inheritance through me,
Enter Input : seeing that if he had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn’t have had
Enter Input : a farthing.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,” snarled Ivan.
Enter Input : “And what if I hadn’t gone away then, but had informed against you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to Tchermashnya?
Enter Input : That’s all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you would either have
Enter Input : gone away or have stayed. If you had stayed, nothing would have happened.
Enter Input : I should have known that you didn’t want it done, and should have
Enter Input : attempted nothing. As you went away, it meant you assured me that you
Enter Input : wouldn’t dare to inform against me at the trial, and that you’d overlook
Enter Input : my having the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn’t have prosecuted me
Enter Input : afterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court; that is,
Enter Input : not that I had stolen the money or killed him—I shouldn’t have said
Enter Input : that—but that you’d put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didn’t
Enter Input : consent to it. That’s why I needed your consent, so that you couldn’t have
Enter Input : cornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have had? I could always
Enter Input : have cornered you, revealing your eagerness for your father’s death, and I
Enter Input : tell you the public would have believed it all, and you would have been
Enter Input : ashamed for the rest of your life.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Was I then so eager, was I?” Ivan snarled again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doing
Enter Input : it.” Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He was very weak and spoke
Enter Input : slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him on. He evidently
Enter Input : had some design. Ivan felt that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Go on,” he said. “Tell me what happened that night.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard the master
Enter Input : shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came
Enter Input : out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence and darkness.
Enter Input : I lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldn’t bear it. I got up at
Enter Input : last, went out. I saw the window open on the left into the garden, and I
Enter Input : stepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and I
Enter Input : heard the master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. ‘Ech!’ I
Enter Input : thought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, ‘It’s I.’ And he
Enter Input : shouted to me, ‘He’s been, he’s been; he’s run away.’ He meant Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch had been. ‘He’s killed Grigory!’ ‘Where?’ I whispered.
Enter Input : ‘There, in the corner,’ he pointed. He was whispering, too. ‘Wait a bit,’
Enter Input : I said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and there I came upon
Enter Input : Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless. So
Enter Input : it’s true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that
Enter Input : came into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, as
Enter Input : Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, as
Enter Input : he lay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake
Enter Input : up. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came over
Enter Input : me, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master
Enter Input : and said, ‘She’s here, she’s come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants
Enter Input : to be let in.’ And he started like a baby. ‘Where is she?’ he fairly
Enter Input : gasped, but couldn’t believe it. ‘She’s standing there,’ said I. ‘Open.’
Enter Input : He looked out of the window at me, half believing and half distrustful,
Enter Input : but afraid to open. ‘Why, he is afraid of me now,’ I thought. And it was
Enter Input : funny. I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we’d agreed
Enter Input : upon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his
Enter Input : eyes. He didn’t seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps,
Enter Input : he ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but
Enter Input : he stood in the way to prevent me passing. ‘Where is she? Where is she?’
Enter Input : He looked at me, all of a tremble. ‘Well,’ thought I, ‘if he’s so
Enter Input : frightened of me as all that, it’s a bad look out!’ And my legs went weak
Enter Input : with fright that he wouldn’t let me in or would call out, or Marfa
Enter Input : Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might happen. I don’t remember
Enter Input : now, but I must have stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, ‘Why,
Enter Input : she’s there, there, under the window; how is it you don’t see her?’ I
Enter Input : said. ‘Bring her then, bring her.’ ‘She’s afraid,’ said I; ‘she was
Enter Input : frightened at the noise, she’s hidden in the bushes; go and call to her
Enter Input : yourself from the study.’ He ran to the window, put the candle in the
Enter Input : window. ‘Grushenka,’ he cried, ‘Grushenka, are you here?’ Though he cried
Enter Input : that, he didn’t want to lean out of the window, he didn’t want to move
Enter Input : away from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn’t
Enter Input : dare to turn his back on me. ‘Why, here she is,’ said I. I went up to the
Enter Input : window and leaned right out of it. ‘Here she is; she’s in the bush,
Enter Input : laughing at you, don’t you see her?’ He suddenly believed it; he was all
Enter Input : of a shake—he was awfully crazy about her—and he leaned right out of the
Enter Input : window. I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table; do you
Enter Input : remember, weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top
Enter Input : of the skull with the corner of it. He didn’t even cry out. He only sank
Enter Input : down suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I
Enter Input : knew I’d broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face upwards,
Enter Input : covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on me, not a spot.
Enter Input : I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up to the ikons, took the
Enter Input : money out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on the floor and the
Enter Input : pink ribbon beside it. I went out into the garden all of a tremble,
Enter Input : straight to the apple-tree with a hollow in it—you know that hollow. I’d
Enter Input : marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I
Enter Input : wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And
Enter Input : there it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out
Enter Input : of the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, ‘If Grigory
Enter Input : Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me, but if
Enter Input : he is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he’ll bear
Enter Input : witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he must have killed
Enter Input : him and taken the money.’ Then I began groaning with suspense and
Enter Input : impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last
Enter Input : she got up and she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch
Enter Input : was not there, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And that
Enter Input : set it all going and set my mind at rest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without
Enter Input : stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov
Enter Input : glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept his eyes
Enter Input : averted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated and was breathing
Enter Input : hard. The perspiration stood out on his face. But it was impossible to
Enter Input : tell whether it was remorse he was feeling, or what.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay,” cried Ivan, pondering. “What about the door? If he only opened the
Enter Input : door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before? For Grigory saw
Enter Input : it before you went.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone, not
Enter Input : angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment and
Enter Input : peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded that they were
Enter Input : talking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch’s having seen it open, that’s
Enter Input : only his fancy,” said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. “He is not a man, I
Enter Input : assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn’t see it, but fancied he had
Enter Input : seen it, and there’s no shaking him. It’s just our luck he took that
Enter Input : notion into his head, for they can’t fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Enter Input : after that.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen ...” said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making an
Enter Input : effort to grasp something. “Listen. There are a lot of questions I want to
Enter Input : ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.
Enter Input : Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and leave it
Enter Input : there on the floor? Why didn’t you simply carry off the envelope?... When
Enter Input : you were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the
Enter Input : right thing to do ... but why, I can’t understand....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about it, as I
Enter Input : did for instance, if he’d seen those notes before, and perhaps had put
Enter Input : them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up and
Enter Input : addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done the murder, what
Enter Input : should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards, especially in such
Enter Input : desperate haste, since he’d know for certain the notes must be in the
Enter Input : envelope? No, if the robber had been some one like me, he’d simply have
Enter Input : put the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he
Enter Input : could. But it’d be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew
Enter Input : about the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he’d found it,
Enter Input : for instance, under the mattress, he’d have torn it open as quickly as
Enter Input : possible to make sure the notes were in it. And he’d have thrown the
Enter Input : envelope down, without having time to think that it would be evidence
Enter Input : against him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had never directly
Enter Input : stolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born, and if he did bring
Enter Input : himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking what
Enter Input : was his own, for he’d told the whole town he meant to before, and had even
Enter Input : bragged aloud before every one that he’d go and take his property from
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch. I didn’t say that openly to the prosecutor when I was
Enter Input : being examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as
Enter Input : though I didn’t see it myself, and as though he’d thought of it himself
Enter Input : and I hadn’t prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor’s mouth positively
Enter Input : watered at my suggestion.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?” cried Ivan,
Enter Input : overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry? It
Enter Input : was all thought out beforehand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!” Ivan cried again. “No, you
Enter Input : are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was in terrible
Enter Input : distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room to
Enter Input : pass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stood
Enter Input : and sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, as
Enter Input : he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don’t you understand that
Enter Input : if I haven’t killed you, it’s simply because I am keeping you to answer
Enter Input : to-morrow at the trial. God sees,” Ivan raised his hand, “perhaps I, too,
Enter Input : was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father’s ...
Enter Input : death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn’t
Enter Input : urge you on at all. No, no, I didn’t urge you on! But no matter, I will
Enter Input : give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial. I’m determined to! I
Enter Input : shall tell everything, everything. But we’ll make our appearance together.
Enter Input : And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you
Enter Input : give, I’ll face it; I am not afraid of you. I’ll confirm it all myself!
Enter Input : But you must confess, too! You must, you must; we’ll go together. That’s
Enter Input : how it shall be!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it
Enter Input : could be seen that it would be so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,” Smerdyakov
Enter Input : commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We’ll go together,” Ivan repeated. “And if you won’t go, no matter, I’ll
Enter Input : go alone.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’ll be nothing of the sort, and you won’t go,” he concluded at last
Enter Input : positively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t understand me,” Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what’s more, it
Enter Input : will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never said
Enter Input : anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it looks
Enter Input : like it, too), or that you’re so sorry for your brother that you are
Enter Input : sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me, for
Enter Input : you’ve always thought no more of me than if I’d been a fly. And who will
Enter Input : believe you, and what single proof have you got?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Take that money away with you,” Smerdyakov sighed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you
Enter Input : committed the murder for the sake of it?” Ivan looked at him with great
Enter Input : surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want it,” Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a
Enter Input : gesture of refusal. “I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that
Enter Input : money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chiefly
Enter Input : because ‘all things are lawful.’ That was quite right what you taught me,
Enter Input : for you talked a lot to me about that. For if there’s no everlasting God,
Enter Input : there’s no such thing as virtue, and there’s no need of it. You were right
Enter Input : there. So that’s how I looked at it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you come to that of yourself?” asked Ivan, with a wry smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With your guidance.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back the
Enter Input : money?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t believe,” whispered Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then why are you giving it back?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Leave off ... that’s enough!” Smerdyakov waved his hand again. “You used
Enter Input : to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so upset,
Enter Input : too? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself.... Only
Enter Input : there’ll be nothing of the sort! You won’t go to give evidence,”
Enter Input : Smerdyakov decided with conviction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll see,” said Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It isn’t possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I know
Enter Input : that. You like to be respected, too, for you’re very proud; you are far
Enter Input : too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living in
Enter Input : undisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any one—that’s what you
Enter Input : care most about. You won’t want to spoil your life for ever by taking such
Enter Input : a disgrace on yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like
Enter Input : him than any of his children; you’ve the same soul as he had.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are not a fool,” said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to his
Enter Input : face. “You are serious now!” he observed, looking suddenly at Smerdyakov
Enter Input : with a different expression.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the money.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without
Enter Input : wrapping them in anything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall show them at the court to-morrow,” he said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nobody will believe you, as you’ve plenty of money of your own; you may
Enter Input : simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan rose from his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I repeat,” he said, “the only reason I haven’t killed you is that I need
Enter Input : you for to-morrow, remember that, don’t forget it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, kill me. Kill me now,” Smerdyakov said, all at once looking
Enter Input : strangely at Ivan. “You won’t dare do that even!” he added, with a bitter
Enter Input : smile. “You won’t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Till to-morrow,” cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at them
Enter Input : for ten seconds.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, you can go,” he said, with a wave of his hand. “Ivan Fyodorovitch!”
Enter Input : he called after him again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you want?” Ivan turned without stopping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Good-by!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Till to-morrow!” Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, but
Enter Input : suddenly began staggering. “It’s something physical,” he thought with a
Enter Input : grin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was conscious
Enter Input : of unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering that had so
Enter Input : tortured him of late. His determination was taken, “and now it will not be
Enter Input : changed,” he thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against
Enter Input : something and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feet
Enter Input : the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless. The
Enter Input : snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized him and lifted him in his
Enter Input : arms. Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up, knocked
Enter Input : at the shutters, and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him
Enter Input : carry the peasant to the police-station, promising him three roubles. The
Enter Input : man got ready and came out. I won’t describe in detail how Ivan succeeded
Enter Input : in his object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging
Enter Input : for a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the
Enter Input : expenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan
Enter Input : was well content with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,” he reflected
Enter Input : with satisfaction, “I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after
Enter Input : the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his being
Enter Input : frozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,” he thought at
Enter Input : the same instant, with still greater satisfaction, “although they have
Enter Input : decided that I am going out of my mind!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself suddenly
Enter Input : hadn’t he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything. He
Enter Input : decided the question by turning back to the house. “Everything together
Enter Input : to-morrow!” he whispered to himself, and, strange to say, almost all his
Enter Input : gladness and self-satisfaction passed in one instant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his
Enter Input : heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of something
Enter Input : agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and had
Enter Input : been there before. He sank wearily on his sofa. The old woman brought him
Enter Input : a samovar; he made tea, but did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt
Enter Input : giddy. He felt that he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop
Enter Input : asleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his
Enter Input : drowsiness. At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness
Enter Input : that he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round, as
Enter Input : though searching for something. This happened several times. At last his
Enter Input : eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush
Enter Input : suffused his face. He sat a long time in his place, his head propped on
Enter Input : both arms, though he looked sideways at the same point, at the sofa that
Enter Input : stood against the opposite wall. There was evidently something, some
Enter Input : object, that irritated him there, worried him and tormented him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivan’s Nightmare
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must
Enter Input : inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan’s illness.
Enter Input : Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment on
Enter Input : the very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long been
Enter Input : affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the
Enter Input : end gained complete mastery over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I
Enter Input : venture to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible
Enter Input : effort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of
Enter Input : course, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he loathed
Enter Input : the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis in
Enter Input : his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him, to say what he
Enter Input : had to say boldly and resolutely and “to justify himself to himself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from
Enter Input : Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna’s to which I have
Enter Input : referred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor came
Enter Input : to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the
Enter Input : brain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had
Enter Input : reluctantly made him. “Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,”
Enter Input : the doctor opined, “though it would be better to verify them ... you must
Enter Input : take steps at once, without a moment’s delay, or things will go badly with
Enter Input : you.” But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to
Enter Input : his bed to be nursed. “I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I
Enter Input : drop, it’ll be different then, any one may nurse me who likes,” he
Enter Input : decided, dismissing the subject.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as I
Enter Input : have said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa against
Enter Input : the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodness
Enter Input : knows how he had come in, for he had not been in the room when Ivan came
Enter Input : into it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more
Enter Input : accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer
Enter Input : young, _qui faisait la cinquantaine_, as the French say, with rather long,
Enter Input : still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed
Enter Input : beard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently
Enter Input : made by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,
Enter Input : that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two
Enter Input : years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are
Enter Input : worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his
Enter Input : linen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare. The
Enter Input : visitor’s check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light in
Enter Input : color and too tight for the present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat was
Enter Input : out of keeping with the season.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. It
Enter Input : looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners
Enter Input : who used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had unmistakably been, at
Enter Input : some time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections,
Enter Input : had possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming
Enter Input : gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the
Enter Input : position of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old
Enter Input : friend to another and received by them for his companionable and
Enter Input : accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could
Enter Input : be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place of
Enter Input : honor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who
Enter Input : can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion
Enter Input : for any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary
Enter Input : creatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but
Enter Input : if so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some
Enter Input : aunt’s, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming
Enter Input : ashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children
Enter Input : altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas
Enter Input : letter from them and sometimes even answer it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, as
Enter Input : accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might
Enter Input : arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black
Enter Input : ribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring
Enter Input : with a cheap opal stone in it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The visitor
Enter Input : waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his
Enter Input : room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeing
Enter Input : that his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was ready for any
Enter Input : affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it. All at once his
Enter Input : face expressed a sudden solicitude.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say,” he began to Ivan, “excuse me, I only mention it to remind you.
Enter Input : You went to Smerdyakov’s to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you came
Enter Input : away without finding out anything about her, you probably forgot—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, yes,” broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. “Yes,
Enter Input : I’d forgotten ... but it doesn’t matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,”
Enter Input : he muttered to himself, “and you,” he added, addressing his visitor, “I
Enter Input : should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was
Enter Input : tormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you
Enter Input : prompted me, and that I didn’t remember it of myself?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t believe it then,” said the gentleman, smiling amicably, “what’s the
Enter Input : good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to
Enter Input : believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he saw
Enter Input : Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look at the
Enter Input : spiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them ... only fancy,
Enter Input : they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because the
Enter Input : devils show them their horns from the other world. That, they say, is a
Enter Input : material proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world. The other
Enter Input : world and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does
Enter Input : proving there’s a devil prove that there’s a God? I want to join an
Enter Input : idealist society, I’ll lead the opposition in it, I’ll say I am a realist,
Enter Input : but not a materialist, he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen,” Ivan suddenly got up from the table. “I seem to be delirious....
Enter Input : I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I don’t care! You
Enter Input : won’t drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehow
Enter Input : ashamed.... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes don’t see you
Enter Input : and don’t even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess what
Enter Input : you are prating, for it’s I, _I myself speaking, not you_. Only I don’t
Enter Input : know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I’ll
Enter Input : wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you’ll vanish into air.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a
Enter Input : wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,” the visitor began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fool,” laughed Ivan, “do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you?
Enter Input : I am in good spirits now, though I’ve a pain in my forehead ... and in the
Enter Input : top of my head ... only please don’t talk philosophy, as you did last
Enter Input : time. If you can’t take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk
Enter Input : gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What a
Enter Input : nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I’ll get the better of you.
Enter Input : I won’t be taken to a mad-house!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_C’est charmant_, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what
Enter Input : am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you and
Enter Input : am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for
Enter Input : something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring last
Enter Input : time—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,” Ivan cried with a
Enter Input : sort of fury. “You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. It’s
Enter Input : only that I don’t know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a
Enter Input : time. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, but
Enter Input : only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the
Enter Input : nastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of
Enter Input : interest to me, if only I had time to waste on you—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Excuse me, excuse me, I’ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under
Enter Input : the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him, ‘You learnt it from _him_!
Enter Input : How do you know that _he_ visits me?’ you were thinking of me then. So for
Enter Input : one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,” the gentleman
Enter Input : laughed blandly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn’t believe in you. I
Enter Input : don’t know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only
Enter Input : dreaming then and didn’t see you really at all—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I’ve
Enter Input : treated him badly over Father Zossima.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!” Ivan laughed again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You scold me, but you laugh—that’s a good sign. But you are ever so much
Enter Input : more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution
Enter Input : of yours—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t speak of my resolution,” cried Ivan, savagely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand, I understand, _c’est noble, c’est charmant_, you are going
Enter Input : to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _C’est
Enter Input : chevaleresque_.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold your tongue, I’ll kick you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shan’t be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained. If you
Enter Input : kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don’t kick ghosts.
Enter Input : Joking apart, it doesn’t matter to me, scold if you like, though it’s
Enter Input : better to be a trifle more polite even to me. ‘Fool, flunkey!’ what
Enter Input : words!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Scolding you, I scold myself,” Ivan laughed again, “you are myself,
Enter Input : myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am thinking ...
Enter Input : and are incapable of saying anything new!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If I am like you in my way of thinking, it’s all to my credit,” the
Enter Input : gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what’s more, the stupid ones.
Enter Input : You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I can’t put up with
Enter Input : you! What am I to do, what am I to do?” Ivan said through his clenched
Enter Input : teeth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to
Enter Input : be recognized as such,” the visitor began in an excess of deprecating and
Enter Input : simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. “I am poor, but ... I
Enter Input : won’t say very honest, but ... it’s an axiom generally accepted in society
Enter Input : that I am a fallen angel. I certainly can’t conceive how I can ever have
Enter Input : been an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that there’s
Enter Input : no harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a
Enter Input : gentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I
Enter Input : love men genuinely, I’ve been greatly calumniated! Here when I stay with
Enter Input : you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and that’s what I
Enter Input : like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I
Enter Input : love the realism of earth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed,
Enter Input : here all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but
Enter Input : indeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming.
Enter Input : Besides, on earth I become superstitious. Please don’t laugh, that’s just
Enter Input : what I like, to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I’ve
Enter Input : grown fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go
Enter Input : and steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becoming
Enter Input : incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant’s wife
Enter Input : weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she believes. My ideal is to
Enter Input : go to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it
Enter Input : is. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like being doctored
Enter Input : too; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was
Enter Input : vaccinated in a foundling hospital—if only you knew how I enjoyed myself
Enter Input : that day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But you
Enter Input : are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this evening? I
Enter Input : know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well, what about your health?
Enter Input : What did the doctor say?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fool!” Ivan snapped out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn’t ask out of
Enter Input : sympathy. You needn’t answer. Now rheumatism has come in again—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fool!” repeated Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism
Enter Input : last year that I remember it to this day.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil have rheumatism!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form and I
Enter Input : take the consequences. Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto_.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... that’s not bad for the
Enter Input : devil!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am glad I’ve pleased you at last.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you didn’t get that from me.” Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.
Enter Input : “That never entered my head, that’s strange.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_C’est du nouveau, n’est-ce pas?_ This time I’ll act honestly and explain
Enter Input : to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestion
Enter Input : or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and
Enter Input : real actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such
Enter Input : a plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the
Enter Input : last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such
Enter Input : dreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people,
Enter Input : officials, journalists, priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A
Enter Input : statesman confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him
Enter Input : when he was asleep. Well, that’s how it is now, though I am your
Enter Input : hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which had
Enter Input : not entered your head before. So I don’t repeat your ideas, yet I am only
Enter Input : your nightmare, nothing more.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my
Enter Input : nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear fellow, I’ve adopted a special method to-day, I’ll explain it to
Enter Input : you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I caught cold then,
Enter Input : only not here but yonder.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can’t you go away?” Ivan
Enter Input : exclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat down on the
Enter Input : sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in both
Enter Input : hands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation. It was
Enter Input : evidently of no use.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your nerves are out of order,” observed the gentleman, with a carelessly
Enter Input : easy, though perfectly polite, air. “You are angry with me even for being
Enter Input : able to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way. I was
Enter Input : hurrying then to a diplomatic _soirée_ at the house of a lady of high rank
Enter Input : in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry. Well, an
Enter Input : evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows where and had to
Enter Input : fly through space to reach your earth.... Of course, it took only an
Enter Input : instant, but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight
Enter Input : minutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat. Spirits don’t
Enter Input : freeze, but when one’s in fleshly form, well ... in brief, I didn’t think,
Enter Input : and set off, and you know in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is
Enter Input : above the firmament, there’s such a frost ... at least one can’t call it
Enter Input : frost, you can fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the
Enter Input : village girls play—they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees
Enter Input : of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin
Enter Input : off, so it bleeds. But that’s only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagine
Enter Input : it would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it would be the end of
Enter Input : it ... if only there could be an ax there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And can there be an ax there?” Ivan interrupted, carelessly and
Enter Input : disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the
Enter Input : delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An ax?” the guest interrupted in surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, what would become of an ax there?” Ivan cried suddenly, with a sort
Enter Input : of savage and insistent obstinacy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What would become of an ax in space? _Quelle idée!_ If it were to fall to
Enter Input : any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth without
Enter Input : knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would calculate the rising
Enter Input : and the setting of the ax, _Gatzuk_ would put it in his calendar, that’s
Enter Input : all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are stupid, awfully stupid,” said Ivan peevishly. “Fib more cleverly
Enter Input : or I won’t listen. You want to get the better of me by realism, to
Enter Input : convince me that you exist, but I don’t want to believe you exist! I won’t
Enter Input : believe it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I am not fibbing, it’s all the truth; the truth is unhappily hardly
Enter Input : ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big of me, and
Enter Input : perhaps something fine. That’s a great pity, for I only give what I can—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t talk philosophy, you ass!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning and
Enter Input : groaning. I’ve tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnose
Enter Input : beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips, but
Enter Input : they’ve no idea how to cure you. There was an enthusiastic little student
Enter Input : here, ‘You may die,’ said he, ‘but you’ll know perfectly what disease you
Enter Input : are dying of!’ And then what a way they have sending people to
Enter Input : specialists! ‘We only diagnose,’ they say, ‘but go to such-and-such a
Enter Input : specialist, he’ll cure you.’ The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of
Enter Input : disease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are only
Enter Input : specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong
Enter Input : with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European
Enter Input : specialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris, he’ll look at your nose; I
Enter Input : can only cure your right nostril, he’ll tell you, for I don’t cure the
Enter Input : left nostril, that’s not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there’s a
Enter Input : specialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I fell
Enter Input : back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub myself with
Enter Input : honey and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an extra bath I went,
Enter Input : smeared myself all over and it did me no good at all. In despair I wrote
Enter Input : to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a book and some drops, bless him,
Enter Input : and, only fancy, Hoff’s malt extract cured me! I bought it by accident,
Enter Input : drank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took it away
Enter Input : completely. I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was
Enter Input : prompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a
Enter Input : bother: not a single paper would take my letter. ‘It would be very
Enter Input : reactionary,’ they said, ‘no one will believe it. _Le diable n’existe
Enter Input : point._ You’d better remain anonymous,’ they advised me. What use is a
Enter Input : letter of thanks if it’s anonymous? I laughed with the men at the
Enter Input : newspaper office; ‘It’s reactionary to believe in God in our days,’ I
Enter Input : said, ‘but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.’ ‘We quite understand
Enter Input : that,’ they said. ‘Who doesn’t believe in the devil? Yet it won’t do, it
Enter Input : might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.’ But I thought as a
Enter Input : joke it wouldn’t be very witty. So it wasn’t printed. And do you know, I
Enter Input : have felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, for
Enter Input : instance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Philosophical reflections again?” Ivan snarled malignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God preserve me from it, but one can’t help complaining sometimes. I am a
Enter Input : slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can see
Enter Input : you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn’t the only thing! I have
Enter Input : naturally a kind and merry heart. ‘I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.’
Enter Input : You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more
Enter Input : serious one. Before time was, by some decree which I could never make out,
Enter Input : I was pre-destined ‘to deny’ and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not
Enter Input : at all inclined to negation. ‘No, you must go and deny, without denial
Enter Input : there’s no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of
Enter Input : criticism?’ Without criticism it would be nothing but one ‘hosannah.’ But
Enter Input : nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried in
Enter Input : the crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style. But I don’t meddle in
Enter Input : that, I didn’t create it, I am not answerable for it. Well, they’ve chosen
Enter Input : their scapegoat, they’ve made me write the column of criticism and so life
Enter Input : was made possible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask
Enter Input : for annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there’d be nothing without you.
Enter Input : If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen. There
Enter Input : would be no events without you, and there must be events. So against the
Enter Input : grain I serve to produce events and do what’s irrational because I am
Enter Input : commanded to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farce
Enter Input : as something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course
Enter Input : ... but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for
Enter Input : suffering is life. Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It
Enter Input : would be transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but
Enter Input : tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don’t live. I am x in
Enter Input : an indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all
Enter Input : beginning and end, and who has even forgotten his own name. You are
Enter Input : laughing— no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. You are for ever
Enter Input : angry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that I would
Enter Input : give away all this super-stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply to
Enter Input : be transformed into the soul of a merchant’s wife weighing eighteen stone
Enter Input : and set candles at God’s shrine.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then even you don’t believe in God?” said Ivan, with a smile of hatred.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What can I say?—that is, if you are in earnest—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is there a God or not?” Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don’t know.
Enter Input : There! I’ve said it now!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You don’t know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you are
Enter Input : myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true.
Enter Input : _Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest, all these
Enter Input : worlds, God and even Satan—all that is not proved, to my mind. Does all
Enter Input : that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical
Enter Input : development of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make haste
Enter Input : to stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’d better tell me some anecdote!” said Ivan miserably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an
Enter Input : anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you don’t
Enter Input : believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are all
Enter Input : in a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there used
Enter Input : to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung together
Enter Input : somehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since we’ve
Enter Input : learned that you’ve discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and
Enter Input : the devil knows what, we had to lower our crest. There’s a regular muddle,
Enter Input : and, above all, superstition, scandal; there’s as much scandal among us as
Enter Input : among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for we
Enter Input : have our secret police department where private information is received.
Enter Input : Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages—not yours, but ours—and
Enter Input : no one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen stone,
Enter Input : not your old ladies I mean, but ours. We’ve everything you have, I am
Enter Input : revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you; though it’s
Enter Input : forbidden. This legend is about Paradise. There was, they say, here on
Enter Input : earth a thinker and philosopher. He rejected everything, ‘laws,
Enter Input : conscience, faith,’ and, above all, the future life. He died; he expected
Enter Input : to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before
Enter Input : him. He was astounded and indignant. ‘This is against my principles!’ he
Enter Input : said. And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me, I am
Enter Input : just repeating what I heard myself, it’s only a legend ... he was
Enter Input : sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we’ve adopted the
Enter Input : metric system, you know) and when he has finished that quadrillion, the
Enter Input : gates of heaven would be opened to him and he’ll be forgiven—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion
Enter Input : kilometers?” asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What tortures? Ah, don’t ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now they
Enter Input : have taken chiefly to moral punishments—‘the stings of conscience’ and all
Enter Input : that nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of your
Enter Input : manners. And who’s the better for it? Only those who have got no
Enter Input : conscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have
Enter Input : none? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor suffer
Enter Input : for it. Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them,
Enter Input : especially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but
Enter Input : mischief! The ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned
Enter Input : to the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down
Enter Input : across the road. ‘I won’t go, I refuse on principle!’ Take the soul of an
Enter Input : enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah,
Enter Input : who sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and you
Enter Input : get the character of that thinker who lay across the road.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did he lie on there?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not laughing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo!” cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he was
Enter Input : listening with an unexpected curiosity. “Well, is he lying there now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s the point, that he isn’t. He lay there almost a thousand years and
Enter Input : then he got up and went on.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What an ass!” cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming to be
Enter Input : pondering something intently. “Does it make any difference whether he lies
Enter Input : there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take a
Enter Input : billion years to walk it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Much more than that. I haven’t got a pencil and paper or I could work it
Enter Input : out. But he got there long ago, and that’s where the story begins.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present earth may
Enter Input : have been repeated a billion times. Why, it’s become extinct, been frozen;
Enter Input : cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again ‘the water
Enter Input : above the firmament,’ then again a comet, again a sun, again from the sun
Enter Input : it becomes earth—and the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly
Enter Input : and exactly the same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably
Enter Input : tedious—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, well, what happened when he arrived?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked in, before
Enter Input : he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to my thinking his
Enter Input : watch must have long dissolved into its elements on the way), he cried out
Enter Input : that those two seconds were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometers but
Enter Input : a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the quadrillionth power! In fact,
Enter Input : he sang ‘hosannah’ and overdid it so, that some persons there of lofty
Enter Input : ideas wouldn’t shake hands with him at first—he’d become too rapidly
Enter Input : reactionary, they said. The Russian temperament. I repeat, it’s a legend.
Enter Input : I give it for what it’s worth. So that’s the sort of ideas we have on such
Enter Input : subjects even now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ve caught you!” Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight, as though
Enter Input : he had succeeded in remembering something at last. “That anecdote about
Enter Input : the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen then, I was at
Enter Input : the high school. I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow
Enter Input : called Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic
Enter Input : that I couldn’t have taken it from anywhere. I thought I’d forgotten it
Enter Input : ... but I’ve unconsciously recalled it—I recalled it myself—it was not you
Enter Input : telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that
Enter Input : even when people are being taken to execution ... it’s come back to me in
Enter Input : a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream, not a living creature!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,” laughed the
Enter Input : gentleman, “I am convinced that you believe in me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not in the slightest! I haven’t a hundredth part of a grain of faith in
Enter Input : you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses perhaps are the
Enter Input : strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the ten-thousandth of a
Enter Input : grain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not for one minute,” cried Ivan furiously. “But I should like to believe
Enter Input : in you,” he added strangely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Aha! There’s an admission! But I am good-natured. I’ll come to your
Enter Input : assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me. I told you your
Enter Input : anecdote you’d forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in me
Enter Input : completely.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of your
Enter Input : existence!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
Enter Input : disbelief—is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as you
Enter Input : are, that it’s better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you are
Enter Input : inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling you
Enter Input : that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and I have my
Enter Input : motive in it. It’s the new method. As soon as you disbelieve in me
Enter Input : completely, you’ll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but
Enter Input : a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained my object, which is an
Enter Input : honorable one. I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will
Enter Input : grow into an oak-tree—and such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will
Enter Input : long to enter the ranks of ‘the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly
Enter Input : women,’ for that is what you are secretly longing for. You’ll dine on
Enter Input : locusts, you’ll wander into the wilderness to save your soul!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then it’s for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, you
Enter Input : scoundrel?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you are!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed
Enter Input : seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear fellow, I’ve done nothing else. One forgets the whole world and
Enter Input : all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he is a very
Enter Input : precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes worth a whole
Enter Input : constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you know. The conquest is
Enter Input : priceless! And some of them, on my word, are not inferior to you in
Enter Input : culture, though you won’t believe it. They can contemplate such depths of
Enter Input : belief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems
Enter Input : that they are within a hair’s-breadth of being ‘turned upside down,’ as
Enter Input : the actor Gorbunov says.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, did you get your nose pulled?”(8)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear fellow,” observed the visitor sententiously, “it’s better to get
Enter Input : off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an afflicted
Enter Input : marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated by a specialist)
Enter Input : in confession to his spiritual father—a Jesuit. I was present, it was
Enter Input : simply charming. ‘Give me back my nose!’ he said, and he beat his breast.
Enter Input : ‘My son,’ said the priest evasively, ‘all things are accomplished in
Enter Input : accordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and what seems a
Enter Input : misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits.
Enter Input : If stern destiny has deprived you of your nose, it’s to your advantage
Enter Input : that no one can ever pull you by your nose.’ ‘Holy father, that’s no
Enter Input : comfort,’ cried the despairing marquis. ‘I’d be delighted to have my nose
Enter Input : pulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.’ ‘My
Enter Input : son,’ sighs the priest, ‘you can’t expect every blessing at once. This is
Enter Input : murmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, for
Enter Input : if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you’d be glad to have
Enter Input : your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already been
Enter Input : fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by the
Enter Input : nose.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Fool, how stupid!” cried Ivan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that’s the
Enter Input : genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for word as
Enter Input : I’ve told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble. The
Enter Input : unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got home. I was by
Enter Input : his side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit confessionals are really
Enter Input : my most delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Here’s another
Enter Input : incident that happened only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of
Enter Input : twenty—a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth
Enter Input : water—comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her sin into the
Enter Input : grating. ‘Why, my daughter, have you fallen again already?’ cries the
Enter Input : priest. ‘O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not the same man this time, how
Enter Input : long is this going on? Aren’t you ashamed!’ ‘_Ah, mon père_,’ answers the
Enter Input : sinner with tears of penitence, ‘_ça lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi si
Enter Input : peu de peine!_’ Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of
Enter Input : nature, better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on
Enter Input : the spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the
Enter Input : priest at the grating making an appointment with her for the
Enter Input : evening—though he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It
Enter Input : was nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning
Enter Input : up your nose again? Angry again? I don’t know how to please you—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare,”
Enter Input : Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition. “I am bored with
Enter Input : you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give anything to be able to
Enter Input : shake you off!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I repeat, moderate your expectations, don’t demand of me ‘everything
Enter Input : great and noble’ and you’ll see how well we shall get on,” said the
Enter Input : gentleman impressively. “You are really angry with me for not having
Enter Input : appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with scorched
Enter Input : wings, but have shown myself in such a modest form. You are wounded, in
Enter Input : the first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride.
Enter Input : How could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is
Enter Input : that romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can’t
Enter Input : help it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
Enter Input : appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
Enter Input : Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I was
Enter Input : positively afraid of doing it, for you’d have thrashed me for daring to
Enter Input : pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the Polar Star
Enter Input : or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid, but, mercy on us! I
Enter Input : make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence. Mephistopheles declared
Enter Input : to Faust that he desired evil, but did only good. Well, he can say what he
Enter Input : likes, it’s quite the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all
Enter Input : creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good. I was there when
Enter Input : the Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom
Enter Input : the soul of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim
Enter Input : singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim
Enter Input : which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that’s
Enter Input : sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all. The
Enter Input : word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you know
Enter Input : how susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am. But common sense—oh,
Enter Input : a most unhappy trait in my character—kept me in due bounds and I let the
Enter Input : moment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have
Enter Input : happened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been
Enter Input : extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so, solely
Enter Input : from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress the
Enter Input : good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody takes all the credit
Enter Input : of what’s good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me. But
Enter Input : I don’t envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious.
Enter Input : Why am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent
Enter Input : people and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to
Enter Input : take such consequences sometimes? I know, of course, there’s a secret in
Enter Input : it, but they won’t tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps,
Enter Input : seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable
Enter Input : minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme
Enter Input : throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the end of
Enter Input : everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who would take them in?
Enter Input : I know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled. I, too, shall
Enter Input : walk my quadrillion and learn the secret. But till that happens I am
Enter Input : sulking and fulfill my destiny though it’s against the grain—that is, to
Enter Input : ruin thousands for the sake of saving one. How many souls have had to be
Enter Input : ruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that
Enter Input : one righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days!
Enter Input : Yes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for
Enter Input : me—one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the
Enter Input : other my own. And there’s no knowing which will turn out the better....
Enter Input : Are you asleep?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I might well be,” Ivan groaned angrily. “All my stupid ideas—outgrown,
Enter Input : thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass—you present to
Enter Input : me as something new!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by my
Enter Input : literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn’t bad, was it? And
Enter Input : then that ironical tone _à la_ Heine, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a flunkey
Enter Input : like you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russian
Enter Input : gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, the
Enter Input : author of a promising poem entitled _The Grand Inquisitor_. I was only
Enter Input : thinking of him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I forbid you to speak of _The Grand Inquisitor_,” cried Ivan, crimson
Enter Input : with shame.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the _Geological Cataclysm_. Do you remember? That was a poem, now!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hold your tongue, or I’ll kill you!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to
Enter Input : that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quivering
Enter Input : with eagerness for life! ‘There are new men,’ you decided last spring,
Enter Input : when you were meaning to come here, ‘they propose to destroy everything
Enter Input : and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didn’t ask my advice! I
Enter Input : maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the
Enter Input : idea of God in man, that’s how we have to set to work. It’s that, that we
Enter Input : must begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon
Enter Input : as men have all of them denied God—and I believe that period, analogous
Enter Input : with geological periods, will come to pass—the old conception of the
Enter Input : universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what’s more, the
Enter Input : old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from
Enter Input : life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.
Enter Input : Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the
Enter Input : man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature
Enter Input : infinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from
Enter Input : hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of
Enter Input : the joys of heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept
Enter Input : death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it’s
Enter Input : useless for him to repine at life’s being a moment, and he will love his
Enter Input : brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment
Enter Input : of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify
Enter Input : its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the
Enter Input : grave’... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears,
Enter Input : but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such
Enter Input : a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanity
Enter Input : is settled for ever. But as, owing to man’s inveterate stupidity, this
Enter Input : cannot come about for at least a thousand years, every one who recognizes
Enter Input : the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the
Enter Input : new principles. In that sense, ‘all things are lawful’ for him. What’s
Enter Input : more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no
Enter Input : God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if
Enter Input : he is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position,
Enter Input : he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the
Enter Input : old slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands,
Enter Input : the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ...
Enter Input : ‘all things are lawful’ and that’s the end of it! That’s all very
Enter Input : charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for
Enter Input : doing it? But that’s our modern Russian all over. He can’t bring himself
Enter Input : to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence, speaking
Enter Input : louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he did not
Enter Input : succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table and
Enter Input : flung it at the orator.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “_Ah, mais c’est bête enfin_,” cried the latter, jumping up from the sofa
Enter Input : and shaking the drops of tea off himself. “He remembers Luther’s inkstand!
Enter Input : He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It’s like a woman!
Enter Input : I suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan jumped
Enter Input : up from the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you hear? You’d better open,” cried the visitor; “it’s your brother
Enter Input : Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I’ll be bound!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and of
Enter Input : course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings ‘news,’ ” Ivan
Enter Input : exclaimed frantically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Open, open to him. There’s a snowstorm and he is your brother. _Monsieur
Enter Input : sait-il le temps qu’il fait? C’est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors_.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something
Enter Input : seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break his
Enter Input : chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. At
Enter Input : last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked
Enter Input : round him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just
Enter Input : thrown at his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one
Enter Input : on the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on
Enter Input : persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his
Enter Input : dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened just
Enter Input : now!” cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, I told you not to come,” he cried fiercely to his brother. “In
Enter Input : two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,” Alyosha answered from the yard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come round to the steps, I’ll open at once,” said Ivan, going to open the
Enter Input : door to Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter X. “It Was He Who Said That”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya
Enter Input : Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken
Enter Input : his own life. “I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a
Enter Input : nail in the wall.” On Alyosha’s inquiring whether she had informed the
Enter Input : police, she answered that she had told no one, “but I flew straight to
Enter Input : you, I’ve run all the way.” She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported,
Enter Input : and was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he
Enter Input : found Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: “I destroy my
Enter Input : life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.”
Enter Input : Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain
Enter Input : and told him all about it. “And from him I’ve come straight to you,” said
Enter Input : Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan’s face. He had not
Enter Input : taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though struck by
Enter Input : something in his expression.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother,” he cried suddenly, “you must be terribly ill. You look and
Enter Input : don’t seem to understand what I tell you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s a good thing you came,” said Ivan, as though brooding, and not
Enter Input : hearing Alyosha’s exclamation. “I knew he had hanged himself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “From whom?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told me so just
Enter Input : now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same brooding
Enter Input : tone, looking at the ground.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is _he_?” asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s slipped away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a ‘pure cherub.’ Dmitri
Enter Input : calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim.
Enter Input : What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps that
Enter Input : constellation is only a chemical molecule. There’s a constellation of the
Enter Input : Lion and the Sun. Don’t you know it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, sit down,” said Alyosha in alarm. “For goodness’ sake, sit down
Enter Input : on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow, that’s right.
Enter Input : Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps it will do you good.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Give me the towel: it’s here on the chair. I just threw it down there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not here. Don’t worry yourself. I know where it is—here,” said
Enter Input : Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivan’s
Enter Input : dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked strangely at
Enter Input : the towel: recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Stay”—he got up from the sofa—“an hour ago I took that new towel from
Enter Input : there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ...
Enter Input : How is it it’s dry? There was no other.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You put that towel on your head?” asked Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles
Enter Input : burnt down so? What’s the time?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nearly twelve.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, no, no!” Ivan cried suddenly. “It was not a dream. He was here; he
Enter Input : was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw a
Enter Input : glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but this
Enter Input : dream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha
Enter Input : ... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ...
Enter Input : though I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is
Enter Input : frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.” Ivan laughed suddenly
Enter Input : and began pacing about the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?” Alyosha asked anxiously
Enter Input : again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil! He’s taken to visiting me. He’s been here twice, almost three
Enter Input : times. He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not
Enter Input : Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning. But he is not Satan:
Enter Input : that’s a lie. He is an impostor. He is simply a devil—a paltry, trivial
Enter Input : devil. He goes to the baths. If you undressed him, you’d be sure to find
Enter Input : he had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish dog’s, a yard long, dun
Enter Input : color.... Alyosha, you are cold. You’ve been in the snow. Would you like
Enter Input : some tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some? _C’est à ne
Enter Input : pas mettre un chien dehors._...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to sit
Enter Input : down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He sat down beside him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What were you telling me just now about Lise?” Ivan began again. (He was
Enter Input : becoming very talkative.) “I like Lise. I said something nasty about her.
Enter Input : It was a lie. I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more
Enter Input : afraid of her than of anything. On account of the future. She will cast me
Enter Input : off to-morrow and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining
Enter Input : Mitya from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it’s not so.
Enter Input : To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan’t hang myself. Do you
Enter Input : know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it because I am base? I am
Enter Input : not a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that Smerdyakov had
Enter Input : hanged himself? Yes, it was _he_ told me so.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?” asked
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him away. You did
Enter Input : drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I love your face,
Enter Input : Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ is myself, Alyosha.
Enter Input : All that’s base in me, all that’s mean and contemptible. Yes, I am a
Enter Input : romantic. He guessed it ... though it’s a libel. He is frightfully stupid;
Enter Input : but it’s to his advantage. He has cunning, animal cunning—he knew how to
Enter Input : infuriate me. He kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how
Enter Input : he made me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great deal
Enter Input : that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it to
Enter Input : myself. Do you know, Alyosha,” Ivan added in an intensely earnest and
Enter Input : confidential tone, “I should be awfully glad to think that it was _he_ and
Enter Input : not I.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has worn you out,” said Alyosha, looking compassionately at his
Enter Input : brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’s been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so cleverly.
Enter Input : ‘Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why am I
Enter Input : tormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind for the
Enter Input : seven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we shall be gods.’ It was
Enter Input : he said that, it was he said that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And not you, not you?” Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly at
Enter Input : his brother. “Never mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him.
Enter Input : And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,”
Enter Input : Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. “But he was unfair to me, unfair to
Enter Input : me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. ‘Oh, you are
Enter Input : going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your
Enter Input : father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother,” Alyosha interposed, “restrain yourself. It was not you murdered
Enter Input : him. It’s not true!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what he says, he, and he knows it. ‘You are going to perform an
Enter Input : act of heroic virtue, and you don’t believe in virtue; that’s what
Enter Input : tortures you and makes you angry, that’s why you are so vindictive.’ He
Enter Input : said that to me about me and he knows what he says.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s you say that, not he,” exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, “and you say it
Enter Input : because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, he knows what he says. ‘You are going from pride,’ he says. ‘You’ll
Enter Input : stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror?
Enter Input : You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!’ He said
Enter Input : that about me. ‘And do you know you are longing for their praise—“he is a
Enter Input : criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his
Enter Input : brother and he confessed.” ’ That’s a lie, Alyosha!” Ivan cried suddenly,
Enter Input : with flashing eyes. “I don’t want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I
Enter Input : don’t! That’s a lie! That’s why I threw the glass at him and it broke
Enter Input : against his ugly face.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother, calm yourself, stop!” Alyosha entreated him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he knows how to torment one. He’s cruel,” Ivan went on, unheeding.
Enter Input : “I had an inkling from the first what he came for. ‘Granting that you go
Enter Input : through pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and
Enter Input : sent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while you would only be
Enter Input : punished with moral condemnation’ (‘Do you hear?’ he laughed then)—‘and
Enter Input : some people will praise you. But now Smerdyakov’s dead, he has hanged
Enter Input : himself, and who’ll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are
Enter Input : going, you’ll go all the same, you’ve decided to go. What are you going
Enter Input : for now?’ That’s awful, Alyosha. I can’t endure such questions. Who dare
Enter Input : ask me such questions?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Brother,” interposed Alyosha—his heart sank with terror, but he still
Enter Input : seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason—“how could he have told you of
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was no
Enter Input : time for any one to know of it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He told me,” said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. “It was all he
Enter Input : did talk about, if you come to that. ‘And it would be all right if you
Enter Input : believed in virtue,’ he said. ‘No matter if they disbelieve you, you are
Enter Input : going for the sake of principle. But you are a little pig like Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to go
Enter Input : meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you don’t know
Enter Input : yourself why you go! Oh, you’d give a great deal to know yourself why you
Enter Input : go! And can you have made up your mind? You’ve not made up your mind.
Enter Input : You’ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;
Enter Input : you know you’ll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decision
Enter Input : does not depend on you. You’ll go because you won’t dare not to go. Why
Enter Input : won’t you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That’s a riddle for
Enter Input : you!’ He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me a
Enter Input : coward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l’énigme_ is that I am a coward. ‘It is not
Enter Input : for such eagles to soar above the earth.’ It was he added that—he! And
Enter Input : Smerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I’ve seen
Enter Input : that for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! ‘You are going
Enter Input : in order to be praised.’ That’s a brutal lie! And you despise me too,
Enter Input : Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I
Enter Input : hate the monster! I don’t want to save the monster. Let him rot in
Enter Input : Siberia! He’s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow I’ll go, stand before
Enter Input : them, and spit in their faces!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and
Enter Input : down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. “I seem to be
Enter Input : sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.” It seemed to
Enter Input : be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed
Enter Input : through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his
Enter Input : brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees
Enter Input : Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking,
Enter Input : talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his
Enter Input : words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in
Enter Input : time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed
Enter Input : him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two
Enter Input : hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and
Enter Input : evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without
Enter Input : undressing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand
Enter Input : Ivan’s illness. “The anguish of a proud determination. An earnest
Enter Input : conscience!” God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining
Enter Input : mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. “Yes,” the thought
Enter Input : floated through Alyosha’s head as it lay on the pillow, “yes, if
Enter Input : Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan’s evidence; but he will go
Enter Input : and give it.” Alyosha smiled softly. “God will conquer!” he thought. “He
Enter Input : will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he’ll perish in hate,
Enter Input : revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does
Enter Input : not believe in,” Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Book XII. A Judicial Error
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. The Fatal Day
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At ten o’clock in the morning of the day following the events I have
Enter Input : described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable
Enter Input : of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in
Enter Input : the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full
Enter Input : explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I
Enter Input : may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have
Enter Input : selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may
Enter Input : have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall
Enter Input : do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for
Enter Input : himself that I have done all I can.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what
Enter Input : surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was
Enter Input : surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great
Enter Input : interest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to
Enter Input : begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and
Enter Input : surmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too,
Enter Input : that the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not
Enter Input : imagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every
Enter Input : one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident at
Enter Input : the trial this day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, but
Enter Input : from several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and Petersburg.
Enter Input : Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguished
Enter Input : personages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched up. A special
Enter Input : place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the
Enter Input : most distinguished and important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs
Enter Input : had been placed there—something exceptional, which had never been allowed
Enter Input : before. A large proportion—not less than half of the public—were ladies.
Enter Input : There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not
Enter Input : know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since been eagerly
Enter Input : sought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the room, behind the
Enter Input : platform, a special partition hurriedly put up, behind which all these
Enter Input : lawyers were admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standing
Enter Input : room there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space, and the
Enter Input : crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed,
Enter Input : shoulder to shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made their
Enter Input : appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority of the
Enter Input : ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed hysterical,
Enter Input : intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar fact—established afterwards
Enter Input : by many observations—was that almost all the ladies, or, at least the vast
Enter Input : majority of them, were on Mitya’s side and in favor of his being
Enter Input : acquitted. This was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror
Enter Input : of female hearts. It was known that two women rivals were to appear in the
Enter Input : case. One of them—Katerina Ivanovna—was an object of general interest. All
Enter Input : sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes of her
Enter Input : passion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and “aristocratic
Enter Input : connections” were particularly insisted upon (she had called upon scarcely
Enter Input : any one in the town). People said she intended to petition the Government
Enter Input : for leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him
Enter Input : somewhere in the mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited
Enter Input : with no less impatience. The public was looking forward with anxious
Enter Input : curiosity to the meeting of the two rivals—the proud aristocratic girl and
Enter Input : “the hetaira.” But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of
Enter Input : the district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen “the woman who
Enter Input : had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,” and all, almost without
Enter Input : exception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with “such a
Enter Input : very common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that there
Enter Input : were several serious family quarrels on Mitya’s account in our town. Many
Enter Input : ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion
Enter Input : about the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the husbands of
Enter Input : these ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner, should
Enter Input : enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him. In fact, one may say
Enter Input : pretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine,
Enter Input : part of the audience were biased against the prisoner. There were numbers
Enter Input : of severe, frowning, even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to
Enter Input : offend many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,
Enter Input : of course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of
Enter Input : Mitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the majority
Enter Input : of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal,
Enter Input : except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than in
Enter Input : the moral aspect of the case.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first time
Enter Input : he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And if he
Enter Input : defended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over
Enter Input : Russia. There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about the
Enter Input : President of the Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a
Enter Input : tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from the
Enter Input : beginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitive
Enter Input : prosecutor, who always considered that he had been aggrieved by some one
Enter Input : in Petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated, was
Enter Input : keenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of
Enter Input : rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,
Enter Input : was his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutor
Enter Input : was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the
Enter Input : contrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase of danger. It
Enter Input : must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly
Enter Input : impressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case and work at it
Enter Input : as though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result.
Enter Input : This was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this
Enter Input : characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have
Enter Input : been expected from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his
Enter Input : passion for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor
Enter Input : was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed.
Enter Input : But with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset
Enter Input : of his career and had never made up for it later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a humane and
Enter Input : cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressive
Enter Input : views. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself greatly about
Enter Input : his future career. The great aim of his life was to be a man of advanced
Enter Input : ideas. He was, too, a man of connections and property. He felt, as we
Enter Input : learnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a
Enter Input : social, not from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a
Enter Input : social phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product of
Enter Input : our social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on,
Enter Input : and so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic
Enter Input : significance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner, was
Enter Input : rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their
Enter Input : appearance. Our court is the best hall in the town—spacious, lofty, and
Enter Input : good for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on a raised platform,
Enter Input : a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury. On the
Enter Input : left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense. In
Enter Input : the middle of the court, near the judges, was a table with the “material
Enter Input : proofs.” On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch’s white silk dressing-gown, stained
Enter Input : with blood; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been
Enter Input : committed; Mitya’s shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat, stained
Enter Input : with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put his
Enter Input : handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by now quite
Enter Input : yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin’s with a view to suicide,
Enter Input : and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the
Enter Input : envelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for
Enter Input : Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied, and many
Enter Input : other articles I don’t remember. In the body of the hall, at some
Enter Input : distance, came the seats for the public. But in front of the balustrade a
Enter Input : few chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after
Enter Input : giving their evidence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At ten o’clock the three judges arrived—the President, one honorary
Enter Input : justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, entered
Enter Input : immediately after. The President was a short, stout, thick-set man of
Enter Input : fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut short,
Enter Input : and a red ribbon, of what Order I don’t remember. The prosecutor struck me
Enter Input : and the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost green. His face
Enter Input : seemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I
Enter Input : had seen him looking as usual only two days before. The President began
Enter Input : with asking the court whether all the jury were present.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But I see I can’t go on like this, partly because some things I did not
Enter Input : hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most of
Enter Input : all because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space to
Enter Input : mention everything that was said and done. I only know that neither side
Enter Input : objected to very many of the jurymen. I remember the twelve jurymen—four
Enter Input : were petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and six peasants and
Enter Input : artisans of the town. I remember, long before the trial, questions were
Enter Input : continually asked with some surprise, especially by ladies: “Can such a
Enter Input : delicate, complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to
Enter Input : petty officials and even peasants?” and “What can an official, still more
Enter Input : a peasant, understand in such an affair?” All the four officials in the
Enter Input : jury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one who
Enter Input : was rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in society,
Enter Input : who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly,
Enter Input : unpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and
Enter Input : stockings. At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of course,
Enter Input : had never read a single book. The two merchants looked respectable, but
Enter Input : were strangely silent and stolid. One of them was close-shaven, and was
Enter Input : dressed in European style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a
Enter Input : red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need
Enter Input : to speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans of
Enter Input : Skotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of
Enter Input : them also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier
Enter Input : and more uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might well
Enter Input : wonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, “what men like that
Enter Input : could possibly make of such a case?” Yet their faces made a strangely
Enter Input : imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : Karamazov. I don’t quite remember how he described him. The court usher
Enter Input : was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his appearance. There
Enter Input : was a hush through the court. One could have heard a fly. I don’t know how
Enter Input : it was with others, but Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He
Enter Input : looked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that
Enter Input : he had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own
Enter Input : tailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves and
Enter Input : exquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking stiffly
Enter Input : straight in front of him, and sat down in his place with a most
Enter Input : unperturbed air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated Fetyukovitch,
Enter Input : entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court. He was a
Enter Input : tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely long, thin, pale
Enter Input : fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, rather short hair, and thin
Enter Input : lips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile.
Enter Input : He looked about forty. His face would have been pleasant, if it had not
Enter Input : been for his eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set
Enter Input : remarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing
Enter Input : line between them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about
Enter Input : his face. He was in evening dress and white tie.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I remember the President’s first questions to Mitya, about his name, his
Enter Input : calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was so
Enter Input : unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the
Enter Input : prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to take
Enter Input : part in the proceedings—that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was a
Enter Input : long list. Four of the witnesses were not present—Miüsov, who had given
Enter Input : evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov
Enter Input : and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his
Enter Input : sudden death, of which an official statement from the police was
Enter Input : presented. The news of Smerdyakov’s death produced a sudden stir and
Enter Input : whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of
Enter Input : the sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya’s sudden outburst As
Enter Input : soon as the statement of Smerdyakov’s death was made, he cried out aloud
Enter Input : from his place:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was a dog and died like a dog!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President addressed
Enter Input : him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity were
Enter Input : repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times
Enter Input : abruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t again, I won’t. It escaped me. I won’t do it again.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the
Enter Input : public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was under
Enter Input : the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read. It was
Enter Input : rather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he
Enter Input : had been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great
Enter Input : impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole
Enter Input : tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in
Enter Input : a fatal and pitiless light. I remember how, immediately after it had been
Enter Input : read, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Prisoner, do you plead guilty?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya suddenly rose from his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,” he exclaimed, again in a
Enter Input : startling, almost frenzied, voice, “to idleness and debauchery. I meant to
Enter Input : become an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck down
Enter Input : by fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and my
Enter Input : father. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri
Enter Input : Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President again
Enter Input : briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was asked,
Enter Input : and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered the case
Enter Input : to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I saw
Enter Input : them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to
Enter Input : give evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from the
Enter Input : priest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit
Enter Input : as far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them up
Enter Input : one by one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the
Enter Input : prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it
Enter Input : was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. I
Enter Input : only know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first. I
Enter Input : repeat I don’t intend to describe all the questions step by step. Besides,
Enter Input : my account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the speeches
Enter Input : for the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidence
Enter Input : was brought together and set in a strong and significant light, and I took
Enter Input : down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them
Enter Input : in due course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected
Enter Input : episode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly
Enter Input : influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar
Enter Input : characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all, that is,
Enter Input : the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the
Enter Input : arguments the defense had to rely upon. Every one realized it from the
Enter Input : first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single
Enter Input : point, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed.
Enter Input : Every one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute,
Enter Input : that there was no doubt about it, that there could be really no
Enter Input : discussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form, and that the
Enter Input : prisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine that
Enter Input : even the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the
Enter Input : interesting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convinced
Enter Input : of his guilt. What’s more, I believe they would have been mortified if his
Enter Input : guilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened the
Enter Input : effect of the closing scene of the criminal’s acquittal. That he would be
Enter Input : acquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the
Enter Input : very last moment. “He is guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives of
Enter Input : humanity, in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had
Enter Input : come into fashion,” and so on, and so on. And that was why they had
Enter Input : crowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested in the
Enter Input : contest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All were
Enter Input : wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch’s make of such a desperate case; and so they followed his
Enter Input : achievements, step by step, with concentrated attention.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to his
Enter Input : speech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some design, that he
Enter Input : was working towards some object, but it was almost impossible to guess
Enter Input : what it was. His confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable, however.
Enter Input : Every one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that he, after so short a stay,
Enter Input : not more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded
Enter Input : in mastering the case and “had studied it to a nicety.” People described
Enter Input : with relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had “taken down” all the
Enter Input : witnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and,
Enter Input : what’s more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of
Enter Input : their evidence. But it was supposed that he did this rather by way of
Enter Input : sport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had been
Enter Input : omitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he could do
Enter Input : no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was more
Enter Input : aware of this than any one, having some idea of his own in the background,
Enter Input : some concealed weapon of defense, which he would suddenly reveal when the
Enter Input : time came. But meanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed to be
Enter Input : diverting himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s old servant, who had
Enter Input : given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, was
Enter Input : examined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him when
Enter Input : his turn came to question him. It must be noted that Grigory entered the
Enter Input : hall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least disconcerted by
Enter Input : the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him. He gave
Enter Input : evidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with his
Enter Input : Marfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was impossible to make him
Enter Input : contradict himself. The prosecutor questioned him first in detail about
Enter Input : the family life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid
Enter Input : colors. It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and
Enter Input : impartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his
Enter Input : deceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to Mitya and
Enter Input : “hadn’t brought up his children as he should. He’d have been devoured by
Enter Input : lice when he was little, if it hadn’t been for me,” he added, describing
Enter Input : Mitya’s early childhood. “It wasn’t fair either of the father to wrong his
Enter Input : son over his mother’s property, which was by right his.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In reply to the prosecutor’s question what grounds he had for asserting
Enter Input : that Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money relations,
Enter Input : Grigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bring
Enter Input : forward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son was
Enter Input : “unfair,” and that he ought “to have paid him several thousand roubles
Enter Input : more.” I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this question
Enter Input : whether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mitya’s inheritance
Enter Input : with marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, not
Enter Input : excepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact information from any
Enter Input : one; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring forward any
Enter Input : distinct proof. Grigory’s description of the scene at the dinner-table,
Enter Input : when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father, threatening to come back
Enter Input : to kill him, made a sinister impression on the court, especially as the
Enter Input : old servant’s composure in telling it, his parsimony of words and peculiar
Enter Input : phraseology, were as effective as eloquence. He observed that he was not
Enter Input : angry with Mitya for having knocked him down and struck him on the face;
Enter Input : he had forgiven him long ago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov he
Enter Input : observed, crossing himself, that he was a lad of ability, but stupid and
Enter Input : afflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : and his elder son who had taught him to be so. But he defended
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s honesty almost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had
Enter Input : once found the master’s money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it,
Enter Input : had taken it to his master, who had rewarded him with a “gold piece” for
Enter Input : it, and trusted him implicitly from that time forward. He maintained
Enter Input : obstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he was asked
Enter Input : so many questions that I can’t recall them all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him, and the
Enter Input : first question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for “a certain person.”
Enter Input : “Have you ever seen it, you, who were for so many years in close
Enter Input : attendance on your master?” Grigory answered that he had not seen it and
Enter Input : had never heard of the money from any one “till everybody was talking
Enter Input : about it.” This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every one
Enter Input : who could conceivably have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor
Enter Input : asked his question about Dmitri’s inheritance, and got the same answer
Enter Input : from all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.
Enter Input : From the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitch’s persistence on this
Enter Input : subject.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, with your permission I’ll ask you a question,” Fetyukovitch said,
Enter Input : suddenly and unexpectedly. “Of what was that balsam, or, rather,
Enter Input : decoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you used
Enter Input : on that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence
Enter Input : muttered, “There was saffron in it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nothing but saffron? Don’t you remember any other ingredient?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There was milfoil in it, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And pepper perhaps?” Fetyukovitch queried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, there was pepper, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In spirit.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a faint sound of laughter in the court.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank what
Enter Input : was left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to your
Enter Input : wife?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It might have been a tumbler-full.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A glass and a half of neat spirit—is not at all bad, don’t you think? You
Enter Input : might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The
Enter Input : President made a movement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you know for a fact,” Fetyukovitch persisted, “whether you were awake
Enter Input : or not when you saw the open door?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was on my legs.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s not a proof that you were awake.” (There was again laughter in the
Enter Input : court.) “Could you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you
Enter Input : a question—for instance, what year it is?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.
Enter Input : Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am a servant,” Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. “If
Enter Input : my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,
Enter Input : reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowed
Enter Input : with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness.
Enter Input : The public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt in
Enter Input : their minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a
Enter Input : certain cure, have seen “the gates of heaven,” and who did not even know
Enter Input : what year he was living in. But before Grigory left the box another
Enter Input : episode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him
Enter Input : whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Except about the door, all he has said is true,” cried Mitya, in a loud
Enter Input : voice. “For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my blows,
Enter Input : I thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to
Enter Input : my father as seven hundred poodles.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Prisoner, be careful in your language,” the President admonished him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am not a poodle,” Grigory muttered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “All right, it’s I am a poodle myself,” cried Mitya. “If it’s an insult, I
Enter Input : take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. I
Enter Input : was cruel to Æsop too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What Æsop?” the President asked sternly again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly
Enter Input : to be more careful in his language.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the
Enter Input : evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading
Enter Input : witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. It
Enter Input : appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had been
Enter Input : everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the
Enter Input : biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it
Enter Input : is true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely
Enter Input : Mitya’s exploits in the “Metropolis,” all his compromising doings and
Enter Input : sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov’s “wisp of tow.” But even
Enter Input : Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya’s inheritance, and confined
Enter Input : himself to contemptuous generalities.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to the
Enter Input : other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one
Enter Input : could make head or tail of it?” He attributed the tragic crime to the
Enter Input : habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed
Enter Input : condition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions. He was,
Enter Input : in fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This was the first occasion on
Enter Input : which Rakitin showed what he could do, and attracted notice. The
Enter Input : prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the
Enter Input : case, and afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some
Enter Input : ideas from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The picture
Enter Input : drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly
Enter Input : strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitin’s discourse
Enter Input : fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility
Enter Input : of its ideas. There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he
Enter Input : spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which the
Enter Input : counsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage. Answering certain
Enter Input : questions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of his own
Enter Input : sentiments and his success, of which he was, of course, conscious, he went
Enter Input : so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as
Enter Input : “the kept mistress of Samsonov.” He would have given a good deal to take
Enter Input : back his words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at
Enter Input : once. And it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having
Enter Input : been able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so short
Enter Input : a time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me to ask,” began the counsel for the defense, with the most
Enter Input : affable and even respectful smile, “you are, of course, the same Mr.
Enter Input : Rakitin whose pamphlet, _The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father Zossima_,
Enter Input : published by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and religious
Enter Input : reflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to the
Enter Input : bishop, I have just read with such pleasure?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,”
Enter Input : muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost
Enter Input : ashamed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, that’s excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to, take
Enter Input : the widest view of every social question. Your most instructive pamphlet
Enter Input : has been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop, and has
Enter Input : been of appreciable service.... But this is the chief thing I should like
Enter Input : to learn from you. You stated just now that you were very intimately
Enter Input : acquainted with Madame Svyetlov.” (It must be noted that Grushenka’s
Enter Input : surname was Svyetlov. I heard it for the first time that day, during the
Enter Input : case.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and who
Enter Input : can be responsible for every one he meets?” cried Rakitin, flushing all
Enter Input : over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I understand, I quite understand,” cried Fetyukovitch, as though he, too,
Enter Input : were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. “You, like any other,
Enter Input : might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautiful
Enter Input : woman who would readily entertain the _élite_ of the youth of the
Enter Input : neighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ... It has come to my
Enter Input : knowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of months
Enter Input : ago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, and promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him
Enter Input : to her in his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the evening
Enter Input : of the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the
Enter Input : present investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov to
Enter Input : Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from Madame
Enter Input : Svyetlov as a reward, that’s what I wanted to hear from you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It was a joke.... I don’t see of what interest that can be to you.... I
Enter Input : took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you did take— But you have not given it back yet ... or have you?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s of no consequence,” muttered Rakitin, “I refuse to answer such
Enter Input : questions.... Of course I shall give it back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no more
Enter Input : questions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box not
Enter Input : absolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect left by the
Enter Input : lofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitch’s
Enter Input : expression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to suggest to the public
Enter Input : “this is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons who accuse him.” I
Enter Input : remember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreak
Enter Input : from Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to
Enter Input : Grushenka, he suddenly shouted “Bernard!” When, after Rakitin’s
Enter Input : cross-examination, the President asked the prisoner if he had anything to
Enter Input : say, Mitya cried loudly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Since I’ve been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is a
Enter Input : contemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn’t believe in God; he
Enter Input : took the bishop in!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his
Enter Input : language, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov’s evidence was a
Enter Input : failure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared in ragged and
Enter Input : dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and expert
Enter Input : observation of the police officers, he turned out to be hopelessly drunk.
Enter Input : On being asked about Mitya’s attack upon him, he refused to answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me yonder.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha, my little son. ‘Father, father, how he insulted you!’ He said
Enter Input : that at the stone. Now he is dying....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his knees before
Enter Input : the President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of the
Enter Input : public. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazed
Enter Input : people more and more by his minute knowledge of the case. Thus, for
Enter Input : example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, very
Enter Input : prejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his fingers that on his
Enter Input : first visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles, “or
Enter Input : very little less. Just think what he squandered on those gypsy girls
Enter Input : alone! And as for our lousy peasants, it wasn’t a case of flinging half a
Enter Input : rouble in the street, he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each,
Enter Input : at least, he didn’t give them less. And what a lot of money was simply
Enter Input : stolen from him! And if any one did steal, he did not leave a receipt. How
Enter Input : could one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the
Enter Input : time? Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for their
Enter Input : souls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village girls! They’re
Enter Input : completely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be poor.” He
Enter Input : recalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all up. So the
Enter Input : theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been put
Enter Input : aside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it with my
Enter Input : own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,” cried
Enter Input : Trifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy “his betters.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried to refute
Enter Input : his evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal
Enter Input : at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another peasant
Enter Input : called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles
Enter Input : dropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and had given them to Trifon
Enter Input : Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so. “Well,”
Enter Input : asked the lawyer, “did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr.
Enter Input : Karamazov?” Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain.... He was obliged, after
Enter Input : the peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundred
Enter Input : roubles, only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch “in perfect honesty, and it’s only because his honor was in
Enter Input : liquor at the time, he wouldn’t remember it.” But, as he had denied the
Enter Input : incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove
Enter Input : it, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded
Enter Input : with great suspicion. So one of the most dangerous witnesses brought
Enter Input : forward by the prosecution was again discredited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude of pride
Enter Input : and independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the
Enter Input : service of the Crown, and that “Pan Mitya” had offered them three thousand
Enter Input : “to buy their honor,” and that they had seen a large sum of money in his
Enter Input : hands. Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words into
Enter Input : his sentences, and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the
Enter Input : eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, and
Enter Input : ended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch caught them, too,
Enter Input : in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was forced, in spite of his
Enter Input : evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack of
Enter Input : cards for the one he had provided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated
Enter Input : during the game. Kalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left the
Enter Input : witness-box with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous
Enter Input : witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, and
Enter Input : dismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers and experts were lost
Enter Input : in admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose
Enter Input : could be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case for the
Enter Input : prosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more tragically
Enter Input : overwhelming. But from the confidence of the “great magician” they saw
Enter Input : that he was serene, and they waited, feeling that “such a man” had not
Enter Input : come from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return
Enter Input : unsuccessful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the
Enter Input : prisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much
Enter Input : upon it. The medical line of defense had only been taken up through the
Enter Input : insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor from
Enter Input : Moscow on purpose. The case for the defense could, of course, lose nothing
Enter Input : by it and might, with luck, gain something from it. There was, however, an
Enter Input : element of comedy about it, through the difference of opinion of the
Enter Input : doctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our
Enter Input : doctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two latter
Enter Input : appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube.
Enter Input : He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdy
Enter Input : build. He was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town. He was
Enter Input : a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or
Enter Input : Moravian brother, I am not quite sure which. He had been living amongst us
Enter Input : for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted
Enter Input : and humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited
Enter Input : them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he was as
Enter Input : obstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into his head, there was
Enter Input : no shaking it. Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, that
Enter Input : the famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his presence
Enter Input : among us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor
Enter Input : Herzenstube’s qualifications. Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five
Enter Input : roubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to take
Enter Input : advantage of his arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense.
Enter Input : All these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube,
Enter Input : and the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme
Enter Input : harshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them,
Enter Input : “Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube? He, he!”
Enter Input : Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three
Enter Input : doctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner’s
Enter Input : mental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his grounds for this
Enter Input : opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was not only
Enter Input : evident in many of the prisoner’s actions in the past, but was apparent
Enter Input : even now at this very moment. When he was asked to explain how it was
Enter Input : apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple-hearted
Enter Input : directness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had “an
Enter Input : extraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances”; that he had “marched
Enter Input : in like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it would have been
Enter Input : more natural for him to look to the left where, among the public, the
Enter Input : ladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex
Enter Input : and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,” the
Enter Input : old man concluded in his peculiar language.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed in
Enter Input : German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always been
Enter Input : a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly, better
Enter Input : indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs,
Enter Input : always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most
Enter Input : expressive sayings in the whole world. I may remark, too, that in
Enter Input : conversation, through absent-mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary
Enter Input : words, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew them
Enter Input : perfectly. The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German, and at
Enter Input : such times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to
Enter Input : catch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he
Enter Input : had found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to have
Enter Input : looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the
Enter Input : audience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too,
Enter Input : that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary
Enter Input : conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures. And so his unexpected
Enter Input : observation struck every one as very queer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and
Enter Input : emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner’s mental condition
Enter Input : abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and with erudition of
Enter Input : “aberration” and “mania,” and argued that, from all the facts collected,
Enter Input : the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several
Enter Input : days before his arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him, it
Enter Input : must, even if he were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he
Enter Input : had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which
Enter Input : premised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (It
Enter Input : must be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use of
Enter Input : very learned and professional language.) “All his actions are in
Enter Input : contravention of common sense and logic,” he continued. “Not to refer to
Enter Input : what I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole catastrophe,
Enter Input : the day before yesterday, while he was talking to me, he had an
Enter Input : unaccountably fixed look in his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there
Enter Input : was nothing to laugh at. He showed continual and inexplicable
Enter Input : irritability, using strange words, ‘Bernard!’ ‘Ethics!’ and others equally
Enter Input : inappropriate.” But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that
Enter Input : the prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which
Enter Input : he considered himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary
Enter Input : irritation, though he could speak comparatively lightly of other
Enter Input : misfortunes and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in the
Enter Input : past, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on,
Enter Input : flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to be a disinterested
Enter Input : and not grasping man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “As to the opinion of my learned colleague,” the Moscow doctor added
Enter Input : ironically in conclusion, “that the prisoner would, on entering the court,
Enter Input : have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him, I will
Enter Input : only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radically
Enter Input : unsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on entering the court
Enter Input : where his fate will be decided, would not naturally look straight before
Enter Input : him in that fixed way, and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal
Enter Input : mental condition, at the same time I maintain that he would naturally not
Enter Input : look to the left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to find
Enter Input : his legal adviser, on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defense
Enter Input : all his future depends.” The doctor expressed his opinion positively and
Enter Input : emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch
Enter Input : of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts. In his opinion
Enter Input : the prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a perfectly normal
Enter Input : condition, and, although he certainly must have been in a nervous and
Enter Input : exceedingly excited state before his arrest, this might have been due to
Enter Input : several perfectly obvious causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness,
Enter Input : and so on. But this nervous condition would not involve the mental
Enter Input : aberration of which mention had just been made. As to the question whether
Enter Input : the prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering
Enter Input : the court, “in his modest opinion,” the prisoner would naturally look
Enter Input : straight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done, as that
Enter Input : was where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting. So that it
Enter Input : was just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectly
Enter Input : normal state of mind at the present. The young doctor concluded his
Enter Input : “modest” testimony with some heat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Bravo, doctor!” cried Mitya, from his seat, “just so!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor’s opinion had a
Enter Input : decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appeared
Enter Input : afterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor Herzenstube, when called
Enter Input : as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya. As an old resident
Enter Input : in the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he furnished
Enter Input : some facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though
Enter Input : recalling something, he added:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he had a
Enter Input : good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know. But the
Enter Input : Russian proverb says, ‘If a man has one head, it’s good, but if another
Enter Input : clever man comes to visit him, it would be better still, for then there
Enter Input : will be two heads and not only one.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One head is good, but two are better,” the prosecutor put in impatiently.
Enter Input : He knew the old man’s habit of talking slowly and deliberately, regardless
Enter Input : of the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing, and
Enter Input : highly prizing his flat, dull and always gleefully complacent German wit.
Enter Input : The old man was fond of making jokes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, that’s what I say,” he went on stubbornly. “One head is good,
Enter Input : but two are much better, but he did not meet another head with wits, and
Enter Input : his wits went. Where did they go? I’ve forgotten the word.” He went on,
Enter Input : passing his hand before his eyes, “Oh, yes, _spazieren_.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Wandering?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, wandering, that’s what I say. Well, his wits went wandering and
Enter Input : fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he was a grateful
Enter Input : and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well, a little chap so high,
Enter Input : left neglected by his father in the back yard, when he ran about without
Enter Input : boots on his feet, and his little breeches hanging by one button.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man’s
Enter Input : voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting something, and
Enter Input : caught at it instantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty-five
Enter Input : then, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry for the boy then; I
Enter Input : asked myself why shouldn’t I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what? I’ve
Enter Input : forgotten what it’s called. A pound of what children are very fond of,
Enter Input : what is it, what is it?” The doctor began waving his hands again. “It
Enter Input : grows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Apples?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are a
Enter Input : lot of them, and all little. You put them in the mouth and crack.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nuts?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Quite so, nuts, I say so.” The doctor repeated in the calmest way as
Enter Input : though he had been at no loss for a word. “And I bought him a pound of
Enter Input : nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before. And I
Enter Input : lifted my finger and said to him, ‘Boy, _Gott der Vater_.’ He laughed and
Enter Input : said, ‘_Gott der Vater_.’... ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ He laughed again and
Enter Input : lisped, ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ Then he laughed and
Enter Input : said as best he could, ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ I went away, and two
Enter Input : days after I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me of himself,
Enter Input : ‘Uncle, _Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_,’ and he had only forgotten ‘_Gott
Enter Input : der heilige Geist_.’ But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for
Enter Input : him again. But he was taken away, and I did not see him again.
Enter Input : Twenty-three years passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, a
Enter Input : white-haired old man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man,
Enter Input : whom I should never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,
Enter Input : laughing, ‘_Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_, and _Gott der heilige Geist_.
Enter Input : I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for
Enter Input : no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one that ever
Enter Input : did.’ And then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard,
Enter Input : without boots on his feet, and my heart was touched and I said, ‘You are a
Enter Input : grateful young man, for you have remembered all your life the pound of
Enter Input : nuts I bought you in your childhood.’ And I embraced him and blessed him.
Enter Input : And I shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian
Enter Input : often laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. And
Enter Input : now, alas!...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,”
Enter Input : Mitya cried suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the
Enter Input : public. But the chief sensation in Mitya’s favor was created by the
Enter Input : evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,
Enter Input : when the witnesses _à décharge_, that is, called by the defense, began
Enter Input : giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to
Enter Input : Mitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to the
Enter Input : counsel for the defense. But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyosha
Enter Input : was examined, and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive
Enter Input : evidence against one important point made by the prosecution.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not required
Enter Input : to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him very gently
Enter Input : and sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for goodness had
Enter Input : preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint, but
Enter Input : his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to
Enter Input : one question, he sketched his brother’s character as that of a man,
Enter Input : violent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same
Enter Input : time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if
Enter Input : necessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka
Enter Input : and his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an
Enter Input : intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the suggestion that
Enter Input : his brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though he
Enter Input : recognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession
Enter Input : with Mitya; that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he had
Enter Input : been cheated of by his father, and that, indifferent as he was to money as
Enter Input : a rule, he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury. As
Enter Input : for the rivalry of the two “ladies,” as the prosecutor expressed it—that
Enter Input : is, of Grushenka and Katya—he answered evasively and was even unwilling to
Enter Input : answer one or two questions altogether.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your father?”
Enter Input : asked the prosecutor. “You can refuse to answer if you think necessary,”
Enter Input : he added.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He did not tell me so directly,” answered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How so? Did he indirectly?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at an
Enter Input : extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you believed him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higher
Enter Input : feeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed saved
Enter Input : him, for it was not he killed my father,” Alyosha said firmly, in a loud
Enter Input : voice that was heard throughout the court.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your
Enter Input : conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for
Enter Input : your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is
Enter Input : known to us already from the preliminary investigation. I won’t attempt to
Enter Input : conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the
Enter Input : other evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential
Enter Input : to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your
Enter Input : brother’s innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you
Enter Input : gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,”
Enter Input : replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. “I made no accusation against
Enter Input : Smerdyakov of myself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yet you gave evidence against him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri’s words. I was told what took
Enter Input : place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was
Enter Input : examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he
Enter Input : didn’t commit the murder, then—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded
Enter Input : of your brother’s innocence?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn’t lie to me. I saw
Enter Input : from his face he wasn’t lying.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I have no other proof.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And of Smerdyakov’s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother’s
Enter Input : word and the expression of his face?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I have no other proof.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left
Enter Input : by Alyosha’s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been
Enter Input : talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some
Enter Input : one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered
Enter Input : together some extraordinary proofs of his brother’s innocence and
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except
Enter Input : certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking Alyosha when
Enter Input : it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father and
Enter Input : that he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance, at
Enter Input : their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he answered,
Enter Input : as though only just recollecting and understanding something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I remember one circumstance now which I’d quite forgotten myself. It
Enter Input : wasn’t clear to me at the time, but now—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he recounted
Enter Input : eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree,
Enter Input : on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, “the
Enter Input : upper part of the breast,” and had repeated several times that he had a
Enter Input : means of regaining his honor, that that means was here, here on his
Enter Input : breast. “I thought, when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it
Enter Input : was in his heart,” Alyosha continued, “that he might find in his heart
Enter Input : strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him
Enter Input : and which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did think
Enter Input : at the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace he
Enter Input : was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some
Enter Input : violence to him. Yet it was just then that he pointed to something on his
Enter Input : breast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart
Enter Input : is not on that part of the breast, but below, and that he struck himself
Enter Input : much too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My
Enter Input : idea seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to
Enter Input : that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just so,” Mitya cried from his place. “That’s right, Alyosha, it was the
Enter Input : little bag I struck with my fist.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and at
Enter Input : the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by his
Enter Input : recollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably
Enter Input : just that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have returned to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he had yet
Enter Input : determined not to repay her and to use for another purpose—namely, to
Enter Input : enable him to elope with Grushenka, if she consented.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It is so, it must be so,” exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. “My
Enter Input : brother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he said
Enter Input : _half_ several times) he could free himself from at once, but that he was
Enter Input : so unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldn’t do it ... that he knew
Enter Input : beforehand he was incapable of doing it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on this
Enter Input : part of the breast?” Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, ‘Why does he strike
Enter Input : himself up there when the heart is lower down?’ and the thought seemed
Enter Input : stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed
Enter Input : through my mind. That’s what brought it back to me just now. How could I
Enter Input : have forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant when he said
Enter Input : he had the means but wouldn’t give back that fifteen hundred. And when he
Enter Input : was arrested at Mokroe he cried out—I know, I was told it—that he
Enter Input : considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had the
Enter Input : means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her,
Enter Input : he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain
Enter Input : a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what
Enter Input : torture that debt has been to him!” Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe once
Enter Input : more how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the question,
Enter Input : “Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had simply
Enter Input : struck himself with his fist on the breast?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But it was not with his fist,” cried Alyosha; “he pointed with his
Enter Input : fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so completely
Enter Input : forgotten it till this moment?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness’s
Enter Input : evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to the
Enter Input : fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck, and
Enter Input : that that was, of course, the disgrace, “A disgrace I cannot deny, the
Enter Input : most shameful act of my whole life,” cried Mitya. “I might have repaid it
Enter Input : and didn’t repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than
Enter Input : give it back. And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand
Enter Input : I shouldn’t give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So Alyosha’s cross-examination ended. What was important and striking
Enter Input : about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though this
Enter Input : were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did go
Enter Input : some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained
Enter Input : fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the
Enter Input : preliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred
Enter Input : roubles were “his own.” Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved
Enter Input : away to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: “How was
Enter Input : it I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back to
Enter Input : me now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered something
Enter Input : extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettes
Enter Input : and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get a
Enter Input : better view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned “white as
Enter Input : a sheet” on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly, almost
Enter Input : timidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated;
Enter Input : but there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark
Enter Input : that many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that
Enter Input : moment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the
Enter Input : court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear
Enter Input : composed. The President began his examination discreetly and very
Enter Input : respectfully, as though afraid to touch on “certain chords,” and showing
Enter Input : consideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first
Enter Input : questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly
Enter Input : betrothed to the prisoner, “until he left me of his own accord...” she
Enter Input : added quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had
Enter Input : entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, “I didn’t
Enter Input : give him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was
Enter Input : in great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the
Enter Input : understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to.
Enter Input : There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in
Enter Input : detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got
Enter Input : money from his father,” she went on. “I have never doubted his
Enter Input : disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money
Enter Input : matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his
Enter Input : father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with
Enter Input : his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by
Enter Input : his father. I don’t remember any threat uttered by him against his father.
Enter Input : He certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to me
Enter Input : at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that
Enter Input : unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see me ...
Enter Input : and I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite
Enter Input : him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,” she
Enter Input : added suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her voice. “I was
Enter Input : once indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand,
Enter Input : and I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I should
Enter Input : ever be in a position to repay my debt.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch began
Enter Input : his cross-examination.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?”
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way, instantly scenting
Enter Input : something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis that, though
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance of
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing about the episode of the four
Enter Input : thousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her “bowing to the ground to
Enter Input : him.” She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that was
Enter Input : strange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know
Enter Input : till the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the
Enter Input : court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. She
Enter Input : told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her
Enter Input : bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and her
Enter Input : going to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that
Enter Input : Mitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should “send him
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna” to fetch the money. She generously concealed that and
Enter Input : was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run
Enter Input : to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money.
Enter Input : It was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. The
Enter Input : court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something unexampled.
Enter Input : Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was,
Enter Input : such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation,
Enter Input : seemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To save the man who had
Enter Input : deceived and insulted her and to help, in however small a degree, in
Enter Input : saving him, by creating a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the
Enter Input : figure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent
Enter Input : girl, handed her his last four thousand roubles—all he had in the
Enter Input : world—was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ... I
Enter Input : had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it
Enter Input : later (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the town
Enter Input : afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite
Enter Input : complete—that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young lady
Enter Input : depart “with nothing but a respectful bow.” It was hinted that something
Enter Input : was here omitted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,” the
Enter Input : most highly respected of our ladies maintained, “even then it’s very
Enter Input : doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way,
Enter Input : even for the sake of saving her father.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid
Enter Input : sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like that?
Enter Input : She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell everything.
Enter Input : Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story
Enter Input : only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by
Enter Input : it. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost
Enter Input : shame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture
Enter Input : upon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her.
Enter Input : Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to
Enter Input : give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same
Enter Input : man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three thousand—the
Enter Input : idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of
Enter Input : theft, at least, was as good as disproved. “The case” was thrown into
Enter Input : quite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for
Enter Input : him.... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving
Enter Input : her evidence, he jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his
Enter Input : face in his hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a
Enter Input : sobbing voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katya, why have you ruined me?” and his sobs were audible all over the
Enter Input : court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now I am condemned!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms
Enter Input : across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in
Enter Input : her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who were
Enter Input : sitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over as
Enter Input : though in a fever. Grushenka was called.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause
Enter Input : of Mitya’s ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one—all the lawyers said
Enter Input : the same afterwards—that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoner
Enter Input : would at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that later. A few
Enter Input : words first about Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black shawl
Enter Input : on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her smooth, noiseless
Enter Input : tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure. She
Enter Input : looked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither to the right
Enter Input : nor to the left. To my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment,
Enter Input : and not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too,
Enter Input : that she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she
Enter Input : was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and
Enter Input : inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not
Enter Input : stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry and eager
Enter Input : to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element of
Enter Input : timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it was
Enter Input : not strange that her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry,
Enter Input : contemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note of
Enter Input : self-condemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a
Enter Input : desperate plunge; as though she felt, “I don’t care what happens, I’ll say
Enter Input : it....” Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked
Enter Input : curtly, “That’s all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester
Enter Input : me?” But a minute later she added, “It was all my fault. I was laughing at
Enter Input : them both—at the old man and at him, too—and I brought both of them to
Enter Input : this. It was all on account of me it happened.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Samsonov’s name came up somehow. “That’s nobody’s business,” she snapped
Enter Input : at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. “He was my benefactor; he took
Enter Input : me when I hadn’t a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.” The
Enter Input : President reminded her, though very politely, that she must answer the
Enter Input : questions directly, without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka
Enter Input : crimsoned and her eyes flashed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heard
Enter Input : from “that wicked wretch” that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with
Enter Input : notes for three thousand in it. “But that was all foolishness. I was only
Enter Input : laughing. I wouldn’t have gone to him for anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To whom are you referring as ‘that wicked wretch’?” inquired the
Enter Input : prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself last
Enter Input : night.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a definite
Enter Input : accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. The woman
Enter Input : who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let me
Enter Input : tell you,” Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and
Enter Input : there was a vindictive note in her voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was again asked to whom she was referring.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered me
Enter Input : chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There’s not much true shame about her, I
Enter Input : can tell you that....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to moderate
Enter Input : her language. But the jealous woman’s heart was burning, and she did not
Enter Input : care what she did.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,” the prosecutor asked, “every
Enter Input : one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: ‘It’s all my
Enter Input : fault. We’ll go to Siberia together!’ So you already believed him to have
Enter Input : murdered his father?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t remember what I felt at the time,” answered Grushenka. “Every one
Enter Input : was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it was my
Enter Input : fault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when he said he
Enter Input : wasn’t guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and always
Enter Input : shall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among other
Enter Input : things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles “you paid him
Enter Input : for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There was nothing strange about his taking the money,” sneered Grushenka,
Enter Input : with angry contempt. “He was always coming to me for money: he used to get
Enter Input : thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had
Enter Input : enough to keep him without my help.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?” Fetyukovitch asked, in
Enter Input : spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother’s sister. But he’s always
Enter Input : besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of
Enter Input : me.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in
Enter Input : the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned
Enter Input : purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she
Enter Input : came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she
Enter Input : was angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin’s speech, of his
Enter Input : noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder
Enter Input : of Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it
Enter Input : was another godsend. Grushenka’s cross-examination did not last long and,
Enter Input : of course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. She
Enter Input : left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of
Enter Input : contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidence
Enter Input : and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat as though
Enter Input : turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan was called to give evidence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of the
Enter Input : court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or
Enter Input : some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was
Enter Input : ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed to
Enter Input : have heard it and it only came out later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal
Enter Input : witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned.
Enter Input : Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almost
Enter Input : fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably had
Enter Input : little information to give after all that had been given. Time was
Enter Input : passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one,
Enter Input : and with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was
Enter Input : irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression, on me at
Enter Input : least: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man’s. His eyes
Enter Input : were lusterless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha
Enter Input : jumped up from his seat and moaned “Ah!” I remember that, but it was
Enter Input : hardly noticed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath,
Enter Input : that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he must
Enter Input : bear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivan
Enter Input : listened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into a
Enter Input : smile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment,
Enter Input : finished, he laughed outright.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, and what else?” he asked in a loud voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange.
Enter Input : The President showed signs of uneasiness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ... are perhaps still unwell?” he began, looking everywhere for the
Enter Input : usher.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell
Enter Input : you something interesting,” Ivan answered with sudden calmness and
Enter Input : respectfulness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You have some special communication to make?” the President went on,
Enter Input : still mistrustfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered,
Enter Input : almost stammering:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No ... I haven’t. I have nothing particular.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,
Enter Input : with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more
Enter Input : marked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered that
Enter Input : he did not know. He knew nothing of his father’s money relations with
Enter Input : Dmitri. “I wasn’t interested in the subject,” he added. Threats to murder
Enter Input : his father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he
Enter Input : had heard from Smerdyakov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The same thing over and over again,” he interrupted suddenly, with a look
Enter Input : of weariness. “I have nothing particular to tell the court.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,” the President began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them
Enter Input : to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in an
Enter Input : exhausted voice:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walk
Enter Input : out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though he
Enter Input : had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it go?
Enter Input : ‘I’ll stand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’ They were trying to put
Enter Input : on her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she said, ‘I’ll
Enter Input : stand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’... It’s in some book about
Enter Input : the peasantry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean by that?” the President asked severely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, this,” Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. “Here’s the money
Enter Input : ... the notes that lay in that envelope” (he nodded towards the table on
Enter Input : which lay the material evidence), “for the sake of which our father was
Enter Input : murdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same
Enter Input : money?” the President asked wonderingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was with
Enter Input : him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother, killed our
Enter Input : father. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who doesn’t desire
Enter Input : his father’s death?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Are you in your right mind?” broke involuntarily from the President.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all of
Enter Input : you ... as all these ... ugly faces.” He turned suddenly to the audience.
Enter Input : “My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,” he
Enter Input : snarled, with furious contempt. “They keep up the sham with one another.
Enter Input : Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devours
Enter Input : another.... If there hadn’t been a murder, they’d have been angry and gone
Enter Input : home ill-humored. It’s a spectacle they want! _Panem et circenses_. Though
Enter Input : I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ’s sake!”
Enter Input : He suddenly clutched his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, “He is ill.
Enter Input : Don’t believe him: he has brain fever.” Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively
Enter Input : from her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and
Enter Input : greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strange
Enter Input : smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,” Ivan began
Enter Input : again. “You can’t expect eloquence from a murderer,” he added suddenly for
Enter Input : some reason and laughed a queer laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two other
Enter Input : judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears
Enter Input : as he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The President seemed
Enter Input : suddenly to recollect himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm
Enter Input : yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have something
Enter Input : to tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not
Enter Input : delirious?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won’t send you
Enter Input : proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing but
Enter Input : envelopes—one is enough. I’ve no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,” he
Enter Input : smiled thoughtfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Who is your witness?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! _Le diable
Enter Input : n’existe point!_ Don’t pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful devil,” he
Enter Input : added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.
Enter Input : “He is here somewhere, no doubt—under that table with the material
Enter Input : evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listen
Enter Input : to me. I told him I don’t want to keep quiet, and he talked about the
Enter Input : geological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the monster ... he’s been
Enter Input : singing a hymn. That’s because his heart is light! It’s like a drunken man
Enter Input : in the street bawling how ‘Vanka went to Petersburg,’ and I would give a
Enter Input : quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don’t know me! Oh,
Enter Input : how stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him! I didn’t
Enter Input : come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?...”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him again.
Enter Input : But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, but
Enter Input : the court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are you about?” he cried, staring into the man’s face, and suddenly
Enter Input : seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But the
Enter Input : police were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And all
Enter Input : the time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed something
Enter Input : incoherent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don’t remember everything as
Enter Input : it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. I only know that
Enter Input : afterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood what
Enter Input : had happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he very
Enter Input : reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctor
Enter Input : had seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but
Enter Input : that, until he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively,
Enter Input : so that nothing could have been foreseen—that he had, in fact, insisted on
Enter Input : giving evidence. But before every one had completely regained their
Enter Input : composure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking
Enter Input : loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them not
Enter Input : to remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a
Enter Input : document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It’s a letter
Enter Input : from that monster ... that man there, there!” she pointed to Mitya. “It
Enter Input : was he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me how
Enter Input : he would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he is
Enter Input : delirious!” she kept crying out, beside herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The court usher took the document she held out to the President, and she,
Enter Input : dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began convulsively
Enter Input : and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for
Enter Input : fear she should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed up
Enter Input : was that letter Mitya had written at the “Metropolis” tavern, which Ivan
Enter Input : had spoken of as a “mathematical proof.” Alas! its mathematical
Enter Input : conclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mitya
Enter Input : might have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less
Enter Input : terrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What
Enter Input : followed is still confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have
Enter Input : at once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on
Enter Input : both sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness. On being
Enter Input : gently asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently,
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,” she added,
Enter Input : evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving
Enter Input : evidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and
Enter Input : under what circumstances she received it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he wrote it the
Enter Input : day before that, at the tavern—that is, two days before he committed the
Enter Input : crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!” she cried breathlessly.
Enter Input : “He hated me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and was
Enter Input : running after that creature ... and because he owed me that three
Enter Input : thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of
Enter Input : his own meanness! This is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg
Enter Input : you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father,
Enter Input : he came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and what he
Enter Input : wanted it for. Yes, yes—to win that creature and carry her off. I knew
Enter Input : then that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I,
Enter Input : I, who gave him that money, who offered it to him on the pretext of his
Enter Input : sending it to my sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in
Enter Input : the face and said that he could send it when he liked, ‘in a month’s time
Enter Input : would do.’ How, how could he have failed to understand that I was
Enter Input : practically telling him to his face, ‘You want money to be false to me
Enter Input : with your creature, so here’s the money for you. I give it to you myself.
Enter Input : Take it, if you have so little honor as to take it!’ I wanted to prove
Enter Input : what he was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it
Enter Input : with that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all
Enter Input : about it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money to
Enter Input : test him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take
Enter Input : it from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and he
Enter Input : understood it all and he took it—he carried off my money!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s true, Katya,” Mitya roared suddenly, “I looked into your eyes and
Enter Input : I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money. Despise me
Enter Input : as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I’ve deserved it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Prisoner,” cried the President, “another word and I will order you to be
Enter Input : removed.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That money was a torment to him,” Katya went on with impulsive haste. “He
Enter Input : wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that’s true; but he needed money for
Enter Input : that creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didn’t repay me, and
Enter Input : went off with her to that village where he was arrested. There, again, he
Enter Input : squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a
Enter Input : day before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he wrote
Enter Input : it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite, and feeling
Enter Input : certain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, even
Enter Input : if he did kill him, or else he wouldn’t have written it. For he knew I
Enter Input : shouldn’t want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read it
Enter Input : attentively—more attentively, please—and you will see that he had
Enter Input : described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill his
Enter Input : father and where his money was kept. Look, please, don’t overlook that,
Enter Input : there’s one phrase there, ‘I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone
Enter Input : away.’ So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,”
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant
Enter Input : triumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and
Enter Input : detected every meaning underlining it. “If he hadn’t been drunk, he
Enter Input : wouldn’t have written to me; but, look, everything is written there
Enter Input : beforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program of
Enter Input : it!” she exclaimed frantically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she
Enter Input : had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with
Enter Input : anger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she
Enter Input : had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by
Enter Input : the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming
Enter Input : impression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the
Enter Input : letter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s mine, mine!” cried Mitya. “I shouldn’t have written it, if I hadn’t
Enter Input : been drunk!... We’ve hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear,
Enter Input : I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn’t love me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutor
Enter Input : and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her, chiefly to
Enter Input : ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give her
Enter Input : evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor and
Enter Input : my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised me
Enter Input : so!” Katya cried madly. “Oh, he has despised me horribly, he has always
Enter Input : despised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very moment that
Enter Input : I bowed down to him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at
Enter Input : the time, but for a long time I wouldn’t believe it. How often I have read
Enter Input : it in his eyes, ‘You came of yourself, though.’ Oh, he didn’t understand,
Enter Input : he had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but baseness, he
Enter Input : judged me by himself, he thought every one was like himself!” Katya hissed
Enter Input : furiously, in a perfect frenzy. “And he only wanted to marry me, because
Enter Input : I’d inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always
Enter Input : suspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was always
Enter Input : convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him,
Enter Input : because I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever
Enter Input : for it, and so to be superior to me—that’s why he wanted to marry me!
Enter Input : That’s so, that’s all so! I tried to conquer him by my love—a love that
Enter Input : knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he
Enter Input : understood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed? He is a
Enter Input : monster! I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought me
Enter Input : from the tavern—and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to
Enter Input : forgive him everything, everything—even his treachery!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I can’t
Enter Input : help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria
Enter Input : and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, “We
Enter Input : understand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,”
Enter Input : and so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving,
Enter Input : hysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary clearness,
Enter Input : which is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought
Enter Input : states, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last
Enter Input : two months trying to save “the monster and murderer,” his brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He tortured himself,” she exclaimed, “he was always trying to minimize
Enter Input : his brother’s guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved his
Enter Input : father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender,
Enter Input : over-tender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He told
Enter Input : me everything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as his only
Enter Input : friend. I have the honor to be his only friend!” she cried suddenly with a
Enter Input : sort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. “He had been twice to see
Enter Input : Smerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, ‘If it was not my brother, but
Enter Input : Smerdyakov committed the murder’ (for the legend was circulating
Enter Input : everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), ‘perhaps I too am guilty, for
Enter Input : Smerdyakov knew I didn’t like my father and perhaps believed that I
Enter Input : desired my father’s death.’ Then I brought out that letter and showed it
Enter Input : him. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done it, and he was
Enter Input : overwhelmed by it. He couldn’t endure the thought that his own brother was
Enter Input : a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During the
Enter Input : last few days he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mind
Enter Input : was giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the
Enter Input : streets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day
Enter Input : before yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever—and all
Enter Input : on his account, on account of this monster! And last night he learnt that
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind
Enter Input : ... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once in
Enter Input : a lifetime—at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold!
Enter Input : But it was in Katya’s character, and it was such a moment in her life. It
Enter Input : was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a
Enter Input : young profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before,
Enter Input : in her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty
Enter Input : before all these people, telling of Mitya’s generous conduct, in the hope
Enter Input : of softening his fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself;
Enter Input : but this time it was for another, and perhaps only now—perhaps only at
Enter Input : this moment—she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She had
Enter Input : sacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden that he
Enter Input : had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the
Enter Input : murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to save
Enter Input : his good name, his reputation!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one—was she lying in her
Enter Input : description of her former relations with Mitya?—that was the question. No,
Enter Input : she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised
Enter Input : her for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had been
Enter Input : firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-hearted
Enter Input : Mitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and despising her.
Enter Input : She had loved him with an hysterical, “lacerated” love only from pride,
Enter Input : from wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more like
Enter Input : revenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love,
Enter Input : perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya’s faithlessness
Enter Input : had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could not
Enter Input : forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and all
Enter Input : that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended
Enter Input : woman’s breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya,
Enter Input : but she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had she given full expression
Enter Input : to her feelings than the tension of course was over and she was
Enter Input : overwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor,
Enter Input : sobbing and screaming. She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with
Enter Input : a wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya,” she wailed, “your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shown
Enter Input : you what she is!” she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a
Enter Input : signal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from the
Enter Input : court. She wouldn’t allow it. She fought and struggled to get back to
Enter Input : Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was
Enter Input : overpowered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been
Enter Input : satisfied—the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscow
Enter Input : doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sent
Enter Input : the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announced
Enter Input : to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of
Enter Input : brain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer to questions
Enter Input : from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that the
Enter Input : patient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and
Enter Input : that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had
Enter Input : not consented to be looked after. “He was certainly not in a normal state
Enter Input : of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he
Enter Input : met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited
Enter Input : him every evening,” said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his
Enter Input : evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the
Enter Input : judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected
Enter Input : pieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only
Enter Input : repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their
Enter Input : characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the
Enter Input : prosecutor’s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was
Enter Input : excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were
Enter Input : awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense
Enter Input : impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna’s
Enter Input : evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had
Enter Input : been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was
Enter Input : just eight o’clock when the President returned to his seat and our
Enter Input : prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VI. The Prosecutor’s Speech. Sketches Of Character
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with
Enter Input : cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. He
Enter Input : described this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his
Enter Input : _chef-d’œuvre_, the _chef-d’œuvre_ of his whole life, as his swan-song. He
Enter Input : died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he had
Enter Input : the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last
Enter Input : song. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that
Enter Input : speech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least
Enter Input : some feeling for the public welfare and “the eternal question” lay
Enter Input : concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity.
Enter Input : He genuinely believed in the prisoner’s guilt; he was accusing him not as
Enter Input : an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a
Enter Input : genuine passion “for the security of society.” Even the ladies in the
Enter Input : audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted
Enter Input : that he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking
Enter Input : voice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his
Enter Input : speech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury,” began the prosecutor, “this case has made a stir
Enter Input : throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there so
Enter Input : peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes!
Enter Input : That’s what’s so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us.
Enter Input : What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this
Enter Input : or that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our
Enter Input : lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an
Enter Input : unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of
Enter Input : intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in
Enter Input : spite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their
Enter Input : foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among
Enter Input : us? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and
Enter Input : every citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn
Enter Input : and still timid press has done good service to the public already, for
Enter Input : without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence
Enter Input : and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, not
Enter Input : merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present
Enter Input : reign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of things
Enter Input : beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace.
Enter Input : But what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of
Enter Input : violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us that
Enter Input : it is difficult to contend against it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very
Enter Input : outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of
Enter Input : conscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, and
Enter Input : the servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he could
Enter Input : find on him; ‘it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable
Enter Input : world and for my career in the future.’ After murdering them, he puts
Enter Input : pillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young
Enter Input : hero ‘decorated for bravery’ kills the mother of his chief and benefactor,
Enter Input : like a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that
Enter Input : ‘she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take
Enter Input : no precautions.’ Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in these
Enter Input : days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but will
Enter Input : feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul. In silence, alone
Enter Input : with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, ‘What is honor, and isn’t
Enter Input : the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that
Enter Input : it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say so—and
Enter Input : heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, don’t believe
Enter Input : me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only
Enter Input : a twentieth part of what I say is true—even so it’s awful! Look how our
Enter Input : young people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet’s question
Enter Input : what there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all
Enter Input : that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long
Enter Input : been erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice,
Enter Input : at our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present
Enter Input : case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we
Enter Input : all knew him, ‘he lived among us!’...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe will
Enter Input : study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it. But
Enter Input : this study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydom
Enter Input : of to-day is farther behind us, so that it’s possible to examine it with
Enter Input : more insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now we are either
Enter Input : horrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over the
Enter Input : spectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our
Enter Input : cynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children, we brush the
Enter Input : dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to
Enter Input : our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must one
Enter Input : day begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society;
Enter Input : it’s time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least
Enter Input : to make a beginning in that direction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A great writer(9) of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika
Enter Input : galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, ‘Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who
Enter Input : invented thee!’ and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the
Enter Input : world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping
Enter Input : troika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, but
Enter Input : in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in
Enter Input : an access of childish and naïve optimism, or simply in fear of the
Enter Input : censorship of the day. For if the troika were drawn by his heroes,
Enter Input : Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal,
Enter Input : whoever might be driving it. And those were the heroes of an older
Enter Input : generation, ours are worse specimens still....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch’s speech was interrupted by applause.
Enter Input : The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The applause was,
Enter Input : it’s true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think it
Enter Input : necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction
Enter Input : of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had never
Enter Input : been applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get a hearing,
Enter Input : and now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an
Enter Input : unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?” he continued. “Perhaps I am
Enter Input : exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the
Enter Input : educated class of to-day are reflected in this family picture—only, of
Enter Input : course, in miniature, ‘like the sun in a drop of water.’ Think of that
Enter Input : unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy
Enter Input : end, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor
Enter Input : dependent position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a small
Enter Input : fortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though
Enter Input : undeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew
Enter Input : bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics
Enter Input : disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained.
Enter Input : On the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his vitality was
Enter Input : excessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he brought his
Enter Input : children up to be the same. He had no feelings for his duties as a father.
Enter Input : He ridiculed those duties. He left his little children to the servants,
Enter Input : and was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The old
Enter Input : man’s maxim was _Après moi le déluge_. He was an example of everything
Enter Input : that is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant
Enter Input : individualism. ‘The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all
Enter Input : right,’ and he was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living
Enter Input : in the same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own
Enter Input : son and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get his
Enter Input : mistress from him. No, I don’t intend to leave the prisoner’s defense
Enter Input : altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the
Enter Input : truth myself, I can well understand what resentment he had heaped up in
Enter Input : his son’s heart against him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Let
Enter Input : us remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical fathers
Enter Input : of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of many
Enter Input : modern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professing
Enter Input : such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but their
Enter Input : philosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but
Enter Input : you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not
Enter Input : believe me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember
Enter Input : something of my words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of them
Enter Input : is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him.
Enter Input : Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and
Enter Input : vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied
Enter Input : and rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he was
Enter Input : a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions, quite
Enter Input : the contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him
Enter Input : now, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazov
Enter Input : family. Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his
Enter Input : own hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and
Enter Input : possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the
Enter Input : preliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan
Enter Input : Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. ‘Everything in the
Enter Input : world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in the
Enter Input : future—that is what he always taught me.’ I believe that idiot was driven
Enter Input : out of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks
Enter Input : from which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to
Enter Input : unhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation,
Enter Input : which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is,
Enter Input : indeed, why I’ve mentioned it: ‘If there is one of the sons that is like
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it
Enter Input : indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don’t want to draw any further
Enter Input : conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man’s future. We’ve seen
Enter Input : to-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his young
Enter Input : heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faith
Enter Input : and cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance than by the
Enter Input : exercise of independent thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does not
Enter Input : share his elder brother’s gloomy and destructive theory of life. He has
Enter Input : sought to cling to the ‘ideas of the people,’ or to what goes by that name
Enter Input : in some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery,
Enter Input : and was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed
Enter Input : unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our
Enter Input : unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and
Enter Input : mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return
Enter Input : to their ‘native soil,’ as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their
Enter Input : mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the
Enter Input : withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only
Enter Input : to escape the horrors that terrify them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I
Enter Input : trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the
Enter Input : people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into
Enter Input : gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism—two elements
Enter Input : which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to
Enter Input : misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his
Enter Input : elder brother is suffering.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and
Enter Input : mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own
Enter Input : eloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing
Enter Input : of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive
Enter Input : man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life. People
Enter Input : said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism
Enter Input : of Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of
Enter Input : him in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to
Enter Input : take his revenge. But I don’t know whether it was true. All this was only
Enter Input : introductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct consideration
Enter Input : of the case.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But to return to the eldest son,” Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. “He is
Enter Input : the prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before us;
Enter Input : the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface. While his
Enter Input : brothers seem to stand for ‘Europeanism’ and ‘the principles of the
Enter Input : people,’ he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, not
Enter Input : all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our mother
Enter Input : Russia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a
Enter Input : marvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture and
Enter Input : Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon
Enter Input : companions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only when all goes
Enter Input : well with him. What is more, he can be carried off his feet, positively
Enter Input : carried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves,
Enter Input : if they fall from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He
Enter Input : dislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that’s so
Enter Input : with him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life (he
Enter Input : couldn’t be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he
Enter Input : will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must
Enter Input : have money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with
Enter Input : what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless
Enter Input : dissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he is
Enter Input : ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later,
Enter Input : let us take events in their chronological order.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the
Enter Input : back-yard ‘without boots on his feet,’ as our worthy and esteemed fellow
Enter Input : citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat it
Enter Input : again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse
Enter Input : him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the
Enter Input : influence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and
Enter Input : becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to
Enter Input : one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an
Enter Input : officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so
Enter Input : after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the
Enter Input : last six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he
Enter Input : practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with
Enter Input : his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant
Enter Input : education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just
Enter Input : heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent.
Enter Input : The figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to
Enter Input : true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light
Enter Input : before us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us
Enter Input : immediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture to
Enter Input : conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The same lady,
Enter Input : bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he, he of all
Enter Input : men, had despised her for her action, which, though incautious, reckless
Enter Input : perhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the
Enter Input : girl’s betrothed, looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more
Enter Input : insufferable from him than from any one. And knowing that he had already
Enter Input : deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endure
Enter Input : everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him three
Enter Input : thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that she
Enter Input : was offering him money to deceive her. ‘Well, will you take it or not, are
Enter Input : you so lost to shame?’ was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He
Enter Input : looked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (he’s admitted here before
Enter Input : you that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand
Enter Input : unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of his
Enter Input : affections.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officer
Enter Input : sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing
Enter Input : reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule, between
Enter Input : two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is not
Enter Input : true. The probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble,
Enter Input : and in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broad
Enter Input : Karamazov character—that’s just what I am leading up to—capable of
Enter Input : combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest
Enter Input : heights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by
Enter Input : a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close quarters—Mr.
Enter Input : Rakitin: ‘The sense of their own degradation is as essential to those
Enter Input : reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.’ And
Enter Input : that’s true, they need continually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at
Enter Input : the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their
Enter Input : existence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they
Enter Input : include everything and put up with everything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we’ve just touched upon that three
Enter Input : thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Can
Enter Input : you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a
Enter Input : way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,
Enter Input : could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that
Enter Input : very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the
Enter Input : firmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month
Enter Input : afterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!
Enter Input : Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into the
Enter Input : country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him
Enter Input : to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father,
Enter Input : did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to avoid
Enter Input : abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous, he would
Enter Input : have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to
Enter Input : keep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would say to him at
Enter Input : last ‘I am yours,’ and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he gives
Enter Input : for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she would
Enter Input : say, ‘I am yours, take me where you will,’ he might have the wherewithal
Enter Input : to take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner’s own words, was of
Enter Input : little weight beside the second. While I have that money on me, he said, I
Enter Input : am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed,
Enter Input : and, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can
Enter Input : always say to her, ‘You see, I’ve squandered half your money, and shown I
Enter Input : am a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel’ (I use the
Enter Input : prisoner’s own expressions), ‘but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a
Enter Input : thief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn’t have brought you back this
Enter Input : half of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!’ A
Enter Input : marvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not resist
Enter Input : the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of
Enter Input : such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness,
Enter Input : and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does that
Enter Input : fit in at all with the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture to
Enter Input : tell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such
Enter Input : circumstances, if he really had brought himself to put away the money.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At the first temptation—for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he
Enter Input : had already squandered half the money—he would have unpicked his little
Enter Input : bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he have taken
Enter Input : back precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not
Enter Input : fourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then that he was not a
Enter Input : thief, because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time
Enter Input : he would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then a
Enter Input : third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he would have
Enter Input : taken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundred
Enter Input : it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. And
Enter Input : then he would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself,
Enter Input : ‘It’s really not worth while to give back one hundred; let’s spend that,
Enter Input : too!’ That’s how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would have
Enter Input : behaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact
Enter Input : than this legend of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable.
Enter Input : But we shall return to that later.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the
Enter Input : financial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that it
Enter Input : was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was in
Enter Input : the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical
Enter Input : experts in reference to Mitya’s fixed idea about the three thousand owing
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VII. An Historical Survey
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out
Enter Input : of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that he is in his right
Enter Input : mind, and that if he had not been, he would have behaved more cleverly. As
Enter Input : for his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point,
Enter Input : that is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I think one might
Enter Input : find a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I
Enter Input : agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner’s
Enter Input : mental faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been
Enter Input : irritable and exasperated. The object of the prisoner’s continual and
Enter Input : violent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the
Enter Input : bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner’s fatal passion
Enter Input : for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went to the
Enter Input : “young person’s” lodgings “to beat her”—“I use his own expression,” the
Enter Input : prosecutor explained—“but instead of beating her, he remained there, at
Enter Input : her feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At the same time the
Enter Input : prisoner’s father was captivated by the same young person—a strange and
Enter Input : fatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously,
Enter Input : though both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them the
Enter Input : most violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own
Enter Input : confession: ‘I was laughing at both of them.’ Yes, the sudden desire to
Enter Input : make a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.
Enter Input : The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roubles
Enter Input : as a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he would have
Enter Input : been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet, if only she would
Enter Input : become his lawful wife. We have good evidence of this. As for the
Enter Input : prisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it is before us. But such
Enter Input : was the young person’s ‘game.’ The enchantress gave the unhappy young man
Enter Input : no hope until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out
Enter Input : hands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It
Enter Input : was in that position that he was arrested. ‘Send me to Siberia with him, I
Enter Input : have brought him to this, I am most to blame,’ the woman herself cried, in
Enter Input : genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin,
Enter Input : characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: ‘She was
Enter Input : disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who
Enter Input : seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by her
Enter Input : respectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man,
Enter Input : whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was perhaps
Enter Input : much that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early.
Enter Input : She became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentful
Enter Input : against society.’ After this sketch of her character it may well be
Enter Input : understood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from
Enter Input : malice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he
Enter Input : betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor, the
Enter Input : prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continual
Enter Input : jealousy—and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was that the crazy
Enter Input : old man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means of
Enter Input : that very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his own
Enter Input : property, part of his inheritance from his mother, of which his father was
Enter Input : cheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man
Enter Input : to madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was used
Enter Input : with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his
Enter Input : father had entered the prisoner’s head, and illustrated his theory with
Enter Input : facts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At first he only talked about it in taverns—he was talking about it all
Enter Input : that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and he
Enter Input : likes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical and
Enter Input : dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and expects,
Enter Input : for some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with perfect
Enter Input : sympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his part and not
Enter Input : oppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes up
Enter Input : everything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about Captain
Enter Input : Snegiryov.] Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he
Enter Input : might mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats
Enter Input : into actions.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery,
Enter Input : the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence when
Enter Input : the prisoner had rushed into his father’s house just after dinner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I cannot positively assert,” the prosecutor continued, “that the prisoner
Enter Input : fully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet the idea had
Enter Input : several times presented itself to him, and he had deliberated on it—for
Enter Input : that we have facts, witnesses, and his own words. I confess, gentlemen of
Enter Input : the jury,” he added, “that till to-day I have been uncertain whether to
Enter Input : attribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convinced
Enter Input : that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured
Enter Input : it, contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered
Enter Input : when and how he might commit the crime.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was
Enter Input : presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young lady’s
Enter Input : exclamation, ‘It is the plan, the program of the murder!’ That is how she
Enter Input : defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner. And, in
Enter Input : fact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was
Enter Input : premeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now for a
Enter Input : fact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible
Enter Input : design, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money next day, he
Enter Input : would murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes from
Enter Input : under his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. ‘As soon as Ivan had gone
Enter Input : away’—you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every
Enter Input : circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it. The
Enter Input : proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committed
Enter Input : for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written and
Enter Input : signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not diminish
Enter Input : the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when drunk what he
Enter Input : had planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober, he would not
Enter Input : have written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did he talk about
Enter Input : it in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it
Enter Input : to himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when
Enter Input : he had only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less
Enter Input : about it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the ‘Metropolis’ tavern,
Enter Input : contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking. He did
Enter Input : not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He did indeed
Enter Input : turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost unconsciously,
Enter Input : because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance. It is
Enter Input : true that after he had taken the final decision, he must have felt
Enter Input : apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand, and
Enter Input : that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But there
Enter Input : was nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck had
Enter Input : served him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his star, you
Enter Input : know! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal
Enter Input : catastrophe. ‘To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,’
Enter Input : as he writes in his peculiar language, ‘and if they won’t give it to me,
Enter Input : there will be bloodshed.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya’s
Enter Input : efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to Samsonov, his
Enter Input : journey to Lyagavy. “Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his watch
Enter Input : to pay for the journey (though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles
Enter Input : on him—a likely story), tortured by jealousy at having left the object of
Enter Input : his affections in the town, suspecting that she would go to Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last to the town, to find, to
Enter Input : his joy, that she had not been near his father. He accompanied her himself
Enter Input : to her protector. (Strange to say, he doesn’t seem to have been jealous of
Enter Input : Samsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to
Enter Input : his ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a
Enter Input : fit, that the other servant is ill—the coast is clear and he knows the
Enter Input : ‘signals’—what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady
Enter Input : who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly
Enter Input : esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his
Enter Input : career with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his
Enter Input : dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth and
Enter Input : vigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the
Enter Input : gold-mines: ‘that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your
Enter Input : romantic character, your thirst for adventure.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the
Enter Input : prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov’s, the sudden
Enter Input : frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion,
Enter Input : at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father,
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of
Enter Input : chance. “Had the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her
Enter Input : former lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, she
Enter Input : could only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did not
Enter Input : kill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false
Enter Input : mistress.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why that?
Enter Input : Why not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating his plan
Enter Input : and preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would snatch up
Enter Input : anything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized for a month
Enter Input : past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly,
Enter Input : without hesitation, recognized that it would serve his purpose. So it was
Enter Input : by no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up
Enter Input : that fatal pestle. And then we find him in his father’s garden—the coast
Enter Input : is clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicion
Enter Input : that she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhaps
Enter Input : laughing at him at that moment—took his breath away. And it was not mere
Enter Input : suspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must be there, in that
Enter Input : lighted room, she must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man would
Enter Input : have us believe that he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in,
Enter Input : and discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should
Enter Input : happen. And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his
Enter Input : character, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he knew the
Enter Input : signals by which he could at once enter the house.” At this point Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of
Enter Input : Smerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and every
Enter Input : one realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion, he
Enter Input : thought the subject of great importance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?” (Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch began.) “The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had
Enter Input : committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest,
Enter Input : yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to
Enter Input : confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is
Enter Input : confirmed by three persons only—the two brothers of the prisoner and
Enter Input : Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only
Enter Input : to-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know
Enter Input : that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of
Enter Input : his brother’s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that
Enter Input : later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact
Enter Input : to support his notion of Smerdyakov’s guilt, and has only been led to that
Enter Input : conclusion from the prisoner’s own words and the expression of his face.
Enter Input : Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice
Enter Input : to-day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. ‘What the
Enter Input : prisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.’ That
Enter Input : is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons,
Enter Input : who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner’s fate. And yet the theory of
Enter Input : Smerdyakov’s guilt has been noised about, has been and is still
Enter Input : maintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality
Enter Input : of Smerdyakov, “who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.” He
Enter Input : depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education,
Enter Input : who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his level
Enter Input : and certain modern theories of duty, which he learnt in practice from the
Enter Input : reckless life of his master, who was also perhaps his father—Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophical
Enter Input : conversations with his master’s elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily
Enter Input : indulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse
Enter Input : himself at the valet’s expense. “He spoke to me himself of his spiritual
Enter Input : condition during the last few days at his father’s house,” Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch explained; “but others too have borne witness to it—the
Enter Input : prisoner himself, his brother, and the servant Grigory—that is, all who
Enter Input : knew him well.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy,
Enter Input : had not the courage of a chicken. ‘He fell at my feet and kissed them,’
Enter Input : the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how damaging such a
Enter Input : statement was to himself. ‘He is an epileptic chicken,’ he declared about
Enter Input : him in his characteristic language. And the prisoner chose him for his
Enter Input : confidant (we have his own word for it) and he frightened him into
Enter Input : consenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that capacity he deceived
Enter Input : his master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with
Enter Input : the notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into the
Enter Input : house. How could he help telling him, indeed? ‘He would have killed me, I
Enter Input : could see that he would have killed me,’ he said at the inquiry, trembling
Enter Input : and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time arrested
Enter Input : and could do him no harm. ‘He suspected me at every instant. In fear and
Enter Input : trembling I hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he might
Enter Input : see that I had not deceived him and let me off alive.’ Those are his own
Enter Input : words. I wrote them down and I remember them. ‘When he began shouting at
Enter Input : me, I would fall on my knees.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his
Enter Input : master, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So it may
Enter Input : be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having
Enter Input : deceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons severely
Enter Input : afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, always
Enter Input : prone to continual and morbid self-reproach. They worry over their
Enter Input : ‘wickedness,’ they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely
Enter Input : without cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and
Enter Input : crimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to
Enter Input : wrong-doing by terror and intimidation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would be
Enter Input : the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes. When
Enter Input : Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid to tell him
Enter Input : plainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints were
Enter Input : not understood.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector,
Enter Input : whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to
Enter Input : pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov’s drunken letter, ‘I shall
Enter Input : kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.’ So Ivan Fyodorovitch’s presence
Enter Input : seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he went away, and within an hour of his young master’s departure
Enter Input : Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that’s perfectly
Enter Input : intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror and
Enter Input : despair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of the
Enter Input : fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might be
Enter Input : coming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of
Enter Input : course, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is
Enter Input : likely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his
Enter Input : lonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the
Enter Input : stairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to
Enter Input : come upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,
Enter Input : brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks, and
Enter Input : he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly natural
Enter Input : occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was shamming
Enter Input : an attack _on purpose_. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises at
Enter Input : once, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on? What was he aiming
Enter Input : at? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the
Enter Input : doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the
Enter Input : real. That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for
Enter Input : such a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, have
Enter Input : desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just
Enter Input : before?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were
Enter Input : five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s—Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he did
Enter Input : not kill himself, that’s evident); then his servant, Grigory, but he was
Enter Input : almost killed himself; the third person was Grigory’s wife, Marfa
Enter Input : Ignatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering her
Enter Input : master. Two persons are left—the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are
Enter Input : to believe the prisoner’s statement that he is not the murderer, then
Enter Input : Smerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else
Enter Input : can be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation
Enter Input : against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday. Had a shadow of
Enter Input : suspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I am
Enter Input : persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to charge
Enter Input : Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let us
Enter Input : even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts
Enter Input : tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or with the
Enter Input : assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternative—that he
Enter Input : did it alone. If he had killed him it must have been with some object, for
Enter Input : some advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the
Enter Input : prisoner had for the murder—hatred, jealousy, and so on—Smerdyakov could
Enter Input : only have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the
Enter Input : three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yet
Enter Input : he tells another person—and a person most closely interested, that is, the
Enter Input : prisoner—everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope
Enter Input : lay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all,
Enter Input : told him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do
Enter Input : this simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who
Enter Input : would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? ‘Yes,’ I shall be told,
Enter Input : ‘but he betrayed it from fear.’ But how do you explain this? A man who
Enter Input : could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells
Enter Input : facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held
Enter Input : his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, nothing
Enter Input : would have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals,
Enter Input : for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He would have
Enter Input : invented something, he would have told some lie if he had been forced to
Enter Input : give information, but he would have been silent about that. For, on the
Enter Input : other hand, if he had said nothing about the money, but had committed the
Enter Input : murder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged him
Enter Input : with murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the
Enter Input : money, no one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had
Enter Input : been accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had
Enter Input : committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed any
Enter Input : such motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, that
Enter Input : his master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence, he would,
Enter Input : of course, have been the last to be suspected. People would have suspected
Enter Input : first the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he had such
Enter Input : motives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected
Enter Input : the son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed
Enter Input : and robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course,
Enter Input : have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the
Enter Input : murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the
Enter Input : signals? Is that logical? Is that clear?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him
Enter Input : falling downstairs in a _feigned_ fit—with what object? In the first place
Enter Input : that Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might put it
Enter Input : off and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house,
Enter Input : and, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing that there was
Enter Input : no one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his son, might redouble
Enter Input : his vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where
Enter Input : he always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and out
Enter Input : as he liked, to Grigory’s room at the other end of the lodge, where he was
Enter Input : always put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This was
Enter Input : the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted Marfa
Enter Input : Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying behind the screen, he
Enter Input : would most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and so
Enter Input : keeping them awake all night (as Grigory and his wife testified). And all
Enter Input : this, we are to believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murder
Enter Input : his master!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not
Enter Input : be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals to
Enter Input : tempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him and had gone
Enter Input : away with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people,
Enter Input : Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in—what for? To murder his
Enter Input : master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen?
Enter Input : Gentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,
Enter Input : but, incredible as it seems, that’s just what the prisoner alleges. When
Enter Input : he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, he
Enter Input : tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his master and stole the
Enter Input : money! I won’t press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned
Enter Input : on this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son
Enter Input : would simply come to peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and
Enter Input : beat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put
Enter Input : this question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could
Enter Input : have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can’t accuse him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,
Enter Input : heard a shout, and went out. Well—what then? He looked about him and said,
Enter Input : ‘Why not go and kill the master?’ And how did he know what had happened,
Enter Input : since he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But there’s a limit
Enter Input : to these flights of fancy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Quite so,’ some astute people will tell me, ‘but what if they were in
Enter Input : agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the money—what
Enter Input : then?’ A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are
Enter Input : astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his
Enter Input : accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion
Enter Input : in every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would be
Enter Input : interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to
Enter Input : form such an insane plan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov’s part,
Enter Input : but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and
Enter Input : agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamed
Enter Input : for letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help or
Enter Input : resisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get
Enter Input : out of the way by shamming a fit—‘you may murder him as you like; it’s
Enter Input : nothing to me.’ But as this attack of Smerdyakov’s was bound to throw the
Enter Input : household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such
Enter Input : a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, it
Enter Input : would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the
Enter Input : instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an
Enter Input : accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly
Enter Input : throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being his
Enter Input : accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. ‘He did it alone,’ he says.
Enter Input : ‘He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.’ Strange sort
Enter Input : of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of the
Enter Input : risk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while his accomplice lay
Enter Input : in bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented
Enter Input : it and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he
Enter Input : might well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was
Enter Input : responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished,
Enter Input : it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But in that case he
Enter Input : would have been certain to make a confession, yet he has not done so.
Enter Input : Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murderer
Enter Input : persisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crime
Enter Input : alone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What’s more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it
Enter Input : was _he_ who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the
Enter Input : signals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about them. If
Enter Input : he had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily have made this
Enter Input : statement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to conceal
Enter Input : it, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was far from distorting
Enter Input : or minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being
Enter Input : charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit of
Enter Input : melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himself
Enter Input : yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language, ‘I destroy
Enter Input : myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.’
Enter Input : What would it have cost him to add: ‘I am the murderer, not Karamazov’?
Enter Input : But that he did not add. Did his conscience lead him to suicide and not to
Enter Input : avowing his guilt?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the
Enter Input : court just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in the
Enter Input : envelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had received
Enter Input : them from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the painful
Enter Input : scene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones
Enter Input : as might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be
Enter Input : overlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money
Enter Input : and hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessed
Enter Input : his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so,
Enter Input : indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? And so,
Enter Input : if he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow the whole
Enter Input : truth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the innocent
Enter Input : prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came
Enter Input : to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousand
Enter Input : each—that is, ten thousand in all—to the chief town of the province to be
Enter Input : changed. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and
Enter Input : that it can’t be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch’s envelope.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such
Enter Input : importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn’t he report it
Enter Input : at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to
Enter Input : conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had
Enter Input : admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was
Enter Input : suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on
Enter Input : the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down
Enter Input : to-day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov’s death, and at
Enter Input : once reflected, ‘The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my
Enter Input : brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov
Enter Input : gave them me before his death.’ You will say that was dishonorable: it’s
Enter Input : dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True,
Enter Input : but what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by
Enter Input : the sudden news of the valet’s death, he imagined it really was so? You
Enter Input : saw the recent scene: you have seen the witness’s condition. He was
Enter Input : standing up and was speaking, but where was his mind?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then followed the document, the prisoner’s letter written two days before
Enter Input : the crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why, then, are
Enter Input : we looking for any other program? The crime was committed precisely
Enter Input : according to this program, and by no other than the writer of it. Yes,
Enter Input : gentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not run
Enter Input : respectfully and timidly away from his father’s window, though he was
Enter Input : firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him. No, that
Enter Input : is absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed
Enter Input : him in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated
Enter Input : rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass pestle,
Enter Input : and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she was not
Enter Input : there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the pillow and
Enter Input : take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the table
Enter Input : before us.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very
Enter Input : characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and had
Enter Input : he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have left the
Enter Input : torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse? Had it been
Enter Input : Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him, he would have
Enter Input : simply carried away the envelope with him, without troubling himself to
Enter Input : open it over his victim’s corpse, for he would have known for certain that
Enter Input : the notes were in the envelope—they had been put in and sealed up in his
Enter Input : presence—and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have
Enter Input : known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved
Enter Input : in that way? Would he have left the envelope on the floor?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not a
Enter Input : thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes from
Enter Input : under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizing
Enter Input : his own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was the idea
Enter Input : which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard
Enter Input : to that money. And pouncing upon the envelope, which he had never seen
Enter Input : before, he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran
Enter Input : away with the money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had
Enter Input : left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope
Enter Input : on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he didn’t
Enter Input : think, he didn’t reflect, and how should he? He ran away; he heard behind
Enter Input : him the servant cry out; the old man caught him, stopped him and was
Enter Input : felled to the ground by the brass pestle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you believe
Enter Input : it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to see
Enter Input : whether he could do anything for him. Was that a moment to show
Enter Input : compassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only
Enter Input : witness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other feeling, any other
Enter Input : motive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped
Enter Input : his head with his handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran
Enter Input : to the house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it he
Enter Input : never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once
Enter Input : detected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice
Enter Input : that he was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very
Enter Input : possible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On one point
Enter Input : they will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape them
Enter Input : altogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one thing only—where was
Enter Input : _she_? He wanted to find out at once where she was, so he ran to her
Enter Input : lodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news—she had gone
Enter Input : off to Mokroe to meet her first lover.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor’s Speech.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition,
Enter Input : beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on
Enter Input : their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his speech he went off into a
Enter Input : dissertation on Grushenka’s “first lover,” and brought forward several
Enter Input : interesting thoughts on this theme.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, so
Enter Input : to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What makes
Enter Input : it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this
Enter Input : formidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote danger, and
Enter Input : Karamazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded him as a
Enter Input : fiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been
Enter Input : concealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but a
Enter Input : fiction to her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this
Enter Input : instantly, he resigned himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in
Enter Input : the prisoner’s character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for
Enter Input : justice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love. And
Enter Input : all this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with his
Enter Input : father’s blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had shed was
Enter Input : already crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul and
Enter Input : his life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instant
Enter Input : what he was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him
Enter Input : than his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned
Enter Input : penitent, with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with honorable
Enter Input : offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life. And he, luckless
Enter Input : man, what could he give her now, what could he offer her?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by his
Enter Input : crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with life
Enter Input : before him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to one
Enter Input : frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov’s character, must have appeared
Enter Input : the one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way out was
Enter Input : suicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friend
Enter Input : Perhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money,
Enter Input : for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father’s gore. Oh,
Enter Input : now he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
Enter Input : shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a poet and
Enter Input : had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. ‘To her, to her! and
Enter Input : there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never was
Enter Input : before, that will be remembered and talked of long after! In the midst of
Enter Input : shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise
Enter Input : the glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness! And
Enter Input : then, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and
Enter Input : punish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see
Enter Input : how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and
Enter Input : sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but
Enter Input : there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out
Enter Input : in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto
Enter Input : death—that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment,
Enter Input : its terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is
Enter Input : the only way out! But _beyond_—I don’t know whether Karamazov wondered at
Enter Input : that moment ‘What lies beyond,’ and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet,
Enter Input : wonder ‘What lies beyond.’ No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their
Enter Input : Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya’s preparations,
Enter Input : the scene at Perhotin’s, at the shop, with the drivers. He quoted numerous
Enter Input : words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terrible
Enter Input : impression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man
Enter Input : stood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost confessed,
Enter Input : hinted at it, all but spoke out.” (Then followed the evidence given by
Enter Input : witnesses.) “He even cried out to the peasant who drove him, ‘Do you know,
Enter Input : you are driving a murderer!’ But it was impossible for him to speak out,
Enter Input : he had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his romance. But what was
Enter Input : awaiting the luckless man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw
Enter Input : that his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the
Enter Input : toast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be
Enter Input : acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the
Enter Input : preliminary inquiry. Karamazov’s triumph over his rival was complete and
Enter Input : his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phase
Enter Input : through which his soul has passed or will pass.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,” the prosecutor
Enter Input : continued, “that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own
Enter Input : vengeance more completely than any earthly justice. What’s more, justice
Enter Input : and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and
Enter Input : are, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as its
Enter Input : salvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror and moral
Enter Input : suffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him, that for his
Enter Input : sake she had rejected her first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya,
Enter Input : to a new life, that she was promising him happiness—and when? When
Enter Input : everything was over for him and nothing was possible!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the
Enter Input : light it throws on the prisoner’s position at the moment. This woman, this
Enter Input : love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant of his
Enter Input : arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him but
Enter Input : unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he relinquish
Enter Input : his design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just that
Enter Input : passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained
Enter Input : him. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress, who was
Enter Input : at the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than
Enter Input : ever—he did not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest,
Enter Input : but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for a moment!
Enter Input : I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by
Enter Input : these influences—first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement,
Enter Input : of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her, flushed
Enter Input : with wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in
Enter Input : the background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till
Enter Input : next morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a few
Enter Input : hours and that’s much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many
Enter Input : things. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when
Enter Input : they are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street
Enter Input : to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then there
Enter Input : will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street
Enter Input : the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning of the journey
Enter Input : the condemned man, sitting on his shameful cart, must feel that he has
Enter Input : infinite life still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves on—oh,
Enter Input : that’s nothing, it’s still far to the turning into the second street and
Enter Input : he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously
Enter Input : curious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that he
Enter Input : is just such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street.
Enter Input : Oh, that’s nothing, nothing, there’s still a whole street before him, and
Enter Input : however many houses have been passed, he will still think there are many
Enter Input : left. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. ‘They’ve not had time
Enter Input : yet,’ he must have thought, ‘I may still find some way out, oh, there’s
Enter Input : still time to make some plan of defense, and now, now—she is so
Enter Input : fascinating!’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to put
Enter Input : aside half his money and hide it somewhere—I cannot otherwise explain the
Enter Input : disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken from
Enter Input : his father’s pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than once before, he had
Enter Input : caroused there for two days together already, he knew the old big house
Enter Input : with all its passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money
Enter Input : was hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice,
Enter Input : under some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I
Enter Input : shall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he
Enter Input : hadn’t yet considered how to meet it, he hadn’t the time, his head was
Enter Input : throbbing and his heart was with _her_, but money—money was indispensable
Enter Input : in any case! With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at
Enter Input : such a moment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself that
Enter Input : a month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his money
Enter Input : and sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall
Enter Input : prove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had
Enter Input : contemplated it. What’s more, when he declared at the inquiry that he had
Enter Input : put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed) he may have
Enter Input : invented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he had
Enter Input : two hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at Mokroe till
Enter Input : morning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself. Two
Enter Input : extremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate
Enter Input : two extremes and both at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We have looked in the house, but we haven’t found the money. It may still
Enter Input : be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner’s
Enter Input : hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees before her, she
Enter Input : was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to her and he had so
Enter Input : entirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the men coming to
Enter Input : arrest him. He hadn’t time to prepare any line of defense in his mind. He
Enter Input : was caught unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his
Enter Input : destiny.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our duties
Enter Input : when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his account, too!
Enter Input : The moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees that
Enter Input : all is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the moments
Enter Input : when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he
Enter Input : looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face,
Enter Input : your thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his distracted
Enter Input : mind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to
Enter Input : speak, afraid of giving himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this
Enter Input : animal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the
Enter Input : human soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the
Enter Input : criminal even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very
Enter Input : compromising phrases. ‘Blood! I’ve deserved it!’ But he quickly restrained
Enter Input : himself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer he was to
Enter Input : make, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. ‘I am not guilty of my
Enter Input : father’s death.’ That was his fence for the moment and behind it he hoped
Enter Input : to throw up a barricade of some sort. His first compromising exclamations
Enter Input : he hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death
Enter Input : of the servant Grigory only. ‘Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has
Enter Input : killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him,
Enter Input : _if not I_?’ Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask him
Enter Input : that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature
Enter Input : haste—‘if not I’—the animal cunning, the naïveté, the Karamazov impatience
Enter Input : of it? ‘I didn’t kill him and you mustn’t think I did! I wanted to kill
Enter Input : him, gentlemen, I wanted to kill him,’ he hastens to admit (he was in a
Enter Input : hurry, in a terrible hurry), ‘but still I am not guilty, it is not I
Enter Input : murdered him.’ He concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though
Enter Input : to say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you’ll believe
Enter Input : all the sooner that I didn’t murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is
Enter Input : often amazingly shallow and credulous.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally, the
Enter Input : most simple question, ‘Wasn’t it Smerdyakov killed him?’ Then, as we
Enter Input : expected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught
Enter Input : him unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the
Enter Input : moment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov’s name. He
Enter Input : rushed at once to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to
Enter Input : assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of
Enter Input : it. But don’t believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn’t really
Enter Input : give up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him
Enter Input : forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but he
Enter Input : would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him.
Enter Input : He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later,
Enter Input : choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, ‘You know I was more skeptical
Enter Input : about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I am
Enter Input : convinced. He killed him, he must have done!’ And for the present he falls
Enter Input : back upon a gloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted
Enter Input : him, however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he
Enter Input : looked into his father’s window and how he respectfully withdrew. The
Enter Input : worst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the
Enter Input : evidence given by Grigory.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him, the
Enter Input : whole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it. And no
Enter Input : doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bag
Enter Input : first occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of the
Enter Input : improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more
Enter Input : likely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In such
Enter Input : cases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is to
Enter Input : prevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly so
Enter Input : that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity,
Enter Input : improbability and inconsistency. The criminal can only be made to speak by
Enter Input : the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of
Enter Input : some circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had no
Enter Input : previous idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in
Enter Input : readiness—that was Grigory’s evidence about the open door through which
Enter Input : the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about that door and
Enter Input : had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, ‘Then
Enter Input : Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!’ and so betrayed the basis of
Enter Input : the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbable
Enter Input : shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had
Enter Input : knocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that Grigory saw the
Enter Input : door was open before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the
Enter Input : screen as he came out of his bedroom—Karamazov was positively crushed. My
Enter Input : esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards
Enter Input : that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improve
Enter Input : matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little
Enter Input : bag—so be it, you shall hear this romance!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this
Enter Input : romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that
Enter Input : could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for a
Enter Input : bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything more
Enter Input : incredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can
Enter Input : always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real
Enter Input : life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers
Enter Input : neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for
Enter Input : such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a
Enter Input : whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that’s
Enter Input : how they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, ‘Where did you
Enter Input : get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?’ ‘I made it
Enter Input : myself.’ ‘And where did you get the linen?’ The prisoner was positively
Enter Input : offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial
Enter Input : question, and would you believe it, his resentment was genuine! But they
Enter Input : are all like that. ‘I tore it off my shirt.’ ‘Then we shall find that
Enter Input : shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece torn off.’ And only fancy,
Enter Input : gentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and how
Enter Input : could we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that
Enter Input : would have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! But
Enter Input : he was incapable of that reflection. ‘I don’t remember, it may not have
Enter Input : been off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady’s caps.’ ‘What sort
Enter Input : of a cap?’ ‘It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.’ ‘And do you
Enter Input : remember that clearly?’ ‘No, I don’t.’ And he was angry, very angry, and
Enter Input : yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments of man’s
Enter Input : life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers just
Enter Input : such trifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed
Enter Input : past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross—that he will remember. He
Enter Input : concealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must have
Enter Input : remembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him
Enter Input : needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen
Enter Input : (there is a screen in his lodgings).
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these
Enter Input : details, trifles?” cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. “Just because the
Enter Input : prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has not
Enter Input : explained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has not added
Enter Input : one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements; all those
Enter Input : are trivialities. ‘You must believe it on my honor.’ Oh, we are glad to
Enter Input : believe it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honor!
Enter Input : Are we jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in the
Enter Input : prisoner’s favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real
Enter Input : fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner’s expression by his own
Enter Input : brother, or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to
Enter Input : point to the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new
Enter Input : fact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to
Enter Input : repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot
Enter Input : repudiate anything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as though
Enter Input : he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the
Enter Input : blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery!
Enter Input : He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for
Enter Input : the defense,” Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, “whatever
Enter Input : eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember
Enter Input : that at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you are
Enter Input : the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her
Enter Input : principles, her family, everything that she holds sacred! Yes, you
Enter Input : represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not
Enter Input : in this hall only but will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all
Enter Input : Russia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be
Enter Input : encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and
Enter Input : her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight
Enter Input : perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched
Enter Input : out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. And
Enter Input : if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from
Enter Input : respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. From
Enter Input : horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, but
Enter Input : maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall
Enter Input : confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of
Enter Input : our lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and
Enter Input : civilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they
Enter Input : already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing
Enter Input : hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech
Enter Input : with this rhetorical appeal—and the effect produced by him was
Enter Input : extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and,
Enter Input : as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room. There
Enter Input : was no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. The ladies
Enter Input : were not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with his
Enter Input : eloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the
Enter Input : trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. “He will speak at last and of
Enter Input : course carry all before him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the
Enter Input : prosecutor’s speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and his
Enter Input : head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened,
Enter Input : especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the prosecutor mentioned
Enter Input : Rakitin’s opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over his
Enter Input : face and he murmured rather audibly, “The Bernards!” When Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe,
Enter Input : Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At one point he
Enter Input : seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only
Enter Input : shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end
Enter Input : of the speech, of the prosecutor’s feat in examining the prisoner at
Enter Input : Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. “The man could not resist
Enter Input : boasting of his cleverness,” they said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an
Enter Input : hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and
Enter Input : exclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A weighty speech,” a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He brought in too much psychology,” said another voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But it was all true, the absolute truth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he is first rate at it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He summed it all up.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he summed us up, too,” chimed in another voice. “Do you remember, at
Enter Input : the beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And at the end, too. But that was all rot.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And obscure too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was a little too much carried away.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s unjust, it’s unjust.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it was smartly done, anyway. He’s had long to wait, but he’s had his
Enter Input : say, ha ha!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What will the counsel for the defense say?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In another group I heard:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that;
Enter Input : ‘appealing to your sensibilities’—do you remember?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, that was awkward of him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He was in too great a hurry.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a nervous man.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, what must it be for Mitya?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a third group:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the end?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She is a general’s wife, divorced, I know her.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s why she has the lorgnette.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She is not good for much.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn’t they, eh?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, it was smart enough. We’ve heard it before, how often he has told the
Enter Input : story at people’s houses!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And he couldn’t resist doing it now. That’s vanity.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a man with a grievance, he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, such
Enter Input : long sentences.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you remember
Enter Input : about the troika? Something about ‘They have Hamlets, but we have, so far,
Enter Input : only Karamazovs!’ That was cleverly said!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Whatever he says, he won’t get round our peasants.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t you think so?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A fourth group:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the other
Enter Input : nations.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speaking
Enter Input : about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to
Enter Input : intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of him,
Enter Input : I know he was. He was talking about that last week.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not an easy job.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not an easy job? Why not?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, we’d shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where would
Enter Input : they get it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “In America. They get it from America now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nonsense!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted the
Enter Input : tribune.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The eyes
Enter Input : of the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and directly,
Enter Input : with an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit. He made
Enter Input : no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a
Enter Input : man speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice
Enter Input : was a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine
Enter Input : and simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that
Enter Input : the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and “pierce the heart
Enter Input : with untold power.” His language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit
Enter Input : Kirillovitch’s, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with more
Enter Input : precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending forward,
Enter Input : especially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but as
Enter Input : though he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long spine in
Enter Input : half, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bend
Enter Input : almost at right angles.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, without
Enter Input : system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end,
Enter Input : these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts,
Enter Input : the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimes
Enter Input : malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly changed his
Enter Input : tone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed
Enter Input : on the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he
Enter Input : practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns to
Enter Input : defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least a
Enter Input : preconceived idea. “That is what has happened to me in the present case,”
Enter Input : he explained. “From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck
Enter Input : by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner’s favor. What
Enter Input : interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but
Enter Input : rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present
Enter Input : case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech,
Enter Input : but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to
Enter Input : work directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my
Enter Input : material. That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it’s sincere.
Enter Input : What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence
Enter Input : against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will stand
Enter Input : criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the case more
Enter Input : closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly
Enter Input : received from the prisoner’s relatives a request to undertake his defense.
Enter Input : I at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to
Enter Input : break down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of
Enter Input : evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the
Enter Input : case.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So Fetyukovitch began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury,” he suddenly protested, “I am new to this
Enter Input : district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulent
Enter Input : and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has insulted perhaps
Enter Input : hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people against
Enter Input : him beforehand. Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of local
Enter Input : society is justly excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent and
Enter Input : violent temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcome
Enter Input : in the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,
Enter Input : quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the prosecutor
Enter Input : received Mitya against his will, solely because he had somehow interested
Enter Input : his wife—a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful,
Enter Input : capricious, and fond of opposing her husband, especially in trifles.
Enter Input : Mitya’s visits, however, had not been frequent.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Nevertheless I venture to suggest,” Fetyukovitch continued, “that in
Enter Input : spite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may have
Enter Input : formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client. Oh, that is so
Enter Input : natural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice.
Enter Input : Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless. We
Enter Input : have, in the talented prosecutor’s speech, heard a stern analysis of the
Enter Input : prisoner’s character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the
Enter Input : case was evident. And, what’s more, he went into psychological subtleties
Enter Input : into which he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and
Enter Input : malicious prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are
Enter Input : even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious and
Enter Input : consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away by the
Enter Input : artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance,
Enter Input : especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight. Before I
Enter Input : started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware,
Enter Input : that I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight
Enter Input : and subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recent
Enter Input : years. But profound as psychology is, it’s a knife that cuts both ways.”
Enter Input : (Laughter among the public.) “You will, of course, forgive me my
Enter Input : comparison; I can’t boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example any
Enter Input : point in the prosecutor’s speech.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the
Enter Input : fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass
Enter Input : pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over
Enter Input : the man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the
Enter Input : prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner’s statement that he ran to old
Enter Input : Grigory out of pity. ‘No,’ he says, ‘such sensibility is impossible at
Enter Input : such a moment, that’s unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only
Enter Input : witness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had
Enter Input : committed the murder, since he would not have run back for any other
Enter Input : reason.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to
Enter Input : the case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable. The
Enter Input : murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whether
Enter Input : the witness was alive or not, yet he had left in his murdered father’s
Enter Input : study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence in
Enter Input : the shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had been
Enter Input : three thousand roubles in it. ‘If he had carried that envelope away with
Enter Input : him, no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the
Enter Input : notes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.’ Those
Enter Input : are the prosecutor’s own words. So on one side you see a complete absence
Enter Input : of precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright,
Enter Input : leaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed
Enter Input : another man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating
Enter Input : foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological
Enter Input : subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances I
Enter Input : become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the
Enter Input : next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and
Enter Input : cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out
Enter Input : whether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutes
Enter Input : looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Why
Enter Input : soak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may be
Enter Input : evidence against me later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why
Enter Input : not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as
Enter Input : to kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left
Enter Input : another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from the
Enter Input : two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and
Enter Input : prove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he had
Enter Input : forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he
Enter Input : had flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where
Enter Input : Grigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at having
Enter Input : killed a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse,
Enter Input : as a murderous weapon. That’s how it must have been, what other reason
Enter Input : could he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling
Enter Input : grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent of
Enter Input : his father’s murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run to
Enter Input : another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; his
Enter Input : thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation. He would have had
Enter Input : none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would
Enter Input : have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him.
Enter Input : There was room for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience had
Enter Input : been clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have
Enter Input : purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you
Enter Input : can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.
Enter Input : Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite
Enter Input : unconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were
Enter Input : again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I will
Enter Input : only quote some passages from it, some leading points.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch’s speech. He
Enter Input : flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and
Enter Input : consequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury,” he began. “Every new and unprejudiced observer
Enter Input : must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case,
Enter Input : namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of proving
Enter Input : that there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money was
Enter Input : stolen—three thousand roubles—but whether those roubles ever existed,
Enter Input : nobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seen
Enter Input : the notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been put
Enter Input : in the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the
Enter Input : prisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe.
Enter Input : Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three
Enter Input : persons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here the question arises, if it’s true that they did exist, and that
Enter Input : Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What if
Enter Input : his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his
Enter Input : cash-box without telling him? Note, that according to Smerdyakov’s story
Enter Input : the notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner must have pulled them
Enter Input : out, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded
Enter Input : in the protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes without
Enter Input : disturbing the bed? How could he have helped soiling with his
Enter Input : blood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had
Enter Input : been purposely made?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, it’s
Enter Input : worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprised
Enter Input : just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself—of
Enter Input : himself, observe—that but for that envelope, but for its being left on the
Enter Input : floor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of that
Enter Input : envelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisoner’s having
Enter Input : stolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor’s own
Enter Input : admission, the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, ‘otherwise
Enter Input : no one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.’
Enter Input : But is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a
Enter Input : proof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
Enter Input : Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope.
Enter Input : But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talked
Enter Input : to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen the notes two days before
Enter Input : the catastrophe. Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked
Enter Input : up alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his
Enter Input : adoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and
Enter Input : taking out the notes. ‘What’s the use of the envelope?’ he may have asked
Enter Input : himself. ‘She won’t believe the notes are there, but when I show her the
Enter Input : thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression,
Enter Input : you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.’ And so he tears open the
Enter Input : envelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor,
Enter Input : conscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving
Enter Input : evidence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and
Enter Input : such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the sort
Enter Input : could have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; if
Enter Input : there was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the floor
Enter Input : may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I not
Enter Input : maintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because the
Enter Input : money had been taken from it by its owner?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch took
Enter Input : it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the
Enter Input : house? In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box,
Enter Input : and secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or the evening
Enter Input : before to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he may have
Enter Input : changed his idea, his plan of action completely, without thinking it
Enter Input : necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is
Enter Input : the barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so
Enter Input : positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and
Enter Input : of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on the
Enter Input : domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has been stolen, the
Enter Input : thing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond
Enter Input : doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a
Enter Input : boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad
Enter Input : daylight into a moneychanger’s shop with an ax, and with extraordinary,
Enter Input : typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen
Enter Input : hundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteen
Enter Input : roubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him.
Enter Input : Moreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder,
Enter Input : informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the
Enter Input : notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notes
Enter Input : and coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and
Enter Input : genuine confession on the part of the murderer. That’s what I call
Enter Input : evidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch the
Enter Input : money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present case?
Enter Input : And yet it is a question of life and death.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering money;
Enter Input : he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles—where did he get the
Enter Input : money? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and the
Enter Input : other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that money
Enter Input : was not the same, and had never been in any envelope. By strict
Enter Input : calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the
Enter Input : prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin’s without
Enter Input : going home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in
Enter Input : company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half
Enter Input : and hidden half in the town. It’s just this consideration that has led the
Enter Input : prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe.
Enter Input : Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn’t this
Enter Input : supposition really too fantastic and too romantic? And observe, if that
Enter Input : supposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the
Enter Input : winds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen
Enter Input : hundred roubles? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since it’s
Enter Input : proved the prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man’s
Enter Input : life with such tales!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen
Enter Input : hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money before
Enter Input : that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear and
Enter Input : unflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have it
Enter Input : so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that
Enter Input : statement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner.
Enter Input : The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak will, who
Enter Input : had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by
Enter Input : his betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up,
Enter Input : but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two days and
Enter Input : taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this,
Enter Input : you will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no
Enter Input : contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What if
Enter Input : you’ve been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man?
Enter Input : That’s just it, you have invented quite a different man!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day
Enter Input : all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the
Enter Input : catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are
Enter Input : these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court
Enter Input : already. Besides, in another man’s hand a crust always seems larger, and
Enter Input : no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at
Enter Input : sight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty
Enter Input : thousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a
Enter Input : two-edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. But the question
Enter Input : is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting and
Enter Input : degrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first statement made by the
Enter Input : young lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In the
Enter Input : second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of
Enter Input : long-concealed hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her first
Enter Input : evidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her second piece
Enter Input : of evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare
Enter Input : not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch on it
Enter Input : either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and
Enter Input : high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady
Enter Input : unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in
Enter Input : court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive of
Enter Input : ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given not
Enter Input : impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that a revengeful
Enter Input : woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in
Enter Input : particular, the insult and humiliation of her offering him the money. No,
Enter Input : it was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially
Enter Input : for a man so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he expected to
Enter Input : receive shortly from his father the three thousand roubles that he
Enter Input : reckoned was owing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just his
Enter Input : irresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that his
Enter Input : father would give him the money, that he would get it, and so could always
Enter Input : dispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set
Enter Input : aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That’s not his
Enter Input : character, he tells us, he couldn’t have had such feelings. But yet he
Enter Input : talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two
Enter Input : extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such
Enter Input : a two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved
Enter Input : by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if
Enter Input : something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is
Enter Input : love—that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he
Enter Input : needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she
Enter Input : were to say to him, ‘I am yours, I won’t have Fyodor Pavlovitch,’ then he
Enter Input : must have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing.
Enter Input : Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was
Enter Input : suffering from—what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and
Enter Input : concealing it in case of emergency?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the
Enter Input : expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant
Enter Input : to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. ‘If Fyodor
Enter Input : Pavlovitch doesn’t give the money,’ he thought, ‘I shall be put in the
Enter Input : position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.’ And then the idea presented
Enter Input : itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the
Enter Input : fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, ‘I am a
Enter Input : scoundrel, but not a thief.’ So here we have already a twofold reason why
Enter Input : he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he
Enter Input : shouldn’t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why
Enter Input : should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of
Enter Input : honor, granted that it’s misplaced, granted it’s often mistaken, yet it
Enter Input : exists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments reach
Enter Input : a climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and
Enter Input : more: ‘If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go off
Enter Input : with Grushenka?’ If he behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the
Enter Input : taverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he was
Enter Input : wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions
Enter Input : became so acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his
Enter Input : younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles,
Enter Input : but without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating the
Enter Input : old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect of
Enter Input : getting it from any one; his father would not give it him after that
Enter Input : beating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper part
Enter Input : of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother that he
Enter Input : had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would remain a
Enter Input : scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means, that he
Enter Input : wouldn’t have the character, that he wouldn’t have the will-power to do
Enter Input : it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey
Enter Input : Karamazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously and
Enter Input : convincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe in
Enter Input : money hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wrote
Enter Input : that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proof
Enter Input : of the prisoner having committed robbery! ‘I shall beg from every one, and
Enter Input : if I don’t get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope
Enter Input : with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan has
Enter Input : gone.’ A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he.
Enter Input : ‘It has all been done as he wrote,’ cries the prosecutor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But in the first place, it’s the letter of a drunken man and written in
Enter Input : great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he has
Enter Input : heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope himself; and
Enter Input : thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he did it? Did the
Enter Input : prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he find the money,
Enter Input : did that money exist indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ran
Enter Input : off, if you remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out
Enter Input : where she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry
Enter Input : out a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act
Enter Input : of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous
Enter Input : fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered him he
Enter Input : seized the money, too. But did he murder him after all? The charge of
Enter Input : robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery,
Enter Input : if it’s impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; that’s an
Enter Input : axiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is
Enter Input : that proved? Isn’t that, too, a romance?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man’s life is at
Enter Input : stake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor himself
Enter Input : admit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and
Enter Input : conscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal
Enter Input : drunken letter which was produced in court to-day. ‘All was done as
Enter Input : written.’ But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely
Enter Input : to find out where she was. That’s a fact that can’t be disputed. Had she
Enter Input : been at home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at her
Enter Input : side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ran
Enter Input : unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did not
Enter Input : even remember his drunken letter. ‘He snatched up the pestle,’ they say,
Enter Input : and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that
Enter Input : pestle—why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it
Enter Input : up, and so on, and so on. A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this
Enter Input : point: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on
Enter Input : the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put
Enter Input : away in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner’s eye, and he
Enter Input : would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he would
Enter Input : certainly not have killed any one. How then can I look upon the pestle as
Enter Input : a proof of premeditation?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two days
Enter Input : before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was quiet and
Enter Input : only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could not
Enter Input : help quarreling, forsooth! But my answer to that is, that, if he was
Enter Input : planning such a murder in accordance with his letter, he certainly would
Enter Input : not have quarreled even with a shopman, and probably would not have gone
Enter Input : into the tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet
Enter Input : and retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard,
Enter Input : and that not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,
Enter Input : the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can use it.
Enter Input : As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month, don’t we often
Enter Input : hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns shout, ‘I’ll kill you’?
Enter Input : but they don’t murder any one. And that fatal letter—isn’t that simply
Enter Input : drunken irritability, too? Isn’t that simply the shout of the brawler
Enter Input : outside the tavern, ‘I’ll kill you! I’ll kill the lot of you!’ Why not,
Enter Input : why could it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter ‘fatal’
Enter Input : rather than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because a
Enter Input : witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his
Enter Input : hand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was
Enter Input : done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not ‘absurd,’ but
Enter Input : ‘fatal.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Now, thank God! we’ve come to the real point: ‘since he was in the
Enter Input : garden, he must have murdered him.’ In those few words: ‘since he _was_,
Enter Input : then he _must_’ lies the whole case for the prosecution. He was there, so
Enter Input : he must have. And what if there is no _must_ about it, even if he was
Enter Input : there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence—the coincidences—are really
Enter Input : suggestive. But examine all these facts separately, regardless of their
Enter Input : connection. Why, for instance, does the prosecution refuse to admit the
Enter Input : truth of the prisoner’s statement that he ran away from his father’s
Enter Input : window? Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the
Enter Input : expense of the respectful and ‘pious’ sentiments which suddenly came over
Enter Input : the murderer. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of
Enter Input : religious awe, if not of filial respect? ‘My mother must have been praying
Enter Input : for me at that moment,’ were the prisoner’s words at the preliminary
Enter Input : inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced himself that Madame
Enter Input : Svyetlov was not in his father’s house. ‘But he could not convince himself
Enter Input : by looking through the window,’ the prosecutor objects. But why couldn’t
Enter Input : he? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word
Enter Input : might have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which
Enter Input : showed the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume
Enter Input : everything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A
Enter Input : thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest
Enter Input : imagination.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly was in
Enter Input : the house, therefore he killed him.’ Now about that door, gentlemen of the
Enter Input : jury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that
Enter Input : door, and he was at the time in such a condition, that— But supposing the
Enter Input : door was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an
Enter Input : instinct of self-defense, natural in his position; supposing he did go
Enter Input : into the house—well, what then? How does it follow that because he was
Enter Input : there he committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the
Enter Input : rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him; but as
Enter Input : soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he may have run
Enter Input : away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed his
Enter Input : father. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptation
Enter Input : to kill his father, because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at
Enter Input : not having killed him, that he was capable of a pure feeling, the feeling
Enter Input : of pity and compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to the
Enter Input : assistance of Grigory after he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful
Enter Input : state of the prisoner’s mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him
Enter Input : calling him to new life, while love was impossible for him because he had
Enter Input : his father’s bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that
Enter Input : corpse—retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him love, which he
Enter Input : explained, according to his method, talking about his drunken condition,
Enter Input : about a criminal being taken to execution, about it being still far off,
Enter Input : and so on and so on. But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not
Enter Input : invented a new personality? Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to
Enter Input : be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape
Enter Input : punishment, if his hands were really stained with his father’s blood? No,
Enter Input : no, no! As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called
Enter Input : him to her side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must
Enter Input : have felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed
Enter Input : himself, if he had his father’s murder on his conscience. Oh, no! he would
Enter Input : not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the prisoner: the savage,
Enter Input : stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with
Enter Input : his character. He would have killed himself, that’s certain. He did not
Enter Input : kill himself just because ‘his mother’s prayers had saved him,’ and he was
Enter Input : innocent of his father’s blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that
Enter Input : night at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man
Enter Input : would recover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not
Enter Input : have to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?
Enter Input : What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But we shall be told at once again, ‘There is his father’s corpse! If he
Enter Input : ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?’ Here, I repeat, you
Enter Input : have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he?
Enter Input : There’s no one to put in his place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually true
Enter Input : that there is no one else at all? We’ve heard the prosecutor count on his
Enter Input : fingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were five
Enter Input : in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible—the
Enter Input : murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the
Enter Input : prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the
Enter Input : prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, that
Enter Input : had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would
Enter Input : have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have
Enter Input : accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the
Enter Input : very opposite conclusion? There are two persons—the prisoner and
Enter Input : Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because
Enter Input : you have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you
Enter Input : have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two
Enter Input : brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him: there
Enter Input : are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a
Enter Input : feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of
Enter Input : facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first place
Enter Input : we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the
Enter Input : genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to
Enter Input : make a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov’s sudden suicide on the eve of the
Enter Input : trial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the
Enter Input : elder of the prisoner’s brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has
Enter Input : to-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the
Enter Input : murderer. Oh, I fully share the court’s and the prosecutor’s conviction
Enter Input : that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement may
Enter Input : really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother by
Enter Input : throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again Smerdyakov’s name is
Enter Input : pronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery. There is something
Enter Input : unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we
Enter Input : won’t go into that now. Of that later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might
Enter Input : make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with
Enter Input : subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent I
Enter Input : cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him and
Enter Input : talked to him, and he made a very different impression on me. He was weak
Enter Input : in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the
Enter Input : weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of
Enter Input : the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity
Enter Input : about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme
Enter Input : mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _naïveté_, and an intelligence
Enter Input : of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for
Enter Input : weak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the
Enter Input : conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively
Enter Input : ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he
Enter Input : resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when
Enter Input : he remembered that he was the son of ‘stinking Lizaveta.’ He was
Enter Input : disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him
Enter Input : in his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to
Enter Input : France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn’t the
Enter Input : means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely
Enter Input : high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good
Enter Input : clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be
Enter Input : the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he
Enter Input : might well have resented his position, compared with that of his master’s
Enter Input : legitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights,
Enter Input : they had the inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himself
Enter Input : that he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The
Enter Input : destination of that sum—a sum which would have made his career—must have
Enter Input : been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in new
Enter Input : rainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.) Oh, beware of
Enter Input : showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once! And it
Enter Input : was the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man. The
Enter Input : sight of the rainbow-colored notes may have made a morbid impression on
Enter Input : his imagination, but with no immediate results.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us all
Enter Input : the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov’s guilt, and
Enter Input : asked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit. But he may
Enter Input : not have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite naturally,
Enter Input : but it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man may have
Enter Input : recovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as
Enter Input : happens with epileptics.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the
Enter Input : murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment. He might have waked
Enter Input : up from deep sleep (for he was only asleep—an epileptic fit is always
Enter Input : followed by a deep sleep) at that moment when the old Grigory shouted at
Enter Input : the top of his voice ‘Parricide!’ That shout in the dark and stillness may
Enter Input : have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment:
Enter Input : he might naturally have waked up an hour before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite
Enter Input : motive towards the sound to see what’s the matter. His head is still
Enter Input : clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in the
Enter Input : garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from
Enter Input : his master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind sets to
Enter Input : work at once. He hears all the details from his frightened master, and
Enter Input : gradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an idea—terrible,
Enter Input : but seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take the
Enter Input : three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A terrible
Enter Input : lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security
Enter Input : from detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often
Enter Input : when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers who
Enter Input : have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov may
Enter Input : have gone in and carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with any
Enter Input : stone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the
Enter Input : three thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting
Enter Input : myself—the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where
Enter Input : to find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money—the
Enter Input : torn envelope on the floor?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only
Enter Input : an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the
Enter Input : floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a piece
Enter Input : of evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearing
Enter Input : something very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that very
Enter Input : argument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved,
Enter Input : precisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself. What’s more, it struck
Enter Input : me at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about
Enter Input : him; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
Enter Input : it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same
Enter Input : idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall be asked, ‘What about the old woman, Grigory’s wife? She heard
Enter Input : the sick man moaning close by, all night.’ Yes, she heard it, but that
Enter Input : evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly
Enter Input : that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the poor
Enter Input : beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And that’s
Enter Input : natural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at
Enter Input : being waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a
Enter Input : groan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two
Enter Input : hours later—three times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeper
Enter Input : wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and
Enter Input : keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of two
Enter Input : hours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments of
Enter Input : waking, so he feels he has been waked up all night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his last
Enter Input : letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both?
Enter Input : But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not have
Enter Input : felt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are two very
Enter Input : different things. Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable, and the
Enter Input : suicide, laying his hands on himself, may well have felt redoubled hatred
Enter Input : for those whom he had envied all his life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is there
Enter Input : unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the error in my
Enter Input : reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And if there is but a
Enter Input : shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my propositions, do
Enter Input : not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I swear by all that is sacred,
Enter Input : I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward.
Enter Input : What troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts
Enter Input : heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a single
Enter Input : one certain and irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by
Enter Input : the accumulation of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the
Enter Input : blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt, the
Enter Input : dark night resounding with the shout ‘Parricide!’ and the old man falling
Enter Input : with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures,
Enter Input : shouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but,
Enter Input : gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds? Remember, you have been
Enter Input : given absolute power to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the
Enter Input : more terrible its responsibility.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but suppose
Enter Input : for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had
Enter Input : stained his hands with his father’s blood. This is only hypothesis, I
Enter Input : repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence. But, so be it, I
Enter Input : assume that my client is guilty of parricide. Even so, hear what I have to
Enter Input : say. I have it in my heart to say something more to you, for I feel that
Enter Input : there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my
Enter Input : referring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to
Enter Input : be truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. The last
Enter Input : words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that every
Enter Input : one felt that he really might have something to say, and that what he was
Enter Input : about to say would be of the greatest consequence. But the President,
Enter Input : hearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if
Enter Input : such an incident were repeated. Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch
Enter Input : began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used
Enter Input : hitherto.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with
Enter Input : ruin, gentlemen of the jury,” he began, “what is really damning for my
Enter Input : client is one fact—the dead body of his father. Had it been an ordinary
Enter Input : case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the
Enter Input : triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of the
Enter Input : evidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, you
Enter Input : would have hesitated to ruin a man’s life simply from the prejudice
Enter Input : against him which he has, alas! only too well deserved. But it’s not an
Enter Input : ordinary case of murder, it’s a case of parricide. That impresses men’s
Enter Input : minds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of
Enter Input : the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an
Enter Input : unprejudiced mind. How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he
Enter Input : committed the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one,
Enter Input : almost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, it’s a fearful thing to shed a father’s blood—the father who has
Enter Input : begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over my
Enter Input : illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness, and
Enter Input : has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a father—that’s
Enter Input : inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father—a real father? What
Enter Input : is the meaning of that great word? What is the great idea in that name? We
Enter Input : have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be.
Enter Input : In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our
Enter Input : hearts are aching—in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Enter Input : Karamazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we
Enter Input : have just referred. That’s the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are a
Enter Input : misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we must
Enter Input : shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the importance of
Enter Input : the decision you have to make. It’s our particular duty not to shrink from
Enter Input : any idea, like children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutor
Enter Input : happily expresses it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent (and he was
Enter Input : my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several times, ‘Oh, I will
Enter Input : not yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from
Enter Input : Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend also!’ He exclaimed that several times,
Enter Input : but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three
Enter Input : years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who
Enter Input : had been kind to him, as a child in his father’s house, might not such a
Enter Input : man well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his father’s
Enter Input : back-yard, ‘without boots on his feet and with his little trousers hanging
Enter Input : by one button’—to use the expression of the kind-hearted doctor,
Enter Input : Herzenstube?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at this
Enter Input : misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my client meet
Enter Input : with when he arrived here, at his father’s house, and why depict my client
Enter Input : as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he is wild and
Enter Input : unruly—we are trying him now for that—but who is responsible for his life?
Enter Input : Who is responsible for his having received such an unseemly bringing up,
Enter Input : in spite of his excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitive
Enter Input : heart? Did any one train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by
Enter Input : study? Did any one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was
Enter Input : left to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted
Enter Input : perhaps to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand times
Enter Input : perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away the loathsome
Enter Input : phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he may
Enter Input : have longed to embrace and to forgive his father! And what awaited him? He
Enter Input : was met by cynical taunts, suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard
Enter Input : nothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the
Enter Input : brandy, and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with
Enter Input : his own money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
Enter Input : And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of
Enter Input : his son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated him, bought
Enter Input : up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly, and
Enter Input : uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed,
Enter Input : exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don’t express it. Don’t laugh, don’t
Enter Input : laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at
Enter Input : my client for loving Schiller—loving the sublime and beautiful! I should
Enter Input : not have laughed at that in his place. Yes, such natures—oh, let me speak
Enter Input : in defense of such natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood—these
Enter Input : natures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in
Enter Input : contrast to themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity—they thirst for
Enter Input : it unconsciously. Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully
Enter Input : capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated
Enter Input : love. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in such
Enter Input : natures. But they cannot hide their passions—sometimes very coarse—and
Enter Input : that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Their
Enter Input : passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and lofty
Enter Input : creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks to
Enter Input : correct himself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, ‘sublime and
Enter Input : beautiful,’ however much the expression has been ridiculed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client’s
Enter Input : engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just now was not
Enter Input : evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and it
Enter Input : was not for her—oh, not for her!—to reproach him with treachery, for she
Enter Input : has betrayed him! If she had had but a little time for reflection she
Enter Input : would not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client
Enter Input : is not a monster, as she called him!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: ‘I am the Good
Enter Input : Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, so that not
Enter Input : one of them might be lost.’ Let not a man’s soul be lost through us!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I asked just now what does ‘father’ mean, and exclaimed that it was a
Enter Input : great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly, gentlemen,
Enter Input : and I venture to call things by their right names: such a father as old
Enter Input : Karamazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve to be. Filial
Enter Input : love for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an impossibility. Love cannot
Enter Input : be created from nothing: only God can create something from nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “ ‘Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,’ the apostle writes, from
Enter Input : a heart glowing with love. It’s not for the sake of my client that I quote
Enter Input : these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has authorized me
Enter Input : to preach to fathers? No one. But as a man and a citizen I make my
Enter Input : appeal—_vivos voco!_ We are not long on earth, we do many evil deeds and
Enter Input : say many evil words. So let us all catch a favorable moment when we are
Enter Input : all together to say a good word to each other. That’s what I am doing:
Enter Input : while I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for
Enter Input : nothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority—all Russia hears
Enter Input : us! I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud to
Enter Input : all fathers: ‘Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.’ Yes, let us
Enter Input : first fulfill Christ’s injunction ourselves and only then venture to
Enter Input : expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of
Enter Input : our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have
Enter Input : made them our enemies ourselves. ‘What measure ye mete it shall be
Enter Input : measured unto you again’—it’s not I who say that, it’s the Gospel precept,
Enter Input : measure to others according as they measure to you. How can we blame
Enter Input : children if they measure us according to our measure?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretly
Enter Input : given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no one knew
Enter Input : anything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks. It was
Enter Input : opened and inside was found the body of a new-born child which she had
Enter Input : killed. In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies
Enter Input : which, according to her own confession, she had killed at the moment of
Enter Input : their birth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave birth
Enter Input : to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would any one venture to
Enter Input : give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be bold, gentlemen, let us be
Enter Input : audacious even: it’s our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid
Enter Input : of certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovsky’s play, who
Enter Input : are scared at the sound of certain words. No, let us prove that the
Enter Input : progress of the last few years has touched even us, and let us say
Enter Input : plainly, the father is not merely he who begets the child, but he who
Enter Input : begets it and does his duty by it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other
Enter Input : interpretation of the word ‘father,’ which insists that any father, even
Enter Input : though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children, still
Enter Input : remains my father simply because he begot me. But this is, so to say, the
Enter Input : mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my intellect, but can only
Enter Input : accept by faith, or, better to say, _on faith_, like many other things
Enter Input : which I do not understand, but which religion bids me believe. But in that
Enter Input : case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of
Enter Input : actual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us
Enter Input : great duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be
Enter Input : humane—Christian, in fact—we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions
Enter Input : justified by reason and experience, which have been passed through the
Enter Input : crucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though
Enter Input : in dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill-treat
Enter Input : and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, but
Enter Input : rational and philanthropic....”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court,
Enter Input : but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him
Enter Input : finish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at once. The
Enter Input : orator went on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin to
Enter Input : reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not impose
Enter Input : on them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy father
Enter Input : involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature,
Enter Input : especially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his
Enter Input : companions. The conventional answer to this question is: ‘He begot you,
Enter Input : and you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.’
Enter Input : The youth involuntarily reflects: ‘But did he love me when he begot me?’
Enter Input : he asks, wondering more and more. ‘Was it for my sake he begot me? He did
Enter Input : not know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,
Enter Input : perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensity
Enter Input : to drunkenness—that’s all he’s done for me.... Why am I bound to love him
Enter Input : simply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my life
Enter Input : after?’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do not
Enter Input : expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. ‘Drive nature out of the
Enter Input : door and it will fly in at the window,’ and, above all, let us not be
Enter Input : afraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates of
Enter Input : reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas. How shall it be decided? Why,
Enter Input : like this. Let the son stand before his father and ask him, ‘Father, tell
Enter Input : me, why must I love you? Father, show me that I must love you,’ and if
Enter Input : that father is able to answer him and show him good reason, we have a
Enter Input : real, normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on
Enter Input : a rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does
Enter Input : not, there’s an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him, and the
Enter Input : son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even an enemy. Our
Enter Input : tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a school of true and sound
Enter Input : ideas.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic
Enter Input : applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of it
Enter Input : applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded. Shrieks and
Enter Input : exclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were sitting.
Enter Input : Handkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his bell with all
Enter Input : his might. He was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience, but
Enter Input : did not venture to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of
Enter Input : high position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially
Enter Input : reserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their
Enter Input : handkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down, the President confined
Enter Input : himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much has
Enter Input : been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to face
Enter Input : with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist most
Enter Input : emphatically it was not for money he ran to his father’s house: the charge
Enter Input : of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not to murder
Enter Input : him he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that design he would,
Enter Input : at least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The
Enter Input : brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it.
Enter Input : Granted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that
Enter Input : he made his way in—I’ve said already that I do not for a moment believe
Enter Input : that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment. Gentlemen,
Enter Input : I swear to you by all that’s holy, if it had not been his father, but an
Enter Input : ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfying
Enter Input : himself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, without
Enter Input : doing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him away
Enter Input : perhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare for
Enter Input : that. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, his
Enter Input : father! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood,
Enter Input : had been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was
Enter Input : enough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly,
Enter Input : clouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of
Enter Input : madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and
Enter Input : unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its
Enter Input : eternal laws.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But the prisoner even then did not murder him—I maintain that, I cry that
Enter Input : aloud!—no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust,
Enter Input : not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he not
Enter Input : had this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his father
Enter Input : down perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did not
Enter Input : know whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder.
Enter Input : Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot
Enter Input : be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by
Enter Input : prejudice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this
Enter Input : murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and
Enter Input : punish him, he will say to himself: ‘These people have done nothing for my
Enter Input : bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make
Enter Input : me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat
Enter Input : and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they
Enter Input : have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and
Enter Input : owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They
Enter Input : are cruel and I will be cruel.’ That is what he will say, gentlemen of the
Enter Input : jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for
Enter Input : him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and
Enter Input : will not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him the
Enter Input : possibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickedness
Enter Input : and blindness all his life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful
Enter Input : punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and
Enter Input : regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see,
Enter Input : you will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck. ‘How can I endure
Enter Input : this mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?’ That’s what
Enter Input : he will exclaim.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen of
Enter Input : the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and loving
Enter Input : action, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in their
Enter Input : limitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with mercy, show
Enter Input : it love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses in
Enter Input : it. Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are
Enter Input : good and just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse
Enter Input : and the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say
Enter Input : then, ‘I am quits,’ but will say, ‘I am guilty in the sight of all men and
Enter Input : am more unworthy than all.’ With tears of penitence and poignant, tender
Enter Input : anguish, he will exclaim: ‘Others are better than I, they wanted to save
Enter Input : me, not to ruin me!’ Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the
Enter Input : absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to
Enter Input : pronounce: ‘Yes, he is guilty.’
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear,
Enter Input : do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious
Enter Input : history? It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that
Enter Input : the Russian court does not exist for the punishment only, but also for the
Enter Input : salvation of the criminal! Let other nations think of retribution and the
Enter Input : letter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaning—the
Enter Input : salvation and the reformation of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and
Enter Input : her justice are such, she may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to
Enter Input : scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside
Enter Input : in disgust. Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will
Enter Input : move calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my
Enter Input : client, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend it,
Enter Input : you will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch over it, that
Enter Input : it is in good hands!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter XIV. The Peasants Stand Firm
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of the
Enter Input : audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the question to
Enter Input : stop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important
Enter Input : personages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringing
Enter Input : his bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression
Enter Input : of something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself
Enter Input : was genuinely touched.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain
Enter Input : objections. People looked at him with hatred. “What? What’s the meaning of
Enter Input : it? He positively dares to make objections,” the ladies babbled. But if
Enter Input : the whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could not
Enter Input : have been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking with
Enter Input : emotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,
Enter Input : could hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered
Enter Input : himself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defense
Enter Input : if not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.
Enter Input : Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelope
Enter Input : and throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged in
Enter Input : this strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we
Enter Input : that he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded
Enter Input : idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for
Enter Input : his illegitimate birth—isn’t this a romance in the Byronic style? And the
Enter Input : son who breaks into his father’s house and murders him without murdering
Enter Input : him is not even a romance—this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he
Enter Input : cannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and what’s the
Enter Input : meaning of his murdering him without having murdered him—who can make head
Enter Input : or tail of this?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound
Enter Input : ideas and from this tribune of ‘sound ideas’ is heard a solemn declaration
Enter Input : that to call the murder of a father ‘parricide’ is nothing but a
Enter Input : prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask
Enter Input : his father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will become
Enter Input : of the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,
Enter Input : it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants’ wives. The most precious,
Enter Input : the most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice
Enter Input : are presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an
Enter Input : object—to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.
Enter Input : ‘Oh, crush him by mercy,’ cries the counsel for the defense; but that’s
Enter Input : all the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is
Enter Input : crushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only
Enter Input : for the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of
Enter Input : the parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?
Enter Input : Religion and the Gospel are corrected—that’s all mysticism, we are told,
Enter Input : and ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the
Enter Input : analysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false
Enter Input : semblance of Christ! ‘What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you
Enter Input : again,’ cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that
Enter Input : Christ teaches us to measure as it is measured to us—and this from the
Enter Input : tribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve
Enter Input : of making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance
Enter Input : with what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use
Enter Input : to produce a certain effect—all to serve the purpose! But what Christ
Enter Input : commands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,
Enter Input : because the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn
Enter Input : the other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to
Enter Input : us. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to
Enter Input : murder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of
Enter Input : truth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for
Enter Input : the defense deigns to call only ‘the crucified lover of humanity,’ in
Enter Input : opposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, ‘For Thou art our
Enter Input : God!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,
Enter Input : begging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as
Enter Input : presidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. The
Enter Input : public was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.
Enter Input : Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to lay
Enter Input : his hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full
Enter Input : of dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on “romancing”
Enter Input : and “psychology,” and in an appropriate place quoted, “Jupiter, you are
Enter Input : angry, therefore you are wrong,” which provoked a burst of approving
Enter Input : laughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like
Enter Input : Jupiter. Then, _à propos_ of the accusation that he was teaching the young
Enter Input : generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with great
Enter Input : dignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor’s charge of
Enter Input : uttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal
Enter Input : insinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from
Enter Input : accusations “damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.”
Enter Input : But at these words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch
Enter Input : concluded his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.
Enter Input : And Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, “crushed for
Enter Input : good.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said very
Enter Input : little. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look of
Enter Input : strength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had
Enter Input : almost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through an
Enter Input : experience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life
Enter Input : something very important he had not understood till then. His voice was
Enter Input : weak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of
Enter Input : humility, defeat and submission.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come
Enter Input : for me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring man!
Enter Input : But, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father’s blood! For
Enter Input : the last time I repeat, it wasn’t I killed him! I was erring, but I loved
Enter Input : what is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild
Enter Input : beast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I
Enter Input : did not know; but it’s not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is
Enter Input : mistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but it’s not
Enter Input : true that I killed my father, and he needn’t have supposed it. And don’t
Enter Input : believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you
Enter Input : spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. I
Enter Input : give you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I’ll break
Enter Input : my sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob
Enter Input : me of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen
Enter Input : ... spare me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly
Enter Input : articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions
Enter Input : and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for
Enter Input : consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the
Enter Input : jury was rather feeble. “Be impartial, don’t be influenced by the
Enter Input : eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there
Enter Input : is a great responsibility laid upon you,” and so on and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move
Enter Input : about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the
Enter Input : buffet. It was very late, almost one o’clock in the night, but nobody went
Enter Input : away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All
Enter Input : waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for
Enter Input : the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts
Enter Input : were untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all
Enter Input : prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must
Enter Input : own there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an
Enter Input : acquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while some
Enter Input : were simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch
Enter Input : himself was confident of his success. He was surrounded by people
Enter Input : congratulating him and fawning upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There are,” he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, “there are
Enter Input : invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury. One
Enter Input : feels during one’s speech if they are being formed. I was aware of them.
Enter Input : They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What will our peasants say now?” said one stout, cross-looking,
Enter Input : pock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a
Enter Input : group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks among
Enter Input : them.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, there are clerks,” said a member of the district council, joining
Enter Input : the group.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What of him?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is a man with brains.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But he never speaks.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He is no great talker, but so much the better. There’s no need for the
Enter Input : Petersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself. He’s
Enter Input : the father of twelve children. Think of that!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Upon my word, you don’t suppose they won’t acquit him?” one of our young
Enter Input : officials exclaimed in another group.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They’ll acquit him for certain,” said a resolute voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!” cried the
Enter Input : official. “Suppose he did murder him—there are fathers and fathers! And,
Enter Input : besides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done nothing but
Enter Input : swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down. But it was a
Enter Input : pity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! If I’d
Enter Input : been in Fetyukovitch’s place, I should simply have said straight out: ‘He
Enter Input : murdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it all!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what he did, only without saying, ‘Hang it all!’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,” put in a third voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut
Enter Input : the throat of her lover’s lawful wife.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That makes no difference. She began cutting it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasn’t it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Splendid!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And about mysticism, too!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, drop mysticism, do!” cried some one else; “think of Ippolit and his
Enter Input : fate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow for
Enter Input : Mitya’s sake.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is she here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What an idea! If she’d been here she’d have scratched them out in court.
Enter Input : She is at home with toothache. He he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He he he!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a third group:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should not be surprised if he turns the ‘Metropolis’ upside down
Enter Input : to-morrow. He will be drinking for ten days!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, the devil!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The devil’s bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not here?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it’s not the thing to
Enter Input : break your father’s head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his
Enter Input : purpose.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had in
Enter Input : Russia?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither more
Enter Input : nor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public
Enter Input : had taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.
Enter Input : At last! I won’t repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I have
Enter Input : forgotten them. I remember only the answer to the President’s first and
Enter Input : chief question: “Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of
Enter Input : robbery and with premeditation?” (I don’t remember the exact words.) There
Enter Input : was a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,
Enter Input : pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of the
Enter Input : court:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, guilty!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And the same answer was repeated to every question: “Yes, guilty!” and
Enter Input : without the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;
Enter Input : almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.
Enter Input : The deathlike silence in the court was not broken—all seemed petrified:
Enter Input : those who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager for
Enter Input : his acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was
Enter Input : followed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were
Enter Input : pleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their
Enter Input : joy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their
Enter Input : shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But how
Enter Input : shall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they would create
Enter Input : a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly the
Enter Input : whole court rang with exclamations: “What’s the meaning of it? What next?”
Enter Input : They leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at
Enter Input : once reconsidered and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up
Enter Input : and cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before him:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of my
Enter Input : father’s blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on the
Enter Input : other woman!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard
Enter Input : all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own. From the
Enter Input : farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek—it was
Enter Input : Grushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again
Enter Input : before the beginning of the lawyers’ speeches. Mitya was taken away. The
Enter Input : passing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was in
Enter Input : a hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I
Enter Input : heard on the steps as I went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He’ll have a twenty years’ trip to the mines!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Not less.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, our peasants have stood firm.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And have done for our Mitya.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : EPILOGUE
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter I. Plans For Mitya’s Escape
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Very early, at nine o’clock in the morning, five days after the trial,
Enter Input : Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna’s to talk over a matter of great
Enter Input : importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked
Enter Input : to him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the
Enter Input : next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and
Enter Input : unconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable
Enter Input : gossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who
Enter Input : lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in
Enter Input : court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the
Enter Input : sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were
Enter Input : attending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give
Enter Input : an opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors
Enter Input : encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could
Enter Input : not yet give them positive hopes of recovery.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time he had
Enter Input : specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to
Enter Input : approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement
Enter Input : that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of
Enter Input : haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale
Enter Input : and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical
Enter Input : excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to
Enter Input : her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t worry about his decision,” she said, with confident emphasis to
Enter Input : Alyosha. “One way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape.
Enter Input : That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle—not he, not Dmitri
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has
Enter Input : sacrificed himself for his brother,” Katya added, with flashing eyes—“told
Enter Input : me the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into
Enter Input : negotiations.... I’ve told you something already.... You see, it will
Enter Input : probably come off at the third _étape_ from here, when the party of
Enter Input : prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it’s a long way off yet. Ivan
Enter Input : Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _étape_.
Enter Input : But we don’t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it’s
Enter Input : impossible to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I will
Enter Input : show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the
Enter Input : eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when—do you remember?—you
Enter Input : found us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs, but seeing you I made
Enter Input : him come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling about
Enter Input : then?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, I don’t,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had
Enter Input : told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it
Enter Input : at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told
Enter Input : me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with
Enter Input : that creature, I felt furious at once—I can’t tell you why, I don’t know
Enter Input : myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and
Enter Input : that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed
Enter Input : suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. “As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw
Enter Input : that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous
Enter Input : of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel
Enter Input : began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I
Enter Input : could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving
Enter Input : that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love
Enter Input : Dmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that
Enter Input : creature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you
Enter Input : came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if
Enter Input : anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the
Enter Input : envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or was
Enter Input : taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then he left me money,
Enter Input : nearly ten thousand—those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his
Enter Input : speech, having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be changed. I
Enter Input : was tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up
Enter Input : his idea of saving his brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to
Enter Input : me, though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved
Enter Input : Mitya. Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness
Enter Input : of such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his feet
Enter Input : in reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only for my joy
Enter Input : at the thought of Mitya’s being saved (and he certainly would have
Enter Input : imagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere possibility of such
Enter Input : an unjust thought on his part that I lost my temper again, and instead of
Enter Input : kissing his feet, flew into a fury again! Oh, I am unhappy! It’s my
Enter Input : character, my awful, unhappy character! Oh, you will see, I shall end by
Enter Input : driving him, too, to abandon me for another with whom he can get on
Enter Input : better, like Dmitri. But ... no, I could not bear it, I should kill
Enter Input : myself. And when you came in then, and when I called to you and told him
Enter Input : to come back, I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he
Enter Input : turned on me that—do you remember?—I cried out to you that it was he, he
Enter Input : alone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I said
Enter Input : that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again. He had never, never
Enter Input : persuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I
Enter Input : who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved
Enter Input : the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he
Enter Input : was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not
Enter Input : ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the
Enter Input : cause of it all, I alone am to blame!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that
Enter Input : she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest
Enter Input : heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh,
Enter Input : Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had
Enter Input : carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it
Enter Input : would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought
Enter Input : so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her
Enter Input : “treachery” at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was
Enter Input : impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries
Enter Input : and hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and
Enter Input : longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more
Enter Input : difficult. He spoke of Mitya again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all right, it’s all right, don’t be anxious about him!” she began
Enter Input : again, sharply and stubbornly. “All that is only momentary, I know him, I
Enter Input : know his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to escape.
Enter Input : It’s not as though it would be immediately; he will have time to make up
Enter Input : his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and will
Enter Input : manage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it. Don’t
Enter Input : be anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed already: do you
Enter Input : suppose he would give up that creature? And they won’t let her go to him,
Enter Input : so he is bound to escape. It’s you he’s most afraid of, he is afraid you
Enter Input : won’t approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously
Enter Input : _allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,” Katya added viciously. She
Enter Input : paused and smiled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “He talks about some hymn,” she went on again, “some cross he has to bear,
Enter Input : some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal about it, and
Enter Input : if you knew how he talked!” Katya cried suddenly, with feeling she could
Enter Input : not repress, “if you knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment he
Enter Input : told me, and how he hated him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heard
Enter Input : his story and his tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I
Enter Input : am responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable of
Enter Input : suffering,” Katya concluded irritably. “Can such a man suffer? Men like
Enter Input : him never suffer!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words. And
Enter Input : yet it was she who had betrayed him. “Perhaps because she feels how she’s
Enter Input : wronged him she hates him at moments,” Alyosha thought to himself. He
Enter Input : hoped that it was only “at moments.” In Katya’s last words he detected a
Enter Input : challenging note, but he did not take it up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself.
Enter Input : Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable, cowardly,
Enter Input : or something ... unchristian, perhaps?” Katya added, even more defiantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, no. I’ll tell him everything,” muttered Alyosha. “He asks you to come
Enter Input : and see him to-day,” he blurted out suddenly, looking her steadily in the
Enter Input : face. She started, and drew back a little from him on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Me? Can that be?” she faltered, turning pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It can and ought to be!” Alyosha began emphatically, growing more
Enter Input : animated. “He needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened the
Enter Input : subject and worried you, if it were not necessary. He is ill, he is beside
Enter Input : himself, he keeps asking for you. It is not to be reconciled with you that
Enter Input : he wants you, but only that you would go and show yourself at his door. So
Enter Input : much has happened to him since that day. He realizes that he has injured
Enter Input : you beyond all reckoning. He does not ask your forgiveness—‘It’s
Enter Input : impossible to forgive me,’ he says himself—but only that you would show
Enter Input : yourself in his doorway.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s so sudden....” faltered Katya. “I’ve had a presentiment all these
Enter Input : days that you would come with that message. I knew he would ask me to
Enter Input : come. It’s impossible!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the first
Enter Input : time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never
Enter Input : grasped it before so fully. He said, ‘If she refuses to come I shall be
Enter Input : unhappy all my life.’ Do you hear? though he is condemned to penal
Enter Input : servitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy—is not that
Enter Input : piteous? Think—you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,”
Enter Input : broke like a challenge from Alyosha. “His hands are clean, there is no
Enter Input : blood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit
Enter Input : him now. Go, greet him on his way into the darkness—stand at his door,
Enter Input : that is all.... You ought to do it, you ought to!” Alyosha concluded,
Enter Input : laying immense stress on the word “ought.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I ought to ... but I cannot....” Katya moaned. “He will look at me.... I
Enter Input : can’t.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you don’t
Enter Input : make up your mind to do it now?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Better suffer all my life.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You ought to go, you ought to go,” Alyosha repeated with merciless
Enter Input : emphasis.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But why to-day, why at once?... I can’t leave our patient—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don’t come, he
Enter Input : will be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity on
Enter Input : him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have pity on _me!_” Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst into
Enter Input : tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Then you will come,” said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. “I’ll go and
Enter Input : tell him you will come directly.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, don’t tell him so on any account,” cried Katya in alarm. “I will
Enter Input : come, but don’t tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not go
Enter Input : in.... I don’t know yet—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And what if I meet any one?” she said suddenly, in a low voice, turning
Enter Input : white again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one. There will be
Enter Input : no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,” he
Enter Input : concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Chapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes Truth
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day after his
Enter Input : fate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was sent
Enter Input : to the prison division of the town hospital. But at the request of several
Enter Input : persons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had put
Enter Input : Mitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one
Enter Input : where Smerdyakov had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at the
Enter Input : other end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so
Enter Input : that Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown, which
Enter Input : was not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and compassionate
Enter Input : young man. He knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass at
Enter Input : once so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers, and that he
Enter Input : must get used to it by degrees. The visits of relations and friends were
Enter Input : informally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer, and even by the police
Enter Input : captain. But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had
Enter Input : tried to force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky
Enter Input : not to admit him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing-gown, rather
Enter Input : feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his head. He
Enter Input : looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression, but there
Enter Input : was a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had become
Enter Input : terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be silent for
Enter Input : half an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily and
Enter Input : painfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused himself from
Enter Input : his brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness
Enter Input : and never of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face
Enter Input : of suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka
Enter Input : than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but as
Enter Input : soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was
Enter Input : waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a question.
Enter Input : He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at the
Enter Input : same time he felt that if she did not come, something inconceivable would
Enter Input : happen. Alyosha understood his feelings.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Trifon Borissovitch,” Mitya began nervously, “has pulled his whole inn to
Enter Input : pieces, I am told. He’s taken up the flooring, pulled apart the planks,
Enter Input : split up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking treasure all the
Enter Input : time—the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said I’d hidden
Enter Input : there. He began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he got home.
Enter Input : Serve him right, the swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he comes
Enter Input : from there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen,” began Alyosha. “She will come, but I don’t know when. Perhaps
Enter Input : to-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can’t tell. But she will come, she
Enter Input : will, that’s certain.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The news had a
Enter Input : tremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would have liked terribly
Enter Input : to know what had been said, but he was again afraid to ask. Something
Enter Input : cruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him like a knife at that
Enter Input : moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “This was what she said among other things; that I must be sure to set
Enter Input : your conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well by then she
Enter Input : will see to it all herself.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ve spoken of that already,” Mitya observed musingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you have repeated it to Grusha,” observed Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” Mitya admitted. “She won’t come this morning.” He looked timidly at
Enter Input : his brother. “She won’t come till the evening. When I told her yesterday
Enter Input : that Katya was taking measures, she was silent, but she set her mouth. She
Enter Input : only whispered, ‘Let her!’ She understood that it was important. I did not
Enter Input : dare to try her further. She understands now, I think, that Katya no
Enter Input : longer cares for me, but loves Ivan.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Does she?” broke from Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,” Mitya
Enter Input : hastened to explain again; “I asked her to do something for me. You know,
Enter Input : Ivan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not us. He will recover.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she scarcely
Enter Input : doubts of his recovery,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That means that she is convinced he will die. It’s because she is
Enter Input : frightened she’s so sure he will get well.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there’s every hope
Enter Input : that he will get well,” Alyosha observed anxiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die. She has a
Enter Input : great deal of sorrow to bear...” A silence followed. A grave anxiety was
Enter Input : fretting Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,” he said suddenly in a shaking voice,
Enter Input : full of tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They won’t let her go out there to you,” Alyosha put in at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And there is something else I wanted to tell you,” Mitya went on, with a
Enter Input : sudden ring in his voice. “If they beat me on the way or out there, I
Enter Input : won’t submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it. And
Enter Input : this will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as it is.
Enter Input : I’ve been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself. I am not
Enter Input : ready! I am not able to resign myself. I wanted to sing a ‘hymn’; but if a
Enter Input : guard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it. For Grusha
Enter Input : I would bear anything ... anything except blows.... But she won’t be
Enter Input : allowed to come there.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha smiled gently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Listen, brother, once for all,” he said. “This is what I think about it.
Enter Input : And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not ready,
Enter Input : and such a cross is not for you. What’s more, you don’t need such a
Enter Input : martyr’s cross when you are not ready for it. If you had murdered our
Enter Input : father, it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment. But you
Enter Input : are innocent, and such a cross is too much for you. You wanted to make
Enter Input : yourself another man by suffering. I say, only remember that other man
Enter Input : always, all your life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for
Enter Input : you. Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all
Enter Input : your life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more to
Enter Input : make you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For there you would
Enter Input : not endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would say: ‘I am
Enter Input : quits.’ The lawyer was right about that. Such heavy burdens are not for
Enter Input : all men. For some they are impossible. These are my thoughts about it, if
Enter Input : you want them so much. If other men would have to answer for your escape,
Enter Input : officers or soldiers, then I would not have ‘allowed’ you,” smiled
Enter Input : Alyosha. “But they declare—the superintendent of that _étape_ told Ivan
Enter Input : himself—that if it’s well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that
Enter Input : they can get off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a
Enter Input : case, but I can’t undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya
Enter Input : commissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes. I must
Enter Input : tell you the truth. And so I can’t judge of your own action. But let me
Enter Input : assure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would be a strange thing
Enter Input : if I could judge you in this. Now I think I’ve gone into everything.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But I do condemn myself!” cried Mitya. “I shall escape, that was settled
Enter Input : apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away? But I
Enter Input : shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That’s how the
Enter Input : Jesuits talk, isn’t it? Just as we are doing?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes.” Alyosha smiled gently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything,”
Enter Input : cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. “So I’ve caught my Alyosha being
Enter Input : Jesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest; I’ll open
Enter Input : the other side of my heart to you. This is what I planned and decided. If
Enter Input : I run away, even with money and a passport, and even to America, I should
Enter Input : be cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, not
Enter Input : for happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is as
Enter Input : bad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already. Even though
Enter Input : Grusha will be with me. Just look at her; is she an American? She is
Enter Input : Russian, Russian to the marrow of her bones; she will be homesick for the
Enter Input : mother country, and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for my
Enter Input : sake, that she has taken up that cross for me. And what harm has she done?
Enter Input : And how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out there, though they may be
Enter Input : better than I, every one of them? I hate that America already! And though
Enter Input : they may be wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are
Enter Input : not of my soul. I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I
Enter Input : am a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there!” he exclaimed, his eyes
Enter Input : suddenly flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. “So this is what
Enter Input : I’ve decided, Alyosha, listen,” he began again, mastering his emotion. “As
Enter Input : soon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on the
Enter Input : land, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears. There must be
Enter Input : some remote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there,
Enter Input : somewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to the country of the _Last of
Enter Input : the Mohicans_, and there we’ll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I.
Enter Input : Work and grammar—that’s how we’ll spend three years. And by that time we
Enter Input : shall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we’ve learnt
Enter Input : it—good-by to America! We’ll run here to Russia as American citizens.
Enter Input : Don’t be uneasy—we would not come to this little town. We’d hide
Enter Input : somewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall be
Enter Input : changed by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors shall
Enter Input : make me some sort of wart on my face—what’s the use of their being so
Enter Input : mechanical!—or else I’ll put out one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and I
Enter Input : shall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say they won’t recognize us.
Enter Input : And if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I don’t care. It will show
Enter Input : it’s our fate. We’ll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds,
Enter Input : and I’ll make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our own
Enter Input : soil. That’s my plan, and it shan’t be altered. Do you approve?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes,” said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for a
Enter Input : minute and said suddenly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn’t they work it up!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,” said
Enter Input : Alyosha, with a sigh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it’s hard,” Mitya
Enter Input : moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!” he exclaimed suddenly. “Tell
Enter Input : me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she say
Enter Input : it?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “She said she would come, but I don’t know whether she will come to-day.
Enter Input : It’s hard for her, you know,” Alyosha looked timidly at his brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of my
Enter Input : mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my heart:
Enter Input : what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It’s the
Enter Input : headstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a
Enter Input : scoundrel, that’s all one can say.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Here she is!” cried Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood
Enter Input : still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt impulsively to
Enter Input : his feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale, but a
Enter Input : timid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with an
Enter Input : irresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it, she flew
Enter Input : impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and almost by force made
Enter Input : him sit down on the bed. She sat down beside him, and still keeping his
Enter Input : hands pressed them violently. Several times they both strove to speak, but
Enter Input : stopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes
Enter Input : fastened on one another. So passed two minutes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Have you forgiven me?” Mitya faltered at last, and at the same moment
Enter Input : turning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried, “Do you hear what
Enter Input : I am asking, do you hear?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!” broke from
Enter Input : Katya. “My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether you
Enter Input : forgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and I in
Enter Input : yours—so it must be....” She stopped to take breath. “What have I come
Enter Input : for?” she began again with nervous haste: “to embrace your feet, to press
Enter Input : your hands like this, till it hurts—you remember how in Moscow I used to
Enter Input : squeeze them—to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you
Enter Input : that I love you madly,” she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his
Enter Input : hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha stood
Enter Input : speechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was seeing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Love is over, Mitya!” Katya began again, “but the past is painfully dear
Enter Input : to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have been
Enter Input : come true for one minute,” she faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into
Enter Input : his face joyfully again. “You love another woman, and I love another man,
Enter Input : and yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that?
Enter Input : Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life!” she cried, with a quiver
Enter Input : almost of menace in her voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,” Mitya began, drawing a
Enter Input : deep breath at each word, “do you know, five days ago, that same evening,
Enter Input : I loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life!
Enter Input : So it will be, so it will always be—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhaps
Enter Input : not even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believed
Enter Input : what they said implicitly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Katya,” cried Mitya suddenly, “do you believe I murdered him? I know you
Enter Input : don’t believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence.... Surely,
Enter Input : surely you did not believe it!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I did not believe it even then. I’ve never believed it. I hated you, and
Enter Input : for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuaded
Enter Input : myself and believed it, but when I’d finished speaking I left off
Enter Input : believing it at once. Don’t doubt that! I have forgotten that I came here
Enter Input : to punish myself,” she said, with a new expression in her voice, quite
Enter Input : unlike the loving tones of a moment before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Woman, yours is a heavy burden,” broke, as it were, involuntarily from
Enter Input : Mitya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let me go,” she whispered. “I’ll come again. It’s more than I can bear
Enter Input : now.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and
Enter Input : staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room.
Enter Input : No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she
Enter Input : reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and
Enter Input : moaned softly, almost in a whisper:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Forgive me!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,
Enter Input : venomous voice, answered:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As
Enter Input : though we could forgive one another! Save him, and I’ll worship you all my
Enter Input : life.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You won’t forgive her!” cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Don’t be anxious, I’ll save him for you!” Katya whispered rapidly, and
Enter Input : she ran out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness
Enter Input : herself?” Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mitya, don’t dare to blame her; you have no right to!” Alyosha cried
Enter Input : hotly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,” Grushenka brought out in a tone of
Enter Input : disgust. “If she saves you I’ll forgive her everything—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yet
Enter Input : recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally,
Enter Input : with no suspicion of what she would meet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Alyosha, run after her!” Mitya cried to his brother; “tell her ... I
Enter Input : don’t know ... don’t let her go away like this!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I’ll come to you again at nightfall,” said Alyosha, and he ran after
Enter Input : Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast,
Enter Input : but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, before that woman I can’t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness
Enter Input : because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive
Enter Input : me.... I like her for that!” she added, in an unnatural voice, and her
Enter Input : eyes flashed with fierce resentment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “My brother did not expect this in the least,” muttered Alyosha. “He was
Enter Input : sure she would not come—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No doubt. Let us leave that,” she snapped. “Listen: I can’t go with you
Enter Input : to the funeral now. I’ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money.
Enter Input : If necessary, tell them I’ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave
Enter Input : me, please. You are late as it is—the bells are ringing for the
Enter Input : service.... Leave me, please!”

Enter Input : Chapter III. Ilusha’s Funeral. The Speech At The Stone
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to
Enter Input : bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him. It
Enter Input : was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was
Enter Input : sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the
Enter Input : boys, Ilusha’s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him
Enter Input : and were glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,
Enter Input : they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. “Father
Enter Input : will cry, be with father,” Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the
Enter Input : boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “How glad I am you’ve come, Karamazov!” he cried, holding out his hand to
Enter Input : Alyosha. “It’s awful here. It’s really horrible to see it. Snegiryov is
Enter Input : not drunk, we know for a fact he’s had nothing to drink to-day, but he
Enter Input : seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful.
Enter Input : Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What is it, Kolya?” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or was
Enter Input : it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven’t slept for the last four
Enter Input : nights for thinking of it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,” answered Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s what I said,” cried Smurov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “So he will perish an innocent victim!” exclaimed Kolya; “though he is
Enter Input : ruined he is happy! I could envy him!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you mean? How can you? Why?” cried Alyosha surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!” said Kolya
Enter Input : with enthusiasm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!” said
Enter Input : Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for disgrace,
Enter Input : I don’t care about that—our names may perish. I respect your brother!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And so do I!” the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had founded
Enter Input : Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his ears like
Enter Input : a peony as he had done on that occasion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and his eyes
Enter Input : closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His thin face was
Enter Input : hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of decay from
Enter Input : the corpse. The expression of his face was serious and, as it were,
Enter Input : thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his breast, looked particularly
Enter Input : beautiful, as though chiseled in marble. There were flowers in his hands
Enter Input : and the coffin, inside and out, was decked with flowers, which had been
Enter Input : sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too
Enter Input : from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had
Enter Input : a bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear
Enter Input : boy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not look
Enter Input : at any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, “mamma,” who kept trying to
Enter Input : stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had
Enter Input : been pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat with
Enter Input : her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly weeping.
Enter Input : Snegiryov’s face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There was
Enter Input : something crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him. “Old
Enter Input : man, dear old man!” he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was
Enter Input : his habit to call Ilusha “old man,” as a term of affection when he was
Enter Input : alive.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his hand and
Enter Input : give it me,” the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either because the
Enter Input : little white rose in Ilusha’s hand had caught her fancy or that she wanted
Enter Input : one from his hand to keep in memory of him, she moved restlessly,
Enter Input : stretching out her hands for the flower.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t give it to any one, I won’t give you anything,” Snegiryov cried
Enter Input : callously. “They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is his, nothing is
Enter Input : yours!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Father, give mother a flower!” said Nina, lifting her face wet with
Enter Input : tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I won’t give away anything and to her less than any one! She didn’t love
Enter Input : Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it to her,” the
Enter Input : captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given up his
Enter Input : cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in noiseless
Enter Input : tears, hiding her face in her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that it
Enter Input : was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began to
Enter Input : lift it up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I don’t want him to be buried in the churchyard,” Snegiryov wailed
Enter Input : suddenly; “I’ll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha told me to. I
Enter Input : won’t let him be carried out!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had been saying for the last three days that he would bury him by the
Enter Input : stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all the boys
Enter Input : interfered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had hanged
Enter Input : himself!” the old landlady said sternly. “There in the churchyard the
Enter Input : ground has been crossed. He’ll be prayed for there. One can hear the
Enter Input : singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it
Enter Input : will reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, “Take him
Enter Input : where you will.” The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed the
Enter Input : mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might say
Enter Input : good-by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little face, which for the
Enter Input : last three days she had only looked at from a distance, she trembled all
Enter Input : over and her gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your blessing, kiss
Enter Input : him,” Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched like an automaton and
Enter Input : with a face contorted with bitter grief she began, without a word, beating
Enter Input : her breast with her fist. They carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed
Enter Input : her lips to her brother’s for the last time as they bore the coffin by
Enter Input : her. As Alyosha went out of the house he begged the landlady to look after
Enter Input : those who were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had
Enter Input : finished.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “To be sure, I’ll stay with them, we are Christians, too.” The old woman
Enter Input : wept as she said it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than three
Enter Input : hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost. The church
Enter Input : bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the
Enter Input : coffin, in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare and his soft,
Enter Input : old, wide-brimmed hat in his hand. He seemed in a state of bewildered
Enter Input : anxiety. At one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head of
Enter Input : the coffin and only hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and
Enter Input : tried to find a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he
Enter Input : rushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the
Enter Input : loss of that flower.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And the crust of bread, we’ve forgotten the crust!” he cried suddenly in
Enter Input : dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust of
Enter Input : bread already and that it was in his pocket. He instantly pulled it out
Enter Input : and was reassured.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,” he explained at once to Alyosha. “I was
Enter Input : sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: ‘Father, when my grave
Enter Input : is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly
Enter Input : down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That’s a good thing,” said Alyosha, “we must often take some.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Every day, every day!” said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at the
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it.
Enter Input : The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all through
Enter Input : the service. It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons were
Enter Input : without settings; but such churches are the best for praying in. During
Enter Input : the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had
Enter Input : outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At
Enter Input : one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the
Enter Input : wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it
Enter Input : and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood
Enter Input : quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity.
Enter Input : After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing
Enter Input : beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not
Enter Input : explain what he meant. During the prayer, “Like the Cherubim,” he joined
Enter Input : in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he
Enter Input : pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The
Enter Input : distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and
Enter Input : impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly
Enter Input : to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at
Enter Input : first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking
Enter Input : leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as
Enter Input : though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and
Enter Input : persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in
Enter Input : persuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively
Enter Input : stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He
Enter Input : looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he
Enter Input : apparently forgot his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink into
Enter Input : brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to
Enter Input : the grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church,
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary rites the
Enter Input : grave-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his flowers in his hands
Enter Input : bent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coat
Enter Input : in alarm and pulled him back. He did not seem to understand fully what was
Enter Input : happening. When they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed
Enter Input : anxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no
Enter Input : one could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he was
Enter Input : reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited,
Enter Input : snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the
Enter Input : morsels on the grave.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!” he muttered anxiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the bread
Enter Input : with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to some
Enter Input : one to hold for a time. But he would not do this and seemed indeed
Enter Input : suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they wanted to take them from
Enter Input : him altogether. And after looking at the grave, and as it were, satisfying
Enter Input : himself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled, he
Enter Input : suddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and
Enter Input : made his way homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he
Enter Input : almost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind to
Enter Input : mamma,” he began exclaiming suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he flung the
Enter Input : hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating, “I won’t have
Enter Input : the hat, I won’t have the hat.” Smurov picked it up and carried it after
Enter Input : him. All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy who discovered about
Enter Input : Troy most of all. Though Smurov, with the captain’s hat in his hand, was
Enter Input : crying bitterly too, he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red
Enter Input : brick that lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of
Enter Input : sparrows that was flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying
Enter Input : as he ran. Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a
Enter Input : minute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the
Enter Input : church, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly overtook
Enter Input : him and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell helpless on the snow
Enter Input : as though he had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing,
Enter Input : he began crying out, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man!” Alyosha and Kolya
Enter Input : tried to make him get up, soothing and persuading him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,” muttered Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “You’ll spoil the flowers,” said Alyosha, “and mamma is expecting them,
Enter Input : she is sitting crying because you would not give her any before. Ilusha’s
Enter Input : little bed is still there—”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes, mamma!” Snegiryov suddenly recollected, “they’ll take away the
Enter Input : bed, they’ll take it away,” he added as though alarmed that they really
Enter Input : would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far off and
Enter Input : they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called
Enter Input : to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just before:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,” he
Enter Input : cried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen
Enter Input : and broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that instant he saw
Enter Input : in the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha’s little boots, which the
Enter Input : landlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old, patched,
Enter Input : rusty-looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them, fell
Enter Input : on his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his lips to it, began
Enter Input : kissing it greedily, crying, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man, where are
Enter Input : your little feet?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?” the lunatic
Enter Input : cried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran out
Enter Input : of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let them weep,” he said to Kolya, “it’s no use trying to comfort them
Enter Input : just now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “No, it’s no use, it’s awful,” Kolya assented. “Do you know, Karamazov,”
Enter Input : he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, “I feel dreadfully
Enter Input : sad, and if it were only possible to bring him back, I’d give anything in
Enter Input : the world to do it.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, so would I,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to-night?
Enter Input : He’ll be drunk, you know.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to
Enter Input : spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come together
Enter Input : we shall remind them of everything again,” Alyosha suggested.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “The landlady is laying the table for them now—there’ll be a funeral
Enter Input : dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it,
Enter Input : Karamazov?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Of course,” said Alyosha.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “It’s all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it,
Enter Input : it all seems so unnatural in our religion.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “They are going to have salmon, too,” the boy who had discovered about
Enter Input : Troy observed in a loud voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your
Enter Input : idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn’t
Enter Input : care to know whether you exist or not!” Kolya snapped out irritably. The
Enter Input : boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov
Enter Input : exclaimed:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “There’s Ilusha’s stone, under which they wanted to bury him.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the whole
Enter Input : picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha,
Enter Input : weeping and hugging his father, had cried, “Father, father, how he
Enter Input : insulted you,” rose at once before his imagination.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and earnest
Enter Input : expression he looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant faces of
Enter Input : Ilusha’s schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes
Enter Input : upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two brothers,
Enter Input : of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death’s door.
Enter Input : But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long time, so we shall
Enter Input : part. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha’s stone, that we will never
Enter Input : forget Ilusha and one another. And whatever happens to us later in life,
Enter Input : if we don’t meet for twenty years afterwards, let us always remember how
Enter Input : we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, by
Enter Input : the bridge? and afterwards we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine boy,
Enter Input : a kind-hearted, brave boy, he felt for his father’s honor and resented the
Enter Input : cruel insult to him and stood up for him. And so in the first place, we
Enter Input : will remember him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied with
Enter Input : most important things, if we attain to honor or fall into great
Enter Input : misfortune—still let us remember how good it was once here, when we were
Enter Input : all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for the
Enter Input : time we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we are. My little
Enter Input : doves—let me call you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blue
Enter Input : birds, at this minute as I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,
Enter Input : perhaps you won’t understand what I am saying to you, because I often
Enter Input : speak very unintelligibly, but you’ll remember it all the same and will
Enter Input : agree with my words some time. You must know that there is nothing higher
Enter Input : and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some
Enter Input : good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you
Enter Input : a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved
Enter Input : from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such
Enter Input : memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one
Enter Input : has only one good memory left in one’s heart, even that may sometime be
Enter Input : the means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may be
Enter Input : unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men’s tears and at those
Enter Input : people who say as Kolya did just now, ‘I want to suffer for all men,’ and
Enter Input : may even jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we may
Enter Input : become—which God forbid—yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how we
Enter Input : loved him in his last days, and how we have been talking like friends all
Enter Input : together, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us—if we do
Enter Input : become so—will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at
Enter Input : this moment! What’s more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from great
Enter Input : evil and he will reflect and say, ‘Yes, I was good and brave and honest
Enter Input : then!’ Let him laugh to himself, that’s no matter, a man often laughs at
Enter Input : what’s good and kind. That’s only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you,
Enter Input : boys, that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, ‘No, I do wrong
Enter Input : to laugh, for that’s not a thing to laugh at.’ ”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!” cried Kolya, with flashing
Enter Input : eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but they
Enter Input : restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “I say this in case we become bad,” Alyosha went on, “but there’s no
Enter Input : reason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be, first and
Enter Input : above all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other! I
Enter Input : say that again. I give you my word for my part that I’ll never forget one
Enter Input : of you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty
Enter Input : years. Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know
Enter Input : whether he exists or not. But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and
Enter Input : that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of
Enter Input : Troy, but is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys,
Enter Input : my dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave
Enter Input : and generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when he
Enter Input : is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as
Enter Input : Kartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all dear to me,
Enter Input : boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart for you all, and I
Enter Input : beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me! Well, and who has united us
Enter Input : in this kind, good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember
Enter Input : all our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to
Enter Input : us for ever! Let us never forget him. May his memory live for ever in our
Enter Input : hearts from this time forth!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!” the boys cried in their ringing voices,
Enter Input : with softened faces.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots, his
Enter Input : coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he stood up for him
Enter Input : alone against the whole school.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We will remember, we will remember,” cried the boys. “He was brave, he
Enter Input : was good!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, how I loved him!” exclaimed Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don’t be afraid of life! How good life is
Enter Input : when one does something good and just!”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Yes, yes,” the boys repeated enthusiastically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Karamazov, we love you!” a voice, probably Kartashov’s, cried
Enter Input : impulsively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “We love you, we love you!” they all caught it up. There were tears in the
Enter Input : eyes of many of them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya shouted ecstatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And may the dead boy’s memory live for ever!” Alyosha added again with
Enter Input : feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “For ever!” the boys chimed in again.

Enter Input : “Karamazov,” cried Kolya, “can it be true what’s taught us in religion,
Enter Input : that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each
Enter Input : other again, all, Ilusha too?”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other and
Enter Input : shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!”
Enter Input : Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Ah, how splendid it will be!” broke from Kolya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner. Don’t be
Enter Input : put out at our eating pancakes—it’s a very old custom and there’s
Enter Input : something nice in that!” laughed Alyosha. “Well, let us go! And now we go
Enter Input : hand in hand.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : “And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya
Enter Input : cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up his
Enter Input : exclamation: “Hurrah for Karamazov!”

Enter Input : FOOTNOTES
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     1 In Russian, “silen.”
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     2 A proverbial expression in Russia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     3 Grushenka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     4 i.e. setter dog.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     5 Probably the public event was the Decabrist plot against the Tsar,
Enter Input :       of December 1825, in which the most distinguished men in Russia were
Enter Input :       concerned.—TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     6 When a monk’s body is carried out from the cell to the church and
Enter Input :       from the church to the graveyard, the canticle “What earthly joy...”
Enter Input :       is sung. If the deceased was a priest as well as a monk the canticle
Enter Input :       “Our Helper and Defender” is sung instead.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     7 i.e. a chime of bells.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     8 Literally: “Did you get off with a long nose made at you?”—a
Enter Input :       proverbial expression in Russia for failure.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     9 Gogol is meant.

Enter Input :            Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
Enter Input : works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
Enter Input : obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
Enter Input : efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
Enter Input : of life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
Enter Input : they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
Enter Input : that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
Enter Input : generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Enter Input : Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Enter Input : Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Enter Input : Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
Enter Input : public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
Enter Input : number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
Enter Input : in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
Enter Input : including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
Enter Input : particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
Enter Input : charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Enter Input : Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
Enter Input : effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
Enter Input : requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
Enter Input : received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
Enter Input : determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
Enter Input : http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
Enter Input : not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
Enter Input : accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
Enter Input : with offers to donate.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
Enter Input : statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
Enter Input : United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Enter Input : and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

Enter Input :       General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
Enter Input : concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
Enter Input : anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
Enter Input : eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
Enter Input : all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
Enter Input : notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
Enter Input : with any particular paper edition.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
Enter Input : number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
Enter Input : (zipped), HTML and others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
Enter Input : old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
Enter Input : _Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
Enter Input : new filenames and etext numbers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :     http://www.gutenberg.org
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
Enter Input : to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
Enter Input : how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email

Enter Input : TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to
Enter Input : understand his work.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working
Enter Input : and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five
Enter Input : children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings
Enter Input : in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious
Enter Input : character.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the
Enter Input : final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had
Enter Input : already begun his first work, "Poor Folk."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and
Enter Input : was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself
Enter Input : instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career
Enter Input : seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he
Enter Input : was arrested.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky
Enter Input : was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier
Enter Input : and Proudhon. He was accused of "taking part in conversations against
Enter Input : the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of
Enter Input : knowing of the intention to set up a printing press." Under Nicholas
Enter Input : I. (that "stern and just man," as Maurice Baring calls him) this was
Enter Input : enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months' imprisonment
Enter Input : he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to
Enter Input : be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: "They snapped
Enter Input : words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by
Enter Input : persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,
Enter Input : to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only
Enter Input : a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and
Enter Input : I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to
Enter Input : bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,
Enter Input : brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared
Enter Input : us our lives." The sentence was commuted to hard labour.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and
Enter Input : never regained his sanity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on
Enter Input : Dostoevsky's mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to
Enter Input : accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing
Enter Input : in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.
Enter Input : He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the
Enter Input : cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal
Enter Input : servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where
Enter Input : he began the "Dead House," and some years of service in a disciplinary
Enter Input : battalion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest
Enter Input : and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he
Enter Input : suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times
Enter Input : a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was
Enter Input : allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--"Vremya," which was
Enter Input : forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost
Enter Input : his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet
Enter Input : he took upon himself the payment of his brother's debts. He started
Enter Input : another journal--"The Epoch," which within a few months was also
Enter Input : prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother's family was
Enter Input : dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is
Enter Input : said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were
Enter Input : much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the
Enter Input : monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary
Enter Input : demonstrations of love and honour.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a
Enter Input : vast multitude of mourners, who "gave the hapless man the funeral of a
Enter Input : king." He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling
Enter Input : inspired by Dostoevsky: "He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and
Enter Input : our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than
Enter Input : we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart
Enter Input : which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other
Enter Input : gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he
Enter Input : became great."

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of
Enter Input : the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though
Enter Input : in hesitation, towards K. bridge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
Enter Input : garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more
Enter Input : like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,
Enter Input : dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time
Enter Input : he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
Enter Input : invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a
Enter Input : sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was
Enter Input : hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but
Enter Input : for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,
Enter Input : verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in
Enter Input : himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not
Enter Input : only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the
Enter Input : anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had
Enter Input : given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all
Enter Input : desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror
Enter Input : for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
Enter Input : trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats
Enter Input : and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to
Enter Input : lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and
Enter Input : slip out unseen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
Enter Input : aware of his fears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these
Enter Input : trifles," he thought, with an odd smile. "Hm... yes, all is in a man's
Enter Input : hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would
Enter Input : be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new
Enter Input : step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking
Enter Input : too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is
Enter Input : that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this
Enter Input : last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the
Enter Input : Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is
Enter Input : _that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse
Enter Input : myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle
Enter Input : and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that
Enter Input : special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out
Enter Input : of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's already
Enter Input : overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which
Enter Input : are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men
Enter Input : whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed
Enter Input : the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest
Enter Input : disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face. He was,
Enter Input : by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,
Enter Input : well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank
Enter Input : into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness
Enter Input : of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
Enter Input : to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the
Enter Input : habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these
Enter Input : moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a
Enter Input : tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted
Enter Input : food.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
Enter Input : have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter
Enter Input : of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have
Enter Input : created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number
Enter Input : of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading
Enter Input : and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the
Enter Input : heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets
Enter Input : that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was
Enter Input : such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that,
Enter Input : in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least
Enter Input : of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with
Enter Input : acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked
Enter Input : meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown
Enter Input : reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy
Enter Input : dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: "Hey there, German
Enter Input : hatter" bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young
Enter Input : man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall
Enter Input : round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all
Enter Input : torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly
Enter Input : fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror
Enter Input : had overtaken him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew it," he muttered in confusion, "I thought so! That's the worst
Enter Input : of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might
Enter Input : spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd
Enter Input : and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any
Enter Input : sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such
Enter Input : a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What
Enter Input : matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them
Enter Input : a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as
Enter Input : possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it's just such
Enter Input : trifles that always ruin everything...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
Enter Input : of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted
Enter Input : them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no
Enter Input : faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous
Enter Input : but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon
Enter Input : them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at
Enter Input : his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard
Enter Input : this "hideous" dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he
Enter Input : still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a
Enter Input : "rehearsal" of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more
Enter Input : and more violent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house
Enter Input : which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the
Enter Input : street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
Enter Input : working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of
Enter Input : sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.
Enter Input : There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
Enter Input : two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on
Enter Input : the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and
Enter Input : at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the
Enter Input : staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar
Enter Input : with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:
Enter Input : in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that
Enter Input : I were really going to do it?" he could not help asking himself as he
Enter Input : reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters
Enter Input : who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the
Enter Input : flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his
Enter Input : family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this
Enter Input : staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. "That's a good
Enter Input : thing anyway," he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old
Enter Input : woman's flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of
Enter Input : tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells
Enter Input : that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now
Enter Input : its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it
Enter Input : clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained
Enter Input : by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old
Enter Input : woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and
Enter Input : nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.
Enter Input : But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and
Enter Input : opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which
Enter Input : was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing
Enter Input : him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,
Enter Input : withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp
Enter Input : little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared
Enter Input : with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,
Enter Input : which looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,
Enter Input : and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy
Enter Input : fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every
Enter Input : instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
Enter Input : expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago," the young man made
Enter Input : haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more
Enter Input : polite.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here," the
Enter Input : old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And here... I am again on the same errand," Raskolnikov continued, a
Enter Input : little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust. "Perhaps
Enter Input : she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other
Enter Input : time," he thought with an uneasy feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,
Enter Input : and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass
Enter Input : in front of her:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Step in, my good sir."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on
Enter Input : the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly
Enter Input : lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!" flashed as it were by
Enter Input : chance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned
Enter Input : everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and
Enter Input : remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The
Enter Input : furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with
Enter Input : a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a
Enter Input : dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,
Enter Input : chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow
Enter Input : frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was
Enter Input : all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything
Enter Input : was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;
Enter Input : everything shone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta's work," thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust
Enter Input : to be seen in the whole flat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such
Enter Input : cleanliness," Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance
Enter Input : at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in
Enter Input : which stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which he
Enter Input : had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want?" the old woman said severely, coming into the room
Enter Input : and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in
Enter Input : the face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've brought something to pawn here," and he drew out of his pocket
Enter Input : an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a
Enter Input : globe; the chain was of steel.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day
Enter Input : before yesterday."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell
Enter Input : your pledge at once."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You come with such trifles, my good sir, it's scarcely worth anything.
Enter Input : I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it
Enter Input : quite new at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's. I
Enter Input : shall be getting some money soon."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A rouble and a half!" cried the young man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Please yourself"--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The
Enter Input : young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going
Enter Input : away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere
Enter Input : else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hand it over," he said roughly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind
Enter Input : the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in
Enter Input : the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear
Enter Input : her unlocking the chest of drawers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It must be the top drawer," he reflected. "So she carries the keys in
Enter Input : a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there's
Enter Input : one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;
Enter Input : that can't be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some
Enter Input : other chest or strong-box... that's worth knowing. Strong-boxes always
Enter Input : have keys like that... but how degrading it all is."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old woman came back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take
Enter Input : fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But
Enter Input : for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks
Enter Input : on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks
Enter Input : altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the
Enter Input : watch. Here it is."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Just so."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the
Enter Input : old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still
Enter Input : something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know
Enter Input : what.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona
Enter Input : Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it
Enter Input : back from a friend..." he broke off in confusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, we will talk about it then, sir."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with
Enter Input : you?" He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the
Enter Input : passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What business is she of yours, my good sir?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,
Enter Input : Alyona Ivanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more
Enter Input : and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two
Enter Input : or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was
Enter Input : in the street he cried out, "Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and
Enter Input : can I, can I possibly.... No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!" he added
Enter Input : resolutely. "And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
Enter Input : What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,
Enter Input : disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been...."
Enter Input : But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling
Enter Input : of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart
Enter Input : while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a
Enter Input : pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to
Enter Input : do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the
Enter Input : pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling
Enter Input : against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next
Enter Input : street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern
Enter Input : which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
Enter Input : At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and
Enter Input : supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to
Enter Input : think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had
Enter Input : never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a
Enter Input : burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his
Enter Input : sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little
Enter Input : table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank
Enter Input : off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became
Enter Input : clear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All that's nonsense," he said hopefully, "and there is nothing in it
Enter Input : all to worry about! It's simply physical derangement. Just a glass of
Enter Input : beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,
Enter Input : the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all
Enter Input : is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful
Enter Input : as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed
Enter Input : round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that
Enter Input : moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also
Enter Input : not normal.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken
Enter Input : men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and
Enter Input : a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure
Enter Input : left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern
Enter Input : were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,
Enter Input : sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with
Enter Input : a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had
Enter Input : dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in
Enter Input : his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper
Enter Input : part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some
Enter Input : meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :    "His wife a year he fondly loved
Enter Input :     His wife a--a year he--fondly loved."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Or suddenly waking up again:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :    "Walking along the crowded row
Enter Input :     He met the one he used to know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with
Enter Input : positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was
Enter Input : another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government
Enter Input : clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and
Enter Input : looking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided
Enter Input : society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he
Enter Input : felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking
Enter Input : place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He
Enter Input : was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
Enter Input : excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other
Enter Input : world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the
Enter Input : surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently
Enter Input : came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with
Enter Input : red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his
Enter Input : person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,
Enter Input : with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an
Enter Input : iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was
Enter Input : another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the
Enter Input : counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and
Enter Input : some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably
Enter Input : close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such
Enter Input : an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the
Enter Input : first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on
Enter Input : Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked
Enter Input : like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression
Enter Input : afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly
Enter Input : at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring
Enter Input : persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At
Enter Input : the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk
Enter Input : looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing
Enter Input : a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and
Enter Input : culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to
Enter Input : converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,
Enter Input : and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of
Enter Input : a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen
Enter Input : reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very
Enter Input : strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense
Enter Input : feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the
Enter Input : same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an
Enter Input : old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing
Enter Input : except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this
Enter Input : last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots
Enter Input : and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore
Enter Input : no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin
Enter Input : looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable
Enter Input : and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he
Enter Input : ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his
Enter Input : hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky
Enter Input : table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and
Enter Input : resolutely:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?
Enter Input : Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my
Enter Input : experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not
Enter Input : accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in
Enter Input : conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular
Enter Input : counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I
Enter Input : make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I am studying," answered the young man, somewhat surprised at
Enter Input : the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly
Enter Input : addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for
Enter Input : company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his
Enter Input : habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached
Enter Input : or attempted to approach him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A student then, or formerly a student," cried the clerk. "Just what
Enter Input : I thought! I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir," and he
Enter Input : tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. "You've been a
Enter Input : student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me...."
Enter Input : He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside
Enter Input : the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke
Enter Input : fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his
Enter Input : sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as
Enter Input : greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Honoured sir," he began almost with solemnity, "poverty is not a vice,
Enter Input : that's a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,
Enter Input : and that that's even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a
Enter Input : vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but
Enter Input : in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human
Enter Input : society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as
Enter Input : humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary
Enter Input : I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!
Enter Input : Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and
Enter Input : my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me
Enter Input : to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent
Enter Input : a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I have not happened to," answered Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've slept
Enter Input : so...." He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in
Enter Input : fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite
Enter Input : probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
Enter Input : His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black
Enter Input : nails.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The
Enter Input : boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the
Enter Input : upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the "funny fellow"
Enter Input : and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.
Enter Input : Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most
Enter Input : likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of
Enter Input : frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in
Enter Input : the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and
Enter Input : especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order
Enter Input : at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify
Enter Input : themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Funny fellow!" pronounced the innkeeper. "And why don't you work, why
Enter Input : aren't you at your duty, if you are in the service?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir," Marmeladov went on, addressing
Enter Input : himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put
Enter Input : that question to him. "Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache
Enter Input : to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov
Enter Input : beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer?
Enter Input : Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to
Enter Input : petition hopelessly for a loan?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you
Enter Input : will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive
Enter Input : certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will
Enter Input : on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?
Enter Input : For he knows of course that I shan't pay it back. From compassion? But
Enter Input : Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day
Enter Input : that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that's
Enter Input : what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I
Enter Input : ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that
Enter Input : he won't, I set off to him and..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why do you go?" put in Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must
Enter Input : have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must
Enter Input : go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,
Enter Input : then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport)," he added
Enter Input : in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.
Enter Input : "No matter, sir, no matter!" he went on hurriedly and with apparent
Enter Input : composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the
Enter Input : innkeeper smiled--"No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of
Enter Input : their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all
Enter Input : that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but
Enter Input : with humility. So be it! So be it! 'Behold the man!' Excuse me, young
Enter Input : man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not
Enter Input : _can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man did not answer a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well," the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,
Enter Input : after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. "Well, so be
Enter Input : it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer's
Enter Input : daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a
Enter Input : noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,
Enter Input : if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man
Enter Input : ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although
Enter Input : I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for
Enter Input : I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," he
Enter Input : declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--"but, my
Enter Input : God, if she would but once.... But no, no! It's all in vain and it's no
Enter Input : use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true
Enter Input : and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a
Enter Input : beast by nature!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rather!" assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist
Enter Input : resolutely on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very
Enter Input : stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the
Enter Input : order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!
Enter Input : Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own
Enter Input : property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this
Enter Input : winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three
Enter Input : little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till
Enter Input : night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she's
Enter Input : been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has
Enter Input : a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don't feel it?
Enter Input : And the more I drink the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try
Enter Input : to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer
Enter Input : twice as much!" And as though in despair he laid his head down on the
Enter Input : table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Young man," he went on, raising his head again, "in your face I seem to
Enter Input : read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why
Enter Input : I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I
Enter Input : do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,
Enter Input : who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man
Enter Input : of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a
Enter Input : high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she
Enter Input : danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for
Enter Input : which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
Enter Input : The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the
Enter Input : certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed
Enter Input : it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms
Enter Input : with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past
Enter Input : honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don't condemn her for
Enter Input : it, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of
Enter Input : the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady
Enter Input : of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has
Enter Input : nothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treated
Enter Input : with disrespect. That's why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov's
Enter Input : rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to
Enter Input : her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was
Enter Input : a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the
Enter Input : other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and
Enter Input : ran away with him from her father's house. She was exceedingly fond of
Enter Input : her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he
Enter Input : died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of
Enter Input : which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of
Enter Input : him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad
Enter Input : that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having
Enter Input : once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in
Enter Input : a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she
Enter Input : was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups
Enter Input : and downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even. Her
Enter Input : relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively
Enter Input : proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a
Enter Input : widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered
Enter Input : her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can
Enter Input : judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education
Enter Input : and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my
Enter Input : wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she
Enter Input : married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you
Enter Input : understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,
Enter Input : that you don't understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed
Enter Input : my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this" (he
Enter Input : tapped the jug with his finger), "for I have feelings. But even so, I
Enter Input : could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no
Enter Input : fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch
Enter Input : it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at
Enter Input : last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent
Enter Input : capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a
Enter Input : situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This
Enter Input : time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come
Enter Input : out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's;
Enter Input : and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.
Enter Input : There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and
Enter Input : disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by
Enter Input : my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with
Enter Input : from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won't speak of. For,
Enter Input : though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited
Enter Input : lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it's no use going over
Enter Input : that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an
Enter Input : effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal
Enter Input : history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we
Enter Input : had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not
Enter Input : even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at
Enter Input : Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read
Enter Input : other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great
Enter Input : interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology--do
Enter Input : you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's the
Enter Input : whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured
Enter Input : sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that
Enter Input : a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen
Enter Input : farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special
Enter Input : talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what's
Enter Input : more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of
Enter Input : him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she
Enter Input : made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the
Enter Input : pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were
Enter Input : put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed
Enter Input : red, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' says
Enter Input : she, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.'
Enter Input : And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the
Enter Input : little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of
Enter Input : it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle
Enter Input : creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin
Enter Input : little face). She said: 'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing
Enter Input : like that?' And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very
Enter Input : well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her
Enter Input : through the landlady. 'And why not?' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,
Enter Input : 'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!' But don't blame
Enter Input : her, don't blame her, honoured sir, don't blame her! She was not herself
Enter Input : when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying
Enter Input : of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything
Enter Input : else.... For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when children
Enter Input : cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o'clock
Enter Input : I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the
Enter Input : room and about nine o'clock she came back. She walked straight up to
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her
Enter Input : in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she
Enter Input : simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,
Enter Input : made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down
Enter Input : on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
Enter Input : body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....
Enter Input : And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence
Enter Input : go up to Sonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
Enter Input : kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell
Enter Input : asleep in each other's arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay
Enter Input : drunk."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he
Enter Input : hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Since then, sir," he went on after a brief pause--"Since then, owing
Enter Input : to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by
Enter Input : evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a
Enter Input : leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of
Enter Input : respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take
Enter Input : a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with
Enter Input : us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though
Enter Input : she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
Enter Input : hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia's
Enter Input : account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of
Enter Input : a sudden he stood on his dignity: 'how,' said he, 'can a highly educated
Enter Input : man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?' And Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that's
Enter Input : how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she
Enter Input : comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room
Enter Input : at the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is
Enter Input : a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft
Enter Input : palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one
Enter Input : room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor
Enter Input : people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,
Enter Input : and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his
Enter Input : excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you
Enter Input : know him? No? Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know. He is wax...
Enter Input : wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were
Enter Input : dim when he heard my story. 'Marmeladov, once already you have
Enter Input : deceived my expectations... I'll take you once more on my own
Enter Input : responsibility'--that's what he said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now you
Enter Input : can go.' I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality
Enter Input : he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of
Enter Input : modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I
Enter Input : announced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive a
Enter Input : salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole
Enter Input : party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds
Enter Input : of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven
Enter Input : singing "The Hamlet" were heard in the entry. The room was filled with
Enter Input : noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
Enter Input : Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
Enter Input : He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more
Enter Input : drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his
Enter Input : recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was
Enter Input : positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : listened attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the
Enter Input : kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but
Enter Input : abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. 'Semyon
Enter Input : Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!'
Enter Input : They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They
Enter Input : began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed
Enter Input : to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty
Enter Input : copecks, I can't guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,
Enter Input : a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and
Enter Input : a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with
Enter Input : horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any
Enter Input : dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going
Enter Input : on a visit; and not that she'd anything to do it with, she smartened
Enter Input : herself up with nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on a
Enter Input : clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different
Enter Input : person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,
Enter Input : had only helped with money 'for the time,' she said, 'it won't do for me
Enter Input : to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.' Do
Enter Input : you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you
Enter Input : think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with
Enter Input : our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not
Enter Input : resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,
Enter Input : whispering together. 'Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,
Enter Input : now, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he went himself to his
Enter Input : excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the
Enter Input : others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into
Enter Input : his study.' Do you hear, do you hear? 'To be sure,' says he, 'Semyon
Enter Input : Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spite
Enter Input : of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and
Enter Input : since moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do you
Enter Input : hear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.' And
Enter Input : all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not
Enter Input : simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it
Enter Input : all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she
Enter Input : does! And I don't blame her for it, no, I don't blame her!... Six days
Enter Input : ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles
Enter Input : forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: 'poppet,' said she,
Enter Input : 'my little poppet.' And when we were by ourselves, you understand?
Enter Input : You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a
Enter Input : husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, 'my little poppet,'
Enter Input : said she."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began
Enter Input : to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded
Enter Input : appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of
Enter Input : spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered
Enter Input : his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
Enter Input : He felt vexed that he had come here.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Honoured sir, honoured sir," cried Marmeladov recovering himself--"Oh,
Enter Input : sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to
Enter Input : others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
Enter Input : trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
Enter Input : For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
Enter Input : and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
Enter Input : arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should
Enter Input : give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour
Enter Input : and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....
Enter Input : Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir" (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort
Enter Input : of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) "well, on
Enter Input : the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five
Enter Input : days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,
Enter Input : I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was
Enter Input : left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look
Enter Input : at me, all of you! It's the fifth day since I left home, and they are
Enter Input : looking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniform
Enter Input : is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the
Enter Input : garments I have on... and it's the end of everything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed
Enter Input : his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute
Enter Input : later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
Enter Input : affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
Enter Input : He-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't say she gave it to you?" cried one of the new-comers; he
Enter Input : shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This very quart was bought with her money," Marmeladov declared,
Enter Input : addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. "Thirty copecks she gave
Enter Input : me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said
Enter Input : nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up
Enter Input : yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them,
Enter Input : they don't blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don't
Enter Input : blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do
Enter Input : you think, my dear sir? For now she's got to keep up her appearance. It
Enter Input : costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you
Enter Input : understand? And there's pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;
Enter Input : petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her
Enter Input : foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you
Enter Input : understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,
Enter Input : here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking
Enter Input : it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like
Enter Input : me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry
Enter Input : or not? He-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was
Enter Input : empty.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you to be pitied for?" shouted the tavern-keeper who was again
Enter Input : near them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths
Enter Input : came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
Enter Input : nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged
Enter Input : government clerk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?" Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,
Enter Input : standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only
Enter Input : waiting for that question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there's nothing to pity me for! I
Enter Input : ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,
Enter Input : oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be
Enter Input : crucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...
Enter Input : Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been
Enter Input : sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and
Enter Input : tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity
Enter Input : us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all
Enter Input : things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day
Enter Input : and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,
Enter Input : consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is
Enter Input : the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,
Enter Input : undismayed by his beastliness?' And He will say, 'Come to me! I have
Enter Input : already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins
Enter Input : which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....' And he
Enter Input : will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my
Enter Input : heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive
Enter Input : all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has
Enter Input : done with all of them, then He will summon us. 'You too come forth,'
Enter Input : He will say, 'Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come
Enter Input : forth, ye children of shame!' And we shall all come forth, without shame
Enter Input : and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, made
Enter Input : in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!' And the
Enter Input : wise ones and those of understanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thou
Enter Input : receive these men?' And He will say, 'This is why I receive them, oh ye
Enter Input : wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one
Enter Input : of them believed himself to be worthy of this.' And He will hold out His
Enter Input : hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...
Enter Input : and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and
Enter Input : all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....
Enter Input : Lord, Thy kingdom come!" And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and
Enter Input : helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings
Enter Input : and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;
Enter Input : there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard
Enter Input : again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's his notion!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Talked himself silly!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A fine clerk he is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And so on, and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let us go, sir," said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and
Enter Input : addressing Raskolnikov--"come along with me... Kozel's house, looking
Enter Input : into the yard. I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to
Enter Input : help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech
Enter Input : and leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred
Enter Input : paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and
Enter Input : confusion as they drew nearer the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he muttered in
Enter Input : agitation--"and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair
Enter Input : matter! Bother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will be better if
Enter Input : she does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of... it's her
Enter Input : eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,
Enter Input : frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people
Enter Input : in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of
Enter Input : the children's crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...
Enter Input : I don't know what's happened! I don't know! But blows I am not afraid
Enter Input : of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an
Enter Input : enjoyment. In fact I can't get on without it.... It's better so. Let
Enter Input : her strike me, it relieves her heart... it's better so... There is the
Enter Input : house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.
Enter Input : Lead the way!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase
Enter Input : got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o'clock
Enter Input : and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was
Enter Input : quite dark at the top of the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very
Enter Input : poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;
Enter Input : the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,
Enter Input : littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments.
Enter Input : Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it
Enter Input : probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs
Enter Input : and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which
Enter Input : stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge
Enter Input : of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It
Enter Input : appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,
Enter Input : but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other
Enter Input : rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat was
Enter Input : divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter
Enter Input : within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words
Enter Input : of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,
Enter Input : slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
Enter Input : hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down
Enter Input : in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
Enter Input : were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes
Enter Input : glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And
Enter Input : that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
Enter Input : candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
Enter Input : Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
Enter Input : She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room
Enter Input : was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
Enter Input : staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner
Enter Input : rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not
Enter Input : close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting
Enter Input : curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older
Enter Input : stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a
Enter Input : beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,
Enter Input : wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung
Enter Input : over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.
Enter Input : Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother's neck. She was
Enter Input : trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she
Enter Input : could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large
Enter Input : dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened
Enter Input : face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the
Enter Input : door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov
Enter Input : in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently
Enter Input : facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what
Enter Input : he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into
Enter Input : the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no
Enter Input : further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it
Enter Input : and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the
Enter Input : doorway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah!" she cried out in a frenzy, "he has come back! The criminal! the
Enter Input : monster!... And where is the money? What's in your pocket, show me! And
Enter Input : your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the
Enter Input : money! Speak!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently
Enter Input : held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where is the money?" she cried--"Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?
Enter Input : There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!" and in a fury
Enter Input : she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov
Enter Input : seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a
Enter Input : positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir," he called out, shaken to and
Enter Input : fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.
Enter Input : The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the
Enter Input : corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed
Enter Input : to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was
Enter Input : shaking like a leaf.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's drunk it! he's drunk it all," the poor woman screamed in
Enter Input : despair--"and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!"--and
Enter Input : wringing her hands she pointed to the children. "Oh, accursed life!
Enter Input : And you, are you not ashamed?"--she pounced all at once upon
Enter Input : Raskolnikov--"from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have
Enter Input : been drinking with him, too! Go away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door
Enter Input : was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse
Enter Input : laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
Enter Input : themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in
Enter Input : dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of
Enter Input : them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when
Enter Input : Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation
Enter Input : to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill
Enter Input : outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her
Enter Input : way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and
Enter Input : for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her
Enter Input : with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the
Enter Input : coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to
Enter Input : lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed
Enter Input : his mind and would have gone back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a stupid thing I've done," he thought to himself, "they have Sonia
Enter Input : and I want it myself." But reflecting that it would be impossible to
Enter Input : take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he
Enter Input : dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.
Enter Input : "Sonia wants pomatum too," he said as he walked along the street, and he
Enter Input : laughed malignantly--"such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia
Enter Input : herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting
Enter Input : big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
Enter Input : to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they've dug
Enter Input : there! And they're making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most
Enter Input : of it! They've wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to
Enter Input : everything, the scoundrel!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sank into thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if I am wrong," he cried suddenly after a moment's thought.
Enter Input : "What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the
Enter Input : whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial
Enter Input : terrors and there are no barriers and it's all as it should be."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not
Enter Input : refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked
Enter Input : with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six
Enter Input : paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty
Enter Input : yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man
Enter Input : of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment
Enter Input : that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in
Enter Input : keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a
Enter Input : painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;
Enter Input : the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long
Enter Input : untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and
Enter Input : half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but
Enter Input : was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep
Enter Input : on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old
Enter Input : student's overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he
Enter Input : heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A
Enter Input : little table stood in front of the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.
Enter Input : He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,
Enter Input : and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked
Enter Input : sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was
Enter Input : in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated
Enter Input : upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending
Enter Input : him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,
Enter Input : though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,
Enter Input : was rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given up
Enter Input : sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into
Enter Input : his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get up, why are you asleep?" she called to him. "It's past nine, I have
Enter Input : brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you're fairly
Enter Input : starving?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From the landlady, eh?" he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting
Enter Input : up on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From the landlady, indeed!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and
Enter Input : laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here, Nastasya, take it please," he said, fumbling in his pocket (for
Enter Input : he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--"run
Enter Input : and buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the
Enter Input : pork-butcher's."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather have
Enter Input : some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It's capital soup, yesterday's. I
Enter Input : saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It's fine soup."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya
Enter Input : sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country
Enter Input : peasant-woman and a very talkative one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you," she
Enter Input : said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He scowled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To the police? What does she want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't pay her money and you won't turn out of the room. That's what
Enter Input : she wants, to be sure."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The devil, that's the last straw," he muttered, grinding his teeth,
Enter Input : "no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool," he added aloud.
Enter Input : "I'll go and talk to her to-day."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so
Enter Input : clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One
Enter Input : time you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you
Enter Input : do nothing now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am doing..." Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you doing?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Work..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What sort of work?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am thinking," he answered seriously after a pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter
Enter Input : and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and
Enter Input : shaking all over till she felt ill.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And have you made much money by your thinking?" she managed to
Enter Input : articulate at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One can't go out to give lessons without boots. And I'm sick of it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't quarrel with your bread and butter."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They pay so little for lessons. What's the use of a few coppers?" he
Enter Input : answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you want to get a fortune all at once?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked at her strangely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I want a fortune," he answered firmly, after a brief pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the
Enter Input : loaf or not?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you please."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A letter? for me! from whom?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will
Enter Input : you pay me back?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it," cried Raskolnikov
Enter Input : greatly excited--"good God!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,
Enter Input : from the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a
Enter Input : long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also
Enter Input : suddenly stabbed his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your three
Enter Input : copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her
Enter Input : presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya
Enter Input : had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he
Enter Input : gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear
Enter Input : and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.
Enter Input : He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;
Enter Input : it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets
Enter Input : of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My dear Rodya," wrote his mother--"it's two months since I last had a
Enter Input : talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me
Enter Input : awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my
Enter Input : inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look
Enter Input : to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a
Enter Input : grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university
Enter Input : some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had
Enter Input : lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my
Enter Input : hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent
Enter Input : you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,
Enter Input : from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a
Enter Input : kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too. But having given
Enter Input : him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was
Enter Input : paid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to send
Enter Input : you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall
Enter Input : be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate
Enter Input : ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In
Enter Input : the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister
Enter Input : has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be
Enter Input : separated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will
Enter Input : tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything
Enter Input : has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you
Enter Input : wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great
Enter Input : deal to put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs' house, when you wrote that
Enter Input : and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to
Enter Input : you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have
Enter Input : thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all
Enter Input : the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not
Enter Input : let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I
Enter Input : do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What
Enter Input : made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles
Enter Input : in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on
Enter Input : condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it
Enter Input : was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
Enter Input : This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took
Enter Input : chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly
Enter Input : then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,
Enter Input : writing that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was not
Enter Input : so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have
Enter Input : suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves
Enter Input : you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated
Enter Input : her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at
Enter Input : table.... But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so as
Enter Input : not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite
Enter Input : of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov's
Enter Input : wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,
Enter Input : especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental
Enter Input : habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it
Enter Input : was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had
Enter Input : conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed
Enter Input : it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and
Enter Input : horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and
Enter Input : his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.
Enter Input : And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide
Enter Input : the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face
Enter Input : to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of
Enter Input : inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her
Enter Input : to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went
Enter Input : through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on
Enter Input : account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia
Enter Input : would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would
Enter Input : have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been
Enter Input : inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could
Enter Input : not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know
Enter Input : Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
Enter Input : has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases
Enter Input : she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write
Enter Input : to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were
Enter Input : constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the
Enter Input : garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw
Enter Input : the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful
Enter Input : scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna
Enter Input : went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was
Enter Input : shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should
Enter Input : be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which they
Enter Input : flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without
Enter Input : folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,
Enter Input : and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an
Enter Input : open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer
Enter Input : could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and
Enter Input : what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to
Enter Input : you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified
Enter Input : and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin
Enter Input : yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter
Enter Input : with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a
Enter Input : whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came
Enter Input : to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account
Enter Input : of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about
Enter Input : us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the
Enter Input : street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to
Enter Input : insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,
Enter Input : so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set
Enter Input : going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at
Enter Input : her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that
Enter Input : month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is
Enter Input : rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and
Enter Input : particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not
Enter Input : at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in
Enter Input : the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but
Enter Input : Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how
Enter Input : she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is
Enter Input : an angel! But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably
Enter Input : feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and
Enter Input : unmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia
Enter Input : had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna
Enter Input : came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov's hands after her departure, she had written to refuse
Enter Input : personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating
Enter Input : her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation
Enter Input : for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding
Enter Input : him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how
Enter Input : infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,
Enter Input : unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and
Enter Input : touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot
Enter Input : read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,
Enter Input : cleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more
Enter Input : than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case
Enter Input : with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and 'again
Enter Input : crushed' as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of
Enter Input : Dounia's innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight
Enter Input : to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give
Enter Input : her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she
Enter Input : came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept
Enter Input : bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to
Enter Input : forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all
Enter Input : the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in
Enter Input : the most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility of
Enter Input : her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to
Enter Input : everyone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and
Enter Input : even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was
Enter Input : superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about
Enter Input : the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence
Enter Input : having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so
Enter Input : that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone
Enter Input : knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the
Enter Input : letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading
Enter Input : of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their
Enter Input : own houses and in other people's. In my opinion a great deal, a very
Enter Input : great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's
Enter Input : character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's
Enter Input : reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible
Enter Input : disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really
Enter Input : began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too
Enter Input : harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,
Enter Input : but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked
Enter Input : respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may
Enter Input : say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,
Enter Input : that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry
Enter Input : him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been
Enter Input : arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved
Enter Input : with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we
Enter Input : could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you
Enter Input : could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This
Enter Input : was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who
Enter Input : has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his
Enter Input : expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was
Enter Input : properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent
Enter Input : us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a
Enter Input : speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry
Enter Input : to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,
Enter Input : of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly
Enter Input : and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a
Enter Input : well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government
Enter Input : and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years
Enter Input : old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be
Enter Input : thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and
Enter Input : presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
Enter Input : But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
Enter Input : And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will
Enter Input : do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if
Enter Input : there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this
Enter Input : warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression
Enter Input : upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be
Enter Input : deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,
Enter Input : which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.
Enter Input : At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but
Enter Input : still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions 'of our
Enter Input : most rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He
Enter Input : said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be
Enter Input : listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very
Enter Input : little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man
Enter Input : of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know
Enter Input : your sister's character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and
Enter Input : generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.
Enter Input : Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but
Enter Input : Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make
Enter Input : it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her
Enter Input : happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it
Enter Input : must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he
Enter Input : is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that
Enter Input : his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with
Enter Input : him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even
Enter Input : certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in
Enter Input : the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she
Enter Input : relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and
Enter Input : that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future
Enter Input : relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,
Enter Input : for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come
Enter Input : from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For
Enter Input : instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent,
Enter Input : in the course of conversation, he declared that before making
Enter Input : Dounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of
Enter Input : good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced
Enter Input : poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his
Enter Input : wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
Enter Input : benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely
Enter Input : than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only
Enter Input : remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,
Enter Input : but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards
Enter Input : to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike
Enter Input : me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was
Enter Input : vexed, and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is
Enter Input : perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up
Enter Input : her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was
Enter Input : walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before
Enter Input : the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me
Enter Input : that she had decided.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for
Enter Input : Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open
Enter Input : a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil
Enter Input : and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important
Enter Input : case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before
Enter Input : the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in
Enter Input : every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day
Enter Input : you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that
Enter Input : your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to
Enter Input : pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a
Enter Input : providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even
Enter Input : ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.
Enter Input : He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not
Enter Input : get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to
Enter Input : a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the
Enter Input : duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then
Enter Input : he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave
Enter Input : you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but
Enter Input : Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever
Enter Input : for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for
Enter Input : your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a
Enter Input : student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share
Enter Input : all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of
Enter Input : realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very
Enter Input : natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly
Enter Input : persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her
Enter Input : future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful
Enter Input : not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,
Enter Input : especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might
Enter Input : take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor
Enter Input : has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
Enter Input : of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
Enter Input : of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,
Enter Input : later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
Enter Input : himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
Enter Input : you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and
Enter Input : receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your
Enter Input : own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree
Enter Input : with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that
Enter Input : is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when
Enter Input : you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about
Enter Input : you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing
Enter Input : him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own
Enter Input : opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious
Enter Input : Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,
Enter Input : fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with
Enter Input : them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and
Enter Input : delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter
Enter Input : for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is
Enter Input : simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have
Enter Input : noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with
Enter Input : their mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's
Enter Input : way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so
Enter Input : long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and
Enter Input : Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most
Enter Input : joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:
Enter Input : know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a
Enter Input : very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of
Enter Input : almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to
Enter Input : set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon,
Enter Input : possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us
Enter Input : know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his
Enter Input : own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,
Enter Input : even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is
Enter Input : too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall
Enter Input : press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought
Enter Input : of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing
Enter Input : anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,
Enter Input : so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for
Enter Input : a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting
Enter Input : herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But
Enter Input : although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much
Enter Input : money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia
Enter Input : is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know
Enter Input : that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles
Enter Input : on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send
Enter Input : you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am
Enter Input : uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has
Enter Input : been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that
Enter Input : is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big
Enter Input : trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we
Enter Input : must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we
Enter Input : can't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But
Enter Input : we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see
Enter Input : that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from
Enter Input : us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we
Enter Input : know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel
Enter Input : quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send
Enter Input : to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered
Enter Input : two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole
Enter Input : history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,
Enter Input : I embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet. Love Dounia
Enter Input : your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she
Enter Input : loves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,
Enter Input : Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If
Enter Input : only you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,
Enter Input : Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am
Enter Input : afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of
Enter Input : infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,
Enter Input : dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used
Enter Input : to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those
Enter Input : days. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with
Enter Input : many kisses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yours till death,
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov's face was
Enter Input : wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted
Enter Input : and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his
Enter Input : head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long
Enter Input : time. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.
Enter Input : At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was
Enter Input : like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He
Enter Input : took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting
Enter Input : anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the
Enter Input : Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though
Enter Input : hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without
Enter Input : noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the
Enter Input : astonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His mother's letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief
Enter Input : fact in it, he had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he was
Enter Input : reading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably
Enter Input : settled, in his mind: "Never such a marriage while I am alive and
Enter Input : Mr. Luzhin be damned!" "The thing is perfectly clear," he muttered
Enter Input : to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his
Enter Input : decision. "No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! and then they
Enter Input : apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without
Enter Input : me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can't be broken
Enter Input : off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:
Enter Input : 'Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in
Enter Input : post-haste, almost by express.' No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what
Enter Input : you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when
Enter Input : you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before
Enter Input : the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom. Bitter is
Enter Input : the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have
Enter Input : determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one
Enter Input : who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much
Enter Input : more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who
Enter Input : shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and
Enter Input : who _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats
Enter Input : everything! And that very Dounia for that very '_seems_' is marrying
Enter Input : him! Splendid! splendid!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our
Enter Input : most rising generation'? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea
Enter Input : of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!
Enter Input : I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one
Enter Input : another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into
Enter Input : _words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart
Enter Input : and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and
Enter Input : better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from
Enter Input : mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and
Enter Input : mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was
Enter Input : sure to be vexed and 'answered her angrily.' I should think so! Who
Enter Input : would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions
Enter Input : and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why
Enter Input : does she write to me, 'love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than
Enter Input : herself'? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter
Enter Input : to her son? 'You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh,
Enter Input : mother!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to
Enter Input : meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm... yes, that's true," he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that
Enter Input : chased each other in his brain, "it is true that 'it needs time and care
Enter Input : to get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The
Enter Input : chief thing is he is 'a man of business and _seems_ kind,' that was
Enter Input : something, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,
Enter Input : no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a
Enter Input : peasant's cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in
Enter Input : it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel very
Enter Input : comfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One
Enter Input : must cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr.
Enter Input : Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has
Enter Input : to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it's a matter
Enter Input : of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and
Enter Input : expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The
Enter Input : business man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less
Enter Input : than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they
Enter Input : don't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see? And
Enter Input : they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first
Enter Input : blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really
Enter Input : matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_
Enter Input : of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it's a
Enter Input : foretaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will
Enter Input : she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or
Enter Input : two 'paper ones' as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does
Enter Input : she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons
Enter Input : already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the
Enter Input : marriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let
Enter Input : slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'I
Enter Input : shall refuse,' says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting
Enter Input : on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when
Enter Input : Afanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and
Enter Input : embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don't add
Enter Input : more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know
Enter Input : that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin's
Enter Input : generosity; 'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.'
Enter Input : You may wait a long time for that! That's how it always is with these
Enter Input : Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan
Enter Input : with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see
Enter Input : nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of
Enter Input : the picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to; the
Enter Input : very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with
Enter Input : both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool's
Enter Input : cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin
Enter Input : has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and
Enter Input : that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
Enter Input : He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound
Enter Input : him!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well,... mother I don't wonder at, it's like her, God bless her, but
Enter Input : how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were
Enter Input : nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes
Enter Input : that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal.' I know that very well. I
Enter Input : knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half
Enter Input : years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that 'Dounia
Enter Input : can put up with a great deal.' If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And
Enter Input : now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up
Enter Input : with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of
Enter Input : wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband's
Enter Input : bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted
Enter Input : that he 'let it slip,' though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it
Enter Input : was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
Enter Input : possible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but
Enter Input : she will have to live with the man. Why! she'd live on black bread
Enter Input : and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral
Enter Input : freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,
Enter Input : much less Mr. Luzhin's money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew
Enter Input : her and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there's no denying,
Enter Input : the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It's a bitter thing to spend one's
Enter Input : life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know
Enter Input : she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German
Enter Input : master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself
Enter Input : for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has
Enter Input : nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of
Enter Input : unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to
Enter Input : become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What's the
Enter Input : point of it? What's the answer? It's clear enough: for herself, for her
Enter Input : comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone
Enter Input : else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will
Enter Input : sell herself! That's what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her
Enter Input : mother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,
Enter Input : 'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscience
Enter Input : even, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my
Enter Input : dear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn
Enter Input : to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can
Enter Input : persuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object. That's just
Enter Input : like us, it's as clear as daylight. It's clear that Rodion Romanovitch
Enter Input : Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,
Enter Input : yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him
Enter Input : a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may
Enter Input : even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his
Enter Input : life a famous man! But my mother? It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, her
Enter Input : first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,
Enter Input : loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even
Enter Input : from Sonia's fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long
Enter Input : as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both
Enter Input : of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in
Enter Input : it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with
Enter Input : Mr. Luzhin. 'There can be no question of love,' mother writes. And what
Enter Input : if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,
Enter Input : contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to 'keep up your
Enter Input : appearance,' too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness
Enter Input : means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same
Enter Input : thing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,
Enter Input : Dounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it's
Enter Input : simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be
Enter Input : paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it's more than you can
Enter Input : bear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the
Enter Input : curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,
Enter Input : she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,
Enter Input : indeed, what have you taken me for? I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia,
Enter Input : I won't have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it
Enter Input : shall not, it shall not! I won't accept it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You'll
Enter Input : forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your
Enter Input : side to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you
Enter Input : will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a
Enter Input : post_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all _words_, but
Enter Input : now? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And
Enter Input : what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their
Enter Input : hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How are
Enter Input : you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch
Enter Input : Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for
Enter Input : them? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind
Enter Input : with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a
Enter Input : shadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have
Enter Input : become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those
Enter Input : ten years? Can you fancy?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and
Enter Input : finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not
Enter Input : new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was
Enter Input : long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long
Enter Input : ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and
Enter Input : gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken
Enter Input : the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured
Enter Input : his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his
Enter Input : mother's letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear
Enter Input : that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved
Enter Input : questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it
Enter Input : quickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Or throw up life altogether!" he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--"accept
Enter Input : one's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in
Enter Input : oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have
Enter Input : absolutely nowhere to turn?" Marmeladov's question came suddenly into
Enter Input : his mind, "for every man must have somewhere to turn...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,
Enter Input : slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought
Enter Input : recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must
Enter Input : come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's
Enter Input : thought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the
Enter Input : thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,
Enter Input : it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly
Enter Input : became aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and
Enter Input : there was a darkness before his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted
Enter Input : to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----
Enter Input : Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He
Enter Input : walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little
Enter Input : adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had
Enter Input : noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first
Enter Input : he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his
Enter Input : path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the
Enter Input : road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But
Enter Input : there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front
Enter Input : of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first
Enter Input : reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more
Enter Input : intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so
Enter Input : strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl
Enter Input : quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with
Enter Input : no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had
Enter Input : on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not
Enter Input : properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the
Enter Input : waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was
Enter Input : flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was
Enter Input : walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She
Enter Input : drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the
Enter Input : seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;
Enter Input : she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,
Enter Input : apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once
Enter Input : that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He
Enter Input : could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the
Enter Input : face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than
Enter Input : fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking
Enter Input : and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was
Enter Input : doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and
Enter Input : showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,
Enter Input : and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much
Enter Input : frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite
Enter Input : deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen
Enter Input : paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,
Enter Input : too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object
Enter Input : of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had
Enter Input : followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at
Enter Input : him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding
Enter Input : his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His
Enter Input : intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set
Enter Input : man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and
Enter Input : moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult
Enter Input : this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked
Enter Input : towards the gentleman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?" he shouted, clenching
Enter Input : his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean?" the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty
Enter Input : astonishment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get away, that's what I mean."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How dare you, you low fellow!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without
Enter Input : reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like
Enter Input : himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a
Enter Input : police constable stood between them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What
Enter Input : do you want? Who are you?" he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his
Enter Input : rags.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,
Enter Input : soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are just the man I want," Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.
Enter Input : "I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too," he
Enter Input : added, addressing the gentleman, "come along, I have something to show
Enter Input : you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.
Enter Input : There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a
Enter Input : professional. It's more likely she has been given drink and deceived
Enter Input : somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they've put her
Enter Input : out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and
Enter Input : the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has
Enter Input : not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands;
Enter Input : that's evident. And now look there: I don't know that dandy with whom I
Enter Input : was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen
Enter Input : her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now
Enter Input : he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she
Enter Input : is in this state... that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw
Enter Input : him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he
Enter Input : is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and
Enter Input : is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we
Enter Input : keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to
Enter Input : understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to
Enter Input : examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, what a pity!" he said, shaking his head--"why, she is quite a
Enter Input : child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,"
Enter Input : he began addressing her, "where do you live?" The girl opened her weary
Enter Input : and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her
Enter Input : hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here," said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty
Enter Input : copecks, "here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The
Enter Input : only thing is to find out her address!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Missy, missy!" the policeman began again, taking the money. "I'll fetch
Enter Input : you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do
Enter Input : you live?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go away! They won't let me alone," the girl muttered, and once more
Enter Input : waved her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, ach, how shocking! It's shameful, missy, it's a shame!" He shook
Enter Input : his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a difficult job," the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he
Enter Input : did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have
Enter Input : seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you meet her far from here?" he asked him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in
Enter Input : the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have
Enter Input : mercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been
Enter Input : deceived, that's a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....
Enter Input : Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to
Enter Input : gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.
Enter Input : She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady," and he bent over her
Enter Input : once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, "looking like ladies and
Enter Input : refined" with pretensions to gentility and smartness....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The chief thing is," Raskolnikov persisted, "to keep her out of this
Enter Input : scoundrel's hands! Why should he outrage her! It's as clear as day what
Enter Input : he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,
Enter Input : and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and
Enter Input : confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another
Enter Input : ten paces away and again halted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Keep her out of his hands we can," said the constable thoughtfully,
Enter Input : "if only she'd tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,
Enter Input : missy!" he bent over her once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as
Enter Input : though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the
Enter Input : direction from which she had come. "Oh shameful wretches, they won't let
Enter Input : me alone!" she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though
Enter Input : staggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,
Enter Input : keeping his eye on her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her," the policeman said
Enter Input : resolutely, and he set off after them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!" he repeated aloud, sighing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a
Enter Input : complete revulsion of feeling came over him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hey, here!" he shouted after the policeman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The latter turned round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse
Enter Input : himself." He pointed at the dandy, "What is it to do with you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well!" ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he
Enter Input : walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a
Enter Input : madman or something even worse.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has carried off my twenty copecks," Raskolnikov murmured angrily
Enter Input : when he was left alone. "Well, let him take as much from the other
Enter Input : fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I
Enter Input : want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let
Enter Input : them devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give him
Enter Input : twenty copecks? Were they mine?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on
Enter Input : the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard
Enter Input : to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself
Enter Input : altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life
Enter Input : anew....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Poor girl!" he said, looking at the empty corner where she had
Enter Input : sat--"She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find
Enter Input : out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and
Enter Input : then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the
Enter Input : Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be
Enter Input : slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital
Enter Input : directly (that's always the luck of those girls with respectable
Enter Input : mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...
Enter Input : drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a
Enter Input : wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen
Enter Input : cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they've all
Enter Input : come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That's as it should
Enter Input : be, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year
Enter Input : go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain
Enter Input : chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words
Enter Input : they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you've said
Enter Input : 'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. If we had any other
Enter Input : word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one
Enter Input : of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But where am I going?" he thought suddenly. "Strange, I came out for
Enter Input : something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going
Enter Input : to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That's what it was... now I
Enter Input : remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin
Enter Input : into my head just now? That's curious."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the
Enter Input : university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at
Enter Input : the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did
Enter Input : not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave
Enter Input : him up. He took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements or
Enter Input : conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,
Enter Input : and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,
Enter Input : and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though
Enter Input : he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades
Enter Input : to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in
Enter Input : development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and
Enter Input : interests were beneath him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and
Enter Input : communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other
Enter Input : terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid
Enter Input : youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and
Enter Input : dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades
Enter Input : understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,
Enter Input : though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking
Enter Input : appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was
Enter Input : sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.
Enter Input : One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid
Enter Input : a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking
Enter Input : powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went
Enter Input : too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.
Enter Input : Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and
Enter Input : it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He
Enter Input : could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was
Enter Input : very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of
Enter Input : one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn
Enter Input : money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to
Enter Input : declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in
Enter Input : the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the
Enter Input : university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his
Enter Input : might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had
Enter Input : not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even
Enter Input : know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,
Enter Input : but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that
Enter Input : he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed
Enter Input : him by, as he did not want to annoy him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask for
Enter Input : work, to ask him to get me lessons or something..." Raskolnikov thought,
Enter Input : "but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose
Enter Input : he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that
Enter Input : I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...
Enter Input : hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I
Enter Input : earn? That's not what I want now. It's really absurd for me to go to
Enter Input : Razumihin...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
Enter Input : than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
Enter Input : significance in this apparently ordinary action.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by
Enter Input : means of Razumihin alone?" he asked himself in perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long
Enter Input : musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic
Enter Input : thought came into his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm... to Razumihin's," he said all at once, calmly, as though he had
Enter Input : reached a final determination. "I shall go to Razumihin's of course,
Enter Input : but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It
Enter Input : will be over and everything will begin afresh...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "After It," he shouted, jumping up from the seat, "but is It really
Enter Input : going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?" He left the
Enter Input : seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,
Enter Input : but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;
Enter Input : in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a
Enter Input : month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel
Enter Input : shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he
Enter Input : began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all
Enter Input : the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his
Enter Input : attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into
Enter Input : brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,
Enter Input : he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he
Enter Input : was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came
Enter Input : out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the
Enter Input : islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary
Enter Input : eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in
Enter Input : and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,
Enter Input : no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid
Enter Input : irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer
Enter Input : villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw
Enter Input : in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,
Enter Input : and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his
Enter Input : attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by
Enter Input : luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them
Enter Input : with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from
Enter Input : his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had
Enter Input : thirty copecks. "Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the
Enter Input : letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs
Enter Input : yesterday," he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he
Enter Input : soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
Enter Input : He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he
Enter Input : was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a
Enter Input : pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long
Enter Input : while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,
Enter Input : though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and
Enter Input : a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching
Enter Input : Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road
Enter Input : into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular
Enter Input : actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times
Enter Input : monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are
Enter Input : so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but
Enter Input : so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like
Enter Input : Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking
Enter Input : state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a
Enter Input : powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood
Enter Input : in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,
Enter Input : walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It
Enter Input : was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;
Enter Input : indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in
Enter Input : memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not
Enter Input : even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark
Enter Input : blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market
Enter Input : garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a
Enter Input : feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.
Enter Input : There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,
Enter Input : hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking
Enter Input : figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his
Enter Input : father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road
Enter Input : became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a
Enter Input : winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the
Enter Input : right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone
Enter Input : church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three
Enter Input : times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in
Enter Input : memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never
Enter Input : seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a
Enter Input : table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in
Enter Input : the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned
Enter Input : ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother's
Enter Input : grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger
Enter Input : brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,
Enter Input : but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited
Enter Input : the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and
Enter Input : to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was
Enter Input : walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he
Enter Input : was holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A
Enter Input : peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be
Enter Input : some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed
Enter Input : townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,
Enter Input : all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern
Enter Input : stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually
Enter Input : drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy
Enter Input : goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their
Enter Input : long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect
Enter Input : mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going
Enter Input : with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of
Enter Input : such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants'
Enter Input : nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load
Enter Input : of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in
Enter Input : a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even
Enter Input : about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that
Enter Input : he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the
Enter Input : window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing
Enter Input : and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken
Enter Input : peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over
Enter Input : their shoulders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get in, get in!" shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with
Enter Input : a fleshy face red as a carrot. "I'll take you all, get in!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the
Enter Input : crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Take us all with a beast like that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get in, I'll take you all," Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into
Enter Input : the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. "The bay
Enter Input : has gone with Matvey," he shouted from the cart--"and this brute, mates,
Enter Input : is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She's just
Enter Input : eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I'll make her gallop! She'll
Enter Input : gallop!" and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to
Enter Input : flog the little mare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get in! Come along!" The crowd laughed. "D'you hear, she'll gallop!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She'll jog along!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right! Give it to her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes. Six
Enter Input : men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,
Enter Input : rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded
Enter Input : headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.
Enter Input : The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help
Enter Input : laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a
Enter Input : gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to
Enter Input : help Mikolka. With the cry of "now," the mare tugged with all her might,
Enter Input : but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with
Enter Input : her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which
Enter Input : were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the
Enter Input : crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed
Enter Input : the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me get in, too, mates," shouted a young man in the crowd whose
Enter Input : appetite was aroused.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get in, all get in," cried Mikolka, "she will draw you all. I'll beat
Enter Input : her to death!" And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself
Enter Input : with fury.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Father, father," he cried, "father, what are they doing? Father, they
Enter Input : are beating the poor horse!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come along, come along!" said his father. "They are drunken and
Enter Input : foolish, they are in fun; come away, don't look!" and he tried to draw
Enter Input : him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself
Enter Input : with horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was
Enter Input : gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Beat her to death," cried Mikolka, "it's come to that. I'll do for
Enter Input : her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?" shouted an old man
Enter Input : in the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a
Enter Input : cartload," said another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'll kill her," shouted the third.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't meddle! It's my property, I'll do what I choose. Get in, more of
Enter Input : you! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,
Enter Input : roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man
Enter Input : could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that
Enter Input : trying to kick!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her
Enter Input : about the ribs. One ran each side.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes," cried Mikolka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give us a song, mates," shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the
Enter Input : cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The
Enter Input : woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : ... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped
Enter Input : across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his
Enter Input : tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across
Enter Input : the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he
Enter Input : rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was
Enter Input : shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and
Enter Input : would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to
Enter Input : the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll teach you to kick," Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down
Enter Input : the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,
Enter Input : thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort
Enter Input : brandished it over the mare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He'll crush her," was shouted round him. "He'll kill her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's my property," shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a
Enter Input : swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?" shouted voices in the
Enter Input : crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time
Enter Input : on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but
Enter Input : lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on
Enter Input : one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six
Enter Input : whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised
Enter Input : again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured
Enter Input : blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's a tough one," was shouted in the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She'll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her," said
Enter Input : an admiring spectator in the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off," shouted a third.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll show you! Stand off," Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down
Enter Input : the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. "Look
Enter Input : out," he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the
Enter Input : poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,
Enter Input : but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on
Enter Input : the ground like a log.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Finish her off," shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of
Enter Input : the cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything
Enter Input : they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying
Enter Input : mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the
Enter Input : crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You butchered her," someone shouted in the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why wouldn't she gallop then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My property!" shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar
Enter Input : in his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to
Enter Input : beat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No mistake about it, you are not a Christian," many voices were
Enter Input : shouting in the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the
Enter Input : crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and
Enter Input : kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and
Enter Input : flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant
Enter Input : his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried
Enter Input : him out of the crowd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come along, come! Let us go home," he said to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!" he sobbed, but his
Enter Input : voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They are drunk.... They are brutal... it's not our business!" said his
Enter Input : father. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He
Enter Input : tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and
Enter Input : stood up in terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank God, that was only a dream," he said, sitting down under a tree
Enter Input : and drawing deep breaths. "But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?
Enter Input : Such a hideous dream!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He
Enter Input : rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good God!" he cried, "can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an
Enter Input : axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I
Enter Input : shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;
Enter Input : hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it
Enter Input : be?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why am I going on like this?" he continued, sitting up again, as it
Enter Input : were in profound amazement. "I knew that I could never bring myself
Enter Input : to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,
Enter Input : yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I
Enter Input : realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going
Enter Input : over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs
Enter Input : yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the
Enter Input : very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Granted, granted that there is
Enter Input : no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last
Enter Input : month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn't
Enter Input : bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am
Enter Input : I still...?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at
Enter Input : finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,
Enter Input : his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly
Enter Input : to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that
Enter Input : had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense
Enter Input : of relief and peace in his soul. "Lord," he prayed, "show me my path--I
Enter Input : renounce that accursed... dream of mine."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the
Enter Input : glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he
Enter Input : was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been
Enter Input : forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,
Enter Input : freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during
Enter Input : those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously
Enter Input : impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very
Enter Input : exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined
Enter Input : turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to
Enter Input : himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been
Enter Input : more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,
Enter Input : he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was
Enter Input : obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It
Enter Input : is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without
Enter Input : noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking
Enter Input : himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time
Enter Input : such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he
Enter Input : had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his
Enter Input : life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances
Enter Input : in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive
Enter Input : influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for
Enter Input : him on purpose!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was about nine o'clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables
Enter Input : and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were
Enter Input : closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their
Enter Input : wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and
Enter Input : costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty
Enter Input : and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly
Enter Input : liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly
Enter Input : in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,
Enter Input : and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At
Enter Input : the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out
Enter Input : with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to
Enter Input : go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just
Enter Input : come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone
Enter Input : called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona
Enter Input : Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his
Enter Input : watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta
Enter Input : and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about
Enter Input : thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was
Enter Input : a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who
Enter Input : made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with
Enter Input : a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and
Enter Input : doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The
Enter Input : moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange
Enter Input : sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing
Enter Input : astonishing about this meeting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna," the
Enter Input : huckster was saying aloud. "Come round to-morrow about seven. They will
Enter Input : be here too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To-morrow?" said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to
Enter Input : make up her mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna," gabbled
Enter Input : the huckster's wife, a lively little woman. "I look at you, you are like
Enter Input : some little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a
Enter Input : step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna," her husband
Enter Input : interrupted; "that's my advice, but come round to us without asking.
Enter Input : It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a
Enter Input : notion."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Am I to come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "About seven o'clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able
Enter Input : to decide for yourself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And we'll have a cup of tea," added his wife.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right, I'll come," said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began
Enter Input : slowly moving away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,
Enter Input : unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed
Enter Input : by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had
Enter Input : learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at
Enter Input : seven o'clock Lizaveta, the old woman's sister and only companion, would
Enter Input : be away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old
Enter Input : woman _would be left alone_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man
Enter Input : condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;
Enter Input : but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom
Enter Input : of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably
Enter Input : decided.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he
Enter Input : could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan
Enter Input : than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have
Enter Input : been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with
Enter Input : greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and
Enter Input : investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose
Enter Input : life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his
Enter Input : wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was
Enter Input : nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been
Enter Input : reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all
Enter Input : women's things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,
Enter Input : they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta's business. She
Enter Input : undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest
Enter Input : and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule
Enter Input : little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of
Enter Input : superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.
Enter Input : And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something
Enter Input : strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar
Enter Input : influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew
Enter Input : called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to
Enter Input : give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he
Enter Input : might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for
Enter Input : he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had
Enter Input : remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his
Enter Input : father's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,
Enter Input : a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When
Enter Input : he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her
Enter Input : at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got
Enter Input : two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way
Enter Input : home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange
Enter Input : idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very
Enter Input : much absorbed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he
Enter Input : did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had
Enter Input : played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard
Enter Input : the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and
Enter Input : give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he
Enter Input : had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course
Enter Input : it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary
Enter Input : impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;
Enter Input : the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona
Enter Input : Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She is first-rate," he said. "You can always get money from her. She is
Enter Input : as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and
Enter Input : she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have
Enter Input : had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you
Enter Input : were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she
Enter Input : gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven
Enter Input : percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying
Enter Input : that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was
Enter Input : continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,
Enter Input : though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's a phenomenon for you," cried the student and he laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a
Enter Input : peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened
Enter Input : with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending
Enter Input : for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about
Enter Input : her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,
Enter Input : being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked
Enter Input : day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the
Enter Input : washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister
Enter Input : all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind
Enter Input : without her sister's permission. The old woman had already made her
Enter Input : will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a
Enter Input : farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was
Enter Input : left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be
Enter Input : said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,
Enter Input : unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long
Enter Input : feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered
Enter Input : goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed
Enter Input : most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was
Enter Input : continually with child.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you say she is hideous?" observed the officer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but
Enter Input : you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face
Enter Input : and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are
Enter Input : attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up
Enter Input : with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is
Enter Input : really very sweet."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem to find her attractive yourself," laughed the officer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From her queerness. No, I'll tell you what. I could kill that damned
Enter Input : old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the
Enter Input : faintest conscience-prick," the student added with warmth. The officer
Enter Input : laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, I want to ask you a serious question," the student said hotly.
Enter Input : "I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,
Enter Input : senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply
Enter Input : useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is
Enter Input : living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You
Enter Input : understand? You understand?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, I understand," answered the officer, watching his excited
Enter Input : companion attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for
Enter Input : want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good
Enter Input : deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman's money which will be
Enter Input : buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the
Enter Input : right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from
Enter Input : vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take
Enter Input : her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of
Enter Input : humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny
Enter Input : crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands
Enter Input : would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives
Enter Input : in exchange--it's simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of
Enter Input : that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
Enter Input : No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact
Enter Input : because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of
Enter Input : others; the other day she bit Lizaveta's finger out of spite; it almost
Enter Input : had to be amputated."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course she does not deserve to live," remarked the officer, "but
Enter Input : there it is, it's nature."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but
Enter Input : for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,
Enter Input : there would never have been a single great man. They talk of
Enter Input : duty, conscience--I don't want to say anything against duty and
Enter Input : conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have
Enter Input : another question to ask you. Listen!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, you stay, I'll ask you a question. Listen!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the
Enter Input : old woman _yourself_?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It's nothing to
Enter Input : do with me...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there's no justice about
Enter Input : it.... Let us have another game."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary
Enter Input : youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in
Enter Input : different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear
Enter Input : such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain
Enter Input : was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the
Enter Input : moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old
Enter Input : woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This
Enter Input : coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern
Enter Input : had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had
Enter Input : really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : *****
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
Enter Input : for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no
Enter Input : candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never
Enter Input : recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At
Enter Input : last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised
Enter Input : with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep
Enter Input : came over him, as it were crushing him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,
Enter Input : coming into his room at ten o'clock the next morning, had difficulty
Enter Input : in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the
Enter Input : second brew and again in her own tea-pot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My goodness, how he sleeps!" she cried indignantly. "And he is always
Enter Input : asleep."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in
Enter Input : his garret and sank back on the sofa again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Going to sleep again," cried Nastasya. "Are you ill, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He made no reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you want some tea?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Afterwards," he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning
Enter Input : to the wall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya stood over him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps he really is ill," she said, turned and went out. She came in
Enter Input : again at two o'clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood
Enter Input : untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully
Enter Input : rousing him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why are you lying like a log?" she shouted, looking at him with
Enter Input : repulsion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you ill or not?" asked Nastasya and again received no answer.
Enter Input : "You'd better go out and get a breath of air," she said after a pause.
Enter Input : "Will you eat it or not?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Afterwards," he said weakly. "You can go."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he motioned her out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went
Enter Input : out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while
Enter Input : at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and
Enter Input : began to eat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were
Enter Input : mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself
Enter Input : on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,
Enter Input : with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such
Enter Input : strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was
Enter Input : in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,
Enter Input : the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a
Enter Input : complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water
Enter Input : from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was
Enter Input : wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured
Enter Input : stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like
Enter Input : gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,
Enter Input : raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,
Enter Input : suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the
Enter Input : sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began
Enter Input : listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet
Enter Input : on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and
Enter Input : monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the
Enter Input : previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And
Enter Input : meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction
Enter Input : were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted
Enter Input : haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his
Enter Input : energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart
Enter Input : kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had
Enter Input : to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He
Enter Input : rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away
Enter Input : under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long
Enter Input : strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded
Enter Input : this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some
Enter Input : stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two
Enter Input : ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook
Enter Input : as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside
Enter Input : when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready
Enter Input : long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the
Enter Input : noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended
Enter Input : for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the
Enter Input : street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have
Enter Input : had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now
Enter Input : he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang
Enter Input : quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat
Enter Input : pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did
Enter Input : not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it
Enter Input : could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the
Enter Input : hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a
Enter Input : fortnight before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening
Enter Input : between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out
Enter Input : the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This
Enter Input : pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and
Enter Input : thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood
Enter Input : in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of
Enter Input : a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece
Enter Input : of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.
Enter Input : Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,
Enter Input : he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round
Enter Input : them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and
Enter Input : tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This
Enter Input : was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while
Enter Input : she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip
Enter Input : was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first
Enter Input : minute that the "thing" was made of wood. All this had been stored by
Enter Input : him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when
Enter Input : he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It struck six long ago."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Long ago! My God!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend
Enter Input : his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the
Enter Input : most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the
Enter Input : deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a
Enter Input : pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less
Enter Input : on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in
Enter Input : passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by
Enter Input : him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final
Enter Input : they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in
Enter Input : his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for
Enter Input : a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his
Enter Input : plans.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point
Enter Input : could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of
Enter Input : any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all
Enter Input : as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of
Enter Input : unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,
Enter Input : that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.
Enter Input : Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;
Enter Input : she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the
Enter Input : door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her
Enter Input : about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into
Enter Input : the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything
Enter Input : was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.
Enter Input : Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had
Enter Input : come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait
Enter Input : till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss
Enter Input : the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at
Enter Input : least grounds for suspicion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and
Enter Input : indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off
Enter Input : trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed
Enter Input : utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not
Enter Input : imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get
Enter Input : up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with
Enter Input : the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at
Enter Input : an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say
Enter Input : "come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!"--and at once he
Enter Input : had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.
Enter Input : Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his
Enter Input : analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he
Enter Input : could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort
Enter Input : he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought
Enter Input : arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were
Enter Input : forcing and drawing him to it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one
Enter Input : question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily
Enter Input : detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He
Enter Input : had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his
Enter Input : opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility
Enter Input : of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every
Enter Input : criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a
Enter Input : childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence
Enter Input : and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse
Enter Input : of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,
Enter Input : developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the
Enter Input : perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment
Enter Input : of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the
Enter Input : individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The
Enter Input : question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the
Enter Input : crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of
Enter Input : the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there
Enter Input : could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would
Enter Input : remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the
Enter Input : simple reason that his design was "not a crime...." We will omit all the
Enter Input : process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have
Enter Input : run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely
Enter Input : material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his
Enter Input : mind. "One has but to keep all one's will-power and reason to deal
Enter Input : with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has
Enter Input : familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business...." But
Enter Input : this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he
Enter Input : came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite
Enter Input : differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even
Enter Input : left the staircase. When he reached the landlady's kitchen, the door
Enter Input : of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in
Enter Input : Nastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether
Enter Input : the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when
Enter Input : he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly
Enter Input : saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied
Enter Input : there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing
Enter Input : him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him
Enter Input : all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as
Enter Input : though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not
Enter Input : the axe! He was overwhelmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What made me think," he reflected, as he went under the gateway, "what
Enter Input : made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
Enter Input : Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in
Enter Input : his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk
Enter Input : for appearance' sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more
Enter Input : revolting. "And what a chance I have lost for ever!" he muttered,
Enter Input : standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter's little
Enter Input : dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter's
Enter Input : room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the
Enter Input : right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the
Enter Input : room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called
Enter Input : the porter. "Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for
Enter Input : the door is wide open." He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled
Enter Input : it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;
Enter Input : at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both
Enter Input : hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!
Enter Input : "When reason fails, the devil helps!" he thought with a strange grin.
Enter Input : This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening
Enter Input : suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking
Enter Input : at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.
Enter Input : Suddenly he thought of his hat. "Good heavens! I had the money the day
Enter Input : before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!" A curse rose
Enter Input : from the bottom of his soul.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on
Enter Input : the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at
Enter Input : the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the
Enter Input : other side....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes
Enter Input : thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much
Enter Input : afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied
Enter Input : by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov
Enter Input : garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great
Enter Input : fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all
Enter Input : the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer
Enter Input : garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the
Enter Input : garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a
Enter Input : great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why
Enter Input : in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some
Enter Input : peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there
Enter Input : are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all
Enter Input : sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back
Enter Input : to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. "What nonsense!"
Enter Input : he thought, "better think of nothing at all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that
Enter Input : meets them on the way," flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,
Enter Input : like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now
Enter Input : he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock
Enter Input : somewhere struck once. "What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it
Enter Input : must be fast!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very
Enter Input : moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had
Enter Input : just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under
Enter Input : the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into
Enter Input : the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other
Enter Input : side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one
Enter Input : noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge
Enter Input : quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his
Enter Input : head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old
Enter Input : woman's room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was
Enter Input : already on the stairs....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and
Enter Input : once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly
Enter Input : and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the
Enter Input : stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no
Enter Input : one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were
Enter Input : at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought
Enter Input : a minute and went on. "Of course it would be better if they had not been
Enter Input : here, but... it's two storeys above them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the
Enter Input : flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman's was
Enter Input : apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been
Enter Input : torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant
Enter Input : the thought floated through his mind "Shall I go back?" But he made no
Enter Input : answer and began listening at the old woman's door, a dead silence. Then
Enter Input : he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...
Enter Input : then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew
Enter Input : himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. "Am I very pale?"
Enter Input : he wondered. "Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I
Enter Input : better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite
Enter Input : him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,
Enter Input : he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he
Enter Input : rang again, more loudly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman
Enter Input : was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some
Enter Input : knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.
Enter Input : Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to
Enter Input : suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly
Enter Input : heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the
Enter Input : rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily
Enter Input : close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly
Enter Input : listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved
Enter Input : a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have
Enter Input : the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,
Enter Input : and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out
Enter Input : in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he
Enter Input : had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and
Enter Input : he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the
Enter Input : latch unfastened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VII
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and
Enter Input : suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost
Enter Input : his head and nearly made a great mistake.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not
Enter Input : hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took
Enter Input : hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from
Enter Input : attempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,
Enter Input : but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with
Enter Input : it on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not
Enter Input : allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back
Enter Input : in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared
Enter Input : with open eyes at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna," he began, trying to speak easily, but
Enter Input : his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. "I have come... I have
Enter Input : brought something... but we'd better come in... to the light...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old
Enter Input : woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you
Enter Input : the pledge I promised the other day..." And he held out the pledge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in
Enter Input : the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and
Enter Input : mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer
Enter Input : in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that
Enter Input : he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened
Enter Input : that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half
Enter Input : minute, he thought he would have run away from her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?" he said suddenly,
Enter Input : also with malice. "Take it if you like, if not I'll go elsewhere, I am
Enter Input : in a hurry."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of
Enter Input : itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor's resolute tone
Enter Input : evidently restored her confidence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?" she asked,
Enter Input : looking at the pledge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She held out her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
Enter Input : Have you been bathing, or what?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fever," he answered abruptly. "You can't help getting pale... if you've
Enter Input : nothing to eat," he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the
Enter Input : truth; the old woman took the pledge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and
Enter Input : weighing the pledge in her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all
Enter Input : her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left
Enter Input : him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He
Enter Input : unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet
Enter Input : take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the
Enter Input : coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing
Enter Input : more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and
Enter Input : fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what has he tied it up like this for?" the old woman cried with
Enter Input : vexation and moved towards him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung
Enter Input : it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without
Enter Input : effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He
Enter Input : seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once
Enter Input : brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked
Enter Input : with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and
Enter Input : fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.
Enter Input : As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She
Enter Input : cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the
Enter Input : floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held "the
Enter Input : pledge." Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side
Enter Input : and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the
Enter Input : body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her
Enter Input : face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,
Enter Input : the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her
Enter Input : pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket
Enter Input : from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full
Enter Input : possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his
Enter Input : hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been
Enter Input : particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get
Enter Input : smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,
Enter Input : as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom
Enter Input : with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
Enter Input : Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with
Enter Input : a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of
Enter Input : drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the
Enter Input : chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed
Enter Input : over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go
Enter Input : away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
Enter Input : He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea
Enter Input : occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be
Enter Input : still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,
Enter Input : he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more
Enter Input : over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that
Enter Input : she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw
Enter Input : clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He
Enter Input : was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed
Enter Input : it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of
Enter Input : blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but
Enter Input : the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked
Enter Input : with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but
Enter Input : something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised
Enter Input : the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not
Enter Input : dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,
Enter Input : after two minutes' hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off
Enter Input : without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a
Enter Input : purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of
Enter Input : copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy
Enter Input : chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed
Enter Input : very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,
Enter Input : flung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed back into the
Enter Input : bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them
Enter Input : again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It
Enter Input : was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making
Enter Input : mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one
Enter Input : and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered
Enter Input : and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging
Enter Input : there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of
Enter Input : drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,
Enter Input : and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest
Enter Input : of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old
Enter Input : women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a
Enter Input : good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched
Enter Input : lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched
Enter Input : key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was
Enter Input : a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,
Enter Input : then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but
Enter Input : clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on
Enter Input : the red brocade. "It's red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,"
Enter Input : the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.
Enter Input : "Good God, am I going out of my senses?" he thought with terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from
Enter Input : under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned
Enter Input : out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably
Enter Input : all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,
Enter Input : ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply
Enter Input : wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with
Enter Input : tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers
Enter Input : and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he
Enter Input : had not time to take many....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped
Enter Input : short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been
Enter Input : his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though
Enter Input : someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for
Enter Input : a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited
Enter Input : holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of
Enter Input : the bedroom.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
Enter Input : She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet
Enter Input : and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out
Enter Input : of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a
Enter Input : shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but
Enter Input : still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the
Enter Input : corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no
Enter Input : sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her
Enter Input : with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies' mouths,
Enter Input : when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them
Enter Input : and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so
Enter Input : simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not
Enter Input : even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary
Enter Input : and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.
Enter Input : She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding
Enter Input : it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the
Enter Input : sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the
Enter Input : head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,
Enter Input : snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this
Enter Input : second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place
Enter Input : as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing
Enter Input : and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the
Enter Input : difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the
Enter Input : absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,
Enter Input : perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of
Enter Input : that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would
Enter Input : have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and
Enter Input : not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had
Enter Input : done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew
Enter Input : stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even
Enter Input : into the room for anything in the world.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take
Enter Input : possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what
Enter Input : was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the
Enter Input : kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought
Enter Input : him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.
Enter Input : He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap
Enter Input : that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands
Enter Input : in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the
Enter Input : blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where
Enter Input : there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all
Enter Input : with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and
Enter Input : then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.
Enter Input : There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He
Enter Input : carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was
Enter Input : possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,
Enter Input : his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be
Enter Input : nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
Enter Input : But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something
Enter Input : quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the
Enter Input : room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea
Enter Input : that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,
Enter Input : of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something
Enter Input : utterly different from what he was now doing. "Good God!" he muttered "I
Enter Input : must fly, fly," and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror
Enter Input : awaited him such as he had never known before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer
Enter Input : door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,
Enter Input : was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,
Enter Input : all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him
Enter Input : perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta
Enter Input : afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that
Enter Input : she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the
Enter Input : staircase.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,
Enter Input : two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.
Enter Input : "What are they about?" He waited patiently. At last all was still, as
Enter Input : though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,
Enter Input : but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone
Enter Input : began going downstairs humming a tune. "How is it they all make such
Enter Input : a noise?" flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and
Enter Input : waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a
Enter Input : step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but
Enter Input : he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he
Enter Input : began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,
Enter Input : to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow
Enter Input : peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now
Enter Input : _he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was
Enter Input : growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And
Enter Input : now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to
Enter Input : him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream
Enter Input : in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is
Enter Input : rooted to the spot and cannot even move one's arms.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly
Enter Input : started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the
Enter Input : flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,
Enter Input : noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had
Enter Input : done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown
Enter Input : visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one
Enter Input : another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when
Enter Input : the door divided them and he was listening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The visitor panted several times. "He must be a big, fat man," thought
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream
Enter Input : indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of
Enter Input : something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite
Enter Input : seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently
Enter Input : and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror
Enter Input : at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every
Enter Input : minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem
Enter Input : possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the
Enter Input : fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him
Enter Input : again. "I shall fall down!" flashed through his mind, but the unknown
Enter Input : began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!" he bawled in a
Enter Input : thick voice, "Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,
Enter Input : my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at
Enter Input : the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate
Enter Input : acquaintance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the
Enter Input : stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at
Enter Input : first.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't say there's no one at home," the new-comer cried in a
Enter Input : cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on
Enter Input : pulling the bell. "Good evening, Koch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From his voice he must be quite young," thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who the devil can tell? I've almost broken the lock," answered Koch.
Enter Input : "But how do you come to know me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at
Enter Input : billiards at Gambrinus'."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So they are not at home? That's queer. It's awfully stupid though.
Enter Input : Where could the old woman have gone? I've come on business."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes; and I have business with her, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to
Enter Input : get some money!" cried the young man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The
Enter Input : old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It's out of my way.
Enter Input : And where the devil she can have got to, I can't make out. She sits here
Enter Input : from year's end to year's end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet
Enter Input : here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hadn't we better ask the porter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where she's gone and when she'll be back."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go
Enter Input : anywhere."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he once more tugged at the door-handle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Damn it all. There's nothing to be done, we must go!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay!" cried the young man suddenly. "Do you see how the door shakes if
Enter Input : you pull it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how
Enter Input : the hook clanks?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, don't you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they
Enter Input : were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the
Enter Input : key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook
Enter Input : is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,
Enter Input : don't you see. So there they are sitting inside and don't open the
Enter Input : door!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well! And so they must be!" cried Koch, astonished. "What are they
Enter Input : about in there?" And he began furiously shaking the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay!" cried the young man again. "Don't pull at it! There must be
Enter Input : something wrong.... Here, you've been ringing and pulling at the door
Enter Input : and still they don't open! So either they've both fainted or..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I tell you what. Let's go fetch the porter, let him wake them up."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both were going down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you'd better."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm studying the law you see! It's evident, e-vi-dent there's something
Enter Input : wrong here!" the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one
Enter Input : tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began
Enter Input : touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once
Enter Input : more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he
Enter Input : bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock
Enter Input : on the inside and so nothing could be seen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of
Enter Input : delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
Enter Input : While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times
Enter Input : occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the
Enter Input : door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,
Enter Input : while they could not open the door! "Only make haste!" was the thought
Enter Input : that flashed through his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what the devil is he about?..." Time was passing, one minute, and
Enter Input : another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What the devil?" he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his
Enter Input : sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy
Enter Input : boots on the stairs. The steps died away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! What am I to do?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.
Enter Input : Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as
Enter Input : thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice
Enter Input : below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going
Enter Input : back to the flat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hey there! Catch the brute!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran
Enter Input : down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was
Enter Input : still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began
Enter Input : noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He
Enter Input : distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. "Hey!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling "come what
Enter Input : must!" If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was
Enter Input : lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only
Enter Input : a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the
Enter Input : right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the
Enter Input : second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though
Enter Input : for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just
Enter Input : run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle
Enter Input : of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one
Enter Input : instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall
Enter Input : and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
Enter Input : Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He
Enter Input : waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through
Enter Input : the gateway and turned to the left in the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the
Enter Input : flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as
Enter Input : the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the
Enter Input : bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and
Enter Input : completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had
Enter Input : succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would
Enter Input : guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were
Enter Input : going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though
Enter Input : the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. "Should he
Enter Input : slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,
Enter Input : hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,
Enter Input : hopeless!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.
Enter Input : Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky
Enter Input : because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a
Enter Input : grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could
Enter Input : scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.
Enter Input : "My word, he has been going it!" someone shouted at him when he came out
Enter Input : on the canal bank.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the
Enter Input : worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal
Enter Input : bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more
Enter Input : conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost
Enter Input : falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from
Enter Input : quite a different direction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his
Enter Input : house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
Enter Input : And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to
Enter Input : escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course
Enter Input : incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to
Enter Input : restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's yard. But
Enter Input : it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter's room was closed
Enter Input : but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at
Enter Input : home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he
Enter Input : walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,
Enter Input : "What do you want?" he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But
Enter Input : again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe
Enter Input : back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as
Enter Input : before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;
Enter Input : the landlady's door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself
Enter Input : on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank
Enter Input : forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have
Enter Input : jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were
Enter Input : simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could
Enter Input : not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....

Enter Input : PART II

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at
Enter Input : such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not
Enter Input : occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get
Enter Input : light. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.
Enter Input : Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he
Enter Input : heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o'clock. They woke
Enter Input : him up now.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it's
Enter Input : past two o'clock," and at once he leaped up, as though someone had
Enter Input : pulled him from the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! Past two o'clock!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at
Enter Input : once, in one flash, he recollected everything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came
Enter Input : over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in
Enter Input : his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his
Enter Input : teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and
Enter Input : began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he
Enter Input : gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he
Enter Input : could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have
Enter Input : flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his
Enter Input : hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I'm drunk
Enter Input : but..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly
Enter Input : looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there
Enter Input : no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he
Enter Input : began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything
Enter Input : over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through
Enter Input : his search three times.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where
Enter Input : some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge
Enter Input : of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed
Enter Input : threads. There seemed to be nothing more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of
Enter Input : the old woman's box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till
Enter Input : then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them
Enter Input : while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed
Enter Input : to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out
Enter Input : everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was
Enter Input : nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had
Enter Input : come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began
Enter Input : stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: "They're in! All
Enter Input : out of sight, and the purse too!" he thought gleefully, getting up and
Enter Input : gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly
Enter Input : he shuddered all over with horror; "My God!" he whispered in despair:
Enter Input : "what's the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide
Enter Input : things?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of
Enter Input : money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But now, now, what am I glad of?" he thought, "Is that hiding things?
Enter Input : My reason's deserting me--simply!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another
Enter Input : unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside
Enter Input : him his old student's winter coat, which was still warm though almost in
Enter Input : rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and
Enter Input : delirium. He lost consciousness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,
Enter Input : and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not
Enter Input : taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!
Enter Input : Such a piece of evidence!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits
Enter Input : among his linen under the pillow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pieces of torn linen couldn't rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I
Enter Input : think not, I think not, any way!" he repeated, standing in the middle
Enter Input : of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about
Enter Input : him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not
Enter Input : forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,
Enter Input : and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an
Enter Input : insufferable torture.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Surely it isn't beginning already! Surely it isn't my punishment coming
Enter Input : upon me? It is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the
Enter Input : floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is the matter with me!" he cried again, like one distraught.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes
Enter Input : were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many
Enter Input : stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because
Enter Input : his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was
Enter Input : clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the
Enter Input : purse too. "Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put
Enter Input : the wet purse in my pocket!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were
Enter Input : traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and
Enter Input : memory, since I guessed it of myself," he thought triumphantly, with
Enter Input : a deep sigh of relief; "it's simply the weakness of fever, a moment's
Enter Input : delirium," and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his
Enter Input : trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the
Enter Input : sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He
Enter Input : flung off his boots; "traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with
Enter Input : blood;" he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... "But what am I
Enter Input : to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the
Enter Input : room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?
Enter Input : But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better
Enter Input : go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away," he
Enter Input : repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, "and at once, this minute,
Enter Input : without lingering..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy
Enter Input : shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to
Enter Input : "go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that
Enter Input : it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!" Several times
Enter Input : he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!" shouted
Enter Input : Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. "For whole days together
Enter Input : he's snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It's
Enter Input : past ten."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Maybe he's not at home," said a man's voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ha! that's the porter's voice.... What does he want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a
Enter Input : positive pain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then who can have latched the door?" retorted Nastasya. "He's taken to
Enter Input : bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake
Enter Input : up!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do they want? Why the porter? All's discovered. Resist or open?
Enter Input : Come what may!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the
Enter Input : bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and
Enter Input : desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded
Enter Input : paper sealed with bottle-wax.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A notice from the office," he announced, as he gave him the paper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From what office?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To the police?... What for?..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How can I tell? You're sent for, so you go."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to
Enter Input : go away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's downright ill!" observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.
Enter Input : The porter turned his head for a moment. "He's been in a fever since
Enter Input : yesterday," she added.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without
Enter Input : opening it. "Don't you get up then," Nastasya went on compassionately,
Enter Input : seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. "You're ill, and
Enter Input : so don't go; there's no such hurry. What have you got there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his
Enter Input : trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep
Enter Input : with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that
Enter Input : half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand
Enter Input : and so fallen asleep again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Look at the rags he's collected and sleeps with them, as though he has
Enter Input : got hold of a treasure..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his
Enter Input : eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational
Enter Input : reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that
Enter Input : with a person who was going to be arrested. "But... the police?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'd better have some tea! Yes? I'll bring it, there's some left."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No... I'm going; I'll go at once," he muttered, getting on to his feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you'll never get downstairs!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I'll go."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you please."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She followed the porter out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,
Enter Input : and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could
Enter Input : distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,
Enter Input : thank God!" Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began
Enter Input : reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an
Enter Input : ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at
Enter Input : half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with
Enter Input : the police! And why just to-day?" he thought in agonising bewilderment.
Enter Input : "Good God, only get it over soon!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into
Enter Input : laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He began, hurriedly dressing. "If I'm lost, I am lost, I don't care!
Enter Input : Shall I put the sock on?" he suddenly wondered, "it will get dustier
Enter Input : still and the traces will be gone."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing
Enter Input : and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,
Enter Input : he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all conventional, that's all relative, merely a way of looking
Enter Input : at it," he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his
Enter Input : mind, while he was shuddering all over, "there, I've got it on! I have
Enter Input : finished by getting it on!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it's too much for me..." he thought. His legs shook. "From fear,"
Enter Input : he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. "It's a trick! They
Enter Input : want to decoy me there and confound me over everything," he mused, as
Enter Input : he went out on to the stairs--"the worst of it is I'm almost
Enter Input : light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as
Enter Input : they were in the hole in the wall, "and very likely, it's on purpose
Enter Input : to search when I'm out," he thought, and stopped short. But he was
Enter Input : possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call
Enter Input : it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. "Only to get it over!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had
Enter Input : fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench
Enter Input : from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish
Enter Input : pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,
Enter Input : so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going
Enter Input : round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the
Enter Input : street on a bright sunny day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of
Enter Input : trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted
Enter Input : his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell," he thought, as he drew
Enter Input : near the police-station.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been
Enter Input : moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once
Enter Input : for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,
Enter Input : he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with
Enter Input : a book in his hand. "A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is
Enter Input : here," and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want
Enter Input : to ask questions of anyone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything..." he thought, as
Enter Input : he reached the fourth floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The
Enter Input : kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost
Enter Input : the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase
Enter Input : was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their
Enter Input : arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of
Enter Input : the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,
Enter Input : too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh
Enter Input : paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.
Enter Input : All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him
Enter Input : on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some
Enter Input : clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a
Enter Input : queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He showed the notice he had received.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a student?" the man asked, glancing at the notice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, formerly a student."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a
Enter Input : particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no
Enter Input : interest in anything," thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go in there to the head clerk," said the clerk, pointing towards the
Enter Input : furthest room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and
Enter Input : packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
Enter Input : Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the
Enter Input : table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.
Enter Input : The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,
Enter Input : excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a
Enter Input : saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced
Enter Input : at it, said: "Wait a minute," and went on attending to the lady in
Enter Input : mourning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He breathed more freely. "It can't be that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have
Enter Input : courage and be calm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!
Enter Input : Hm... it's a pity there's no air here," he added, "it's stifling.... It
Enter Input : makes one's head dizzier than ever... and one's mind too..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing
Enter Input : his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,
Enter Input : something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet
Enter Input : the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him
Enter Input : and guess something from his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile
Enter Input : face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and
Enter Input : foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,
Enter Input : and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain
Enter Input : on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who
Enter Input : was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down," he said casually to the
Enter Input : gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not
Enter Input : venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ich danke," said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank
Enter Input : into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated
Enter Input : about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She
Enter Input : smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half
Enter Input : the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was
Enter Input : impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with
Enter Input : some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of
Enter Input : his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and
Enter Input : sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her
Enter Input : seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the
Enter Input : officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to
Enter Input : sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He
Enter Input : had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his
Enter Input : face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except
Enter Input : a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at
Enter Input : Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his
Enter Input : humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his
Enter Input : clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on
Enter Input : him, so that he felt positively affronted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want?" he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged
Enter Input : fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was summoned... by a notice..." Raskolnikov faltered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "For the recovery of money due, from _the student_," the head clerk
Enter Input : interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. "Here!" and he
Enter Input : flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. "Read that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Money? What money?" thought Raskolnikov, "but... then... it's certainly
Enter Input : not _that_."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A
Enter Input : load was lifted from his back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?" shouted the
Enter Input : assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more
Enter Input : aggrieved. "You are told to come at nine, and now it's twelve!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikov
Enter Input : answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew
Enter Input : suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. "And it's enough that
Enter Input : I have come here ill with fever."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Kindly refrain from shouting!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm not shouting, I'm speaking very quietly, it's you who are shouting
Enter Input : at me. I'm a student, and allow no one to shout at me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he
Enter Input : could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Be silent! You are in a government office. Don't be impudent, sir!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're in a government office, too," cried Raskolnikov, "and you're
Enter Input : smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect
Enter Input : to all of us."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant
Enter Input : superintendent was obviously disconcerted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's not your business!" he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.
Enter Input : "Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr
Enter Input : Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don't pay your
Enter Input : debts! You're a fine bird!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the
Enter Input : paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second
Enter Input : time, and still did not understand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is this?" he asked the head clerk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must
Enter Input : either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written
Enter Input : declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not
Enter Input : to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your
Enter Input : property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed
Enter Input : against you according to the law."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I... am not in debt to anyone!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen
Enter Input : roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us
Enter Input : for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine
Enter Input : months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.
Enter Input : We therefore summon you, hereupon."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But she is my landlady!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if she is your landlady?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,
Enter Input : and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire
Enter Input : for the first time--as though he would say: "Well, how do you feel now?"
Enter Input : But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that
Enter Input : worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he
Enter Input : read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but
Enter Input : all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from
Enter Input : overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment
Enter Input : without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions
Enter Input : or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant
Enter Input : of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment
Enter Input : something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant
Enter Input : superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov's disrespect, still fuming
Enter Input : and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the
Enter Input : unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in
Enter Input : with an exceedingly silly smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You shameful hussy!" he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The
Enter Input : lady in mourning had left the office.) "What was going on at your house
Enter Input : last night? Eh! A disgrace again, you're a scandal to the whole street.
Enter Input : Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,
Enter Input : I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the
Enter Input : eleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The paper fell out of Raskolnikov's hands, and he looked wildly at the
Enter Input : smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it
Enter Input : meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He
Enter Input : listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his
Enter Input : nerves were on edge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped
Enter Input : short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not
Enter Input : be stopped except by force.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the
Enter Input : storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of
Enter Input : abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the
Enter Input : smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and
Enter Input : curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her
Enter Input : word: and at last she found it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain," she
Enter Input : pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,
Enter Input : though with a strong German accent, "and no sort of scandal, and his
Enter Input : honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,
Enter Input : and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
Enter Input : and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any
Enter Input : scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles
Enter Input : again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte
Enter Input : with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and
Enter Input : he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said
Enter Input : so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then
Enter Input : I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the
Enter Input : eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the
Enter Input : cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
Enter Input : and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in
Enter Input : the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of
Enter Input : squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!
Enter Input : And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,
Enter Input : Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_
Enter Input : pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five
Enter Input : roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused
Enter Input : all the scandal. 'I will show you up,' he said, 'for I can write to all
Enter Input : the papers about you.'"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then he was an author?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable
Enter Input : house...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now then! Enough! I have told you already..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk repeated significantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his
Enter Input : head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it
Enter Input : you for the last time," the assistant went on. "If there is a scandal
Enter Input : in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the
Enter Input : lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary
Enter Input : man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an 'honourable
Enter Input : house'? A nice set, these authors!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. "There was a scandal
Enter Input : the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and
Enter Input : would not pay; 'I'll write a satire on you,' says he. And there was
Enter Input : another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful
Enter Input : language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and
Enter Input : daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner's shop
Enter Input : the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,
Enter Input : town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one
Enter Input : day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all
Enter Input : directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she
Enter Input : stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open
Enter Input : face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of
Enter Input : the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste
Enter Input : to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she
Enter Input : fluttered out of the office.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!" said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya
Enter Input : Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. "You are aroused again, you are
Enter Input : fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what then!" Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;
Enter Input : and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of
Enter Input : his shoulders at each step. "Here, if you will kindly look: an author,
Enter Input : or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given
Enter Input : an I O U, won't clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly
Enter Input : being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest
Enter Input : against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and
Enter Input : just look at him, please. Here's the gentleman, and very attractive he
Enter Input : is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,
Enter Input : you can't bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and
Enter Input : went too far yourself," continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. "But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure
Enter Input : you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no
Enter Input : stopping him! And then it's all over! And at the bottom he's a heart of
Enter Input : gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what a regiment it was, too," cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified
Enter Input : at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant
Enter Input : to them all. "Excuse me, Captain," he began easily, suddenly addressing
Enter Input : Nikodim Fomitch, "will you enter into my position?... I am ready to
Enter Input : ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick
Enter Input : and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not
Enter Input : studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I
Enter Input : have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to
Enter Input : me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so
Enter Input : exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the
Enter Input : last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I
Enter Input : don't understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this
Enter Input : I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But that is not our business, you know," the head clerk was observing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain..."
Enter Input : Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying
Enter Input : his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently
Enter Input : appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously
Enter Input : oblivious of him. "Allow me to explain that I have been living with her
Enter Input : for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not
Enter Input : confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it
Enter Input : was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked
Enter Input : her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...
Enter Input : that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those
Enter Input : days, and I led a life of... I was very heedless..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we've no time to
Enter Input : waste," Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;
Enter Input : but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it
Enter Input : exceedingly difficult to speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all
Enter Input : happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
Enter Input : But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as
Enter Input : before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said
Enter Input : to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,
Enter Input : but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen
Enter Input : roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,
Enter Input : she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,
Enter Input : never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay
Enter Input : of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to
Enter Input : eat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All these affecting details are no business of ours." Ilya Petrovitch
Enter Input : interrupted rudely. "You must give a written undertaking but as for your
Enter Input : love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with
Enter Input : that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come now... you are harsh," muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at
Enter Input : the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Write!" said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Write what?" the latter asked, gruffly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will dictate to you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and
Enter Input : contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt
Enter Input : completely indifferent to anyone's opinion, and this revulsion took
Enter Input : place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,
Enter Input : he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like
Enter Input : that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had
Enter Input : those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not
Enter Input : with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he
Enter Input : would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A
Enter Input : gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took
Enter Input : conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental
Enter Input : effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter's
Enter Input : triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.
Enter Input : Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty
Enter Input : vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been
Enter Input : sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would
Enter Input : hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to
Enter Input : him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but
Enter Input : he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could
Enter Input : never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental
Enter Input : effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that
Enter Input : if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,
Enter Input : it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any
Enter Input : circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful
Enter Input : sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a
Enter Input : conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the
Enter Input : sensations he had known in his life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,
Enter Input : that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that
Enter Input : he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you can't write, you can hardly hold the pen," observed the head
Enter Input : clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. "Are you ill?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I am giddy. Go on!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all. Sign it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,
Enter Input : he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He
Enter Input : felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea
Enter Input : suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim
Enter Input : Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then
Enter Input : to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole
Enter Input : in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat
Enter Input : to carry it out. "Hadn't I better think a minute?" flashed through his
Enter Input : mind. "No, better cast off the burden without thinking." But all at once
Enter Input : he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly
Enter Input : with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's impossible, they'll both be released. To begin with, the whole
Enter Input : story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it
Enter Input : had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,
Enter Input : that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at
Enter Input : the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking
Enter Input : with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the
Enter Input : porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he
Enter Input : have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for
Enter Input : Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith's below, before he went
Enter Input : up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now
Enter Input : just consider..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state
Enter Input : themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes
Enter Input : later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was
Enter Input : unfastened."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself
Enter Input : in; and they'd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been
Enter Input : an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the
Enter Input : interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing
Enter Input : himself and saying: 'If I had been there, he would have jumped out and
Enter Input : killed me with his axe.' He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,
Enter Input : ha!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And no one saw the murderer?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah's Ark," said
Enter Input : the head clerk, who was listening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's clear, quite clear," Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it is anything but clear," Ilya Petrovitch maintained.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did
Enter Input : not reach it....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,
Enter Input : supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing
Enter Input : on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and
Enter Input : Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up
Enter Input : from the chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's this? Are you ill?" Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing," said the head clerk,
Enter Input : settling back in his place, and taking up his work again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you been ill long?" cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where
Enter Input : he, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at
Enter Input : the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Since yesterday," muttered Raskolnikov in reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you go out yesterday?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Though you were ill?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At what time?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "About seven."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And where did you go, my I ask?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Along the street."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Short and clear."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,
Enter Input : without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch's stare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He can scarcely stand upright. And you..." Nikodim Fomitch was
Enter Input : beginning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No matter," Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at
Enter Input : the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There
Enter Input : was a sudden silence. It was strange.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well, then," concluded Ilya Petrovitch, "we will not detain you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
Enter Input : departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim
Enter Input : Fomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A search--there will be a search at once," he repeated to himself,
Enter Input : hurrying home. "The brutes! they suspect."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His former terror mastered him completely again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my
Enter Input : room?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.
Enter Input : Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left
Enter Input : all those things in the hole?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the
Enter Input : things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in
Enter Input : all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly
Enter Input : looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,
Enter Input : merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked
Enter Input : like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his
Enter Input : overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal
Enter Input : them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of
Enter Input : his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and
Enter Input : though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of
Enter Input : pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an
Enter Input : hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at
Enter Input : all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything
Enter Input : up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....
Enter Input : Where was he to go?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That had long been settled: "Fling them into the canal, and all traces
Enter Input : hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end." So he had decided in
Enter Input : the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to
Enter Input : get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get
Enter Input : rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along
Enter Input : the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked
Enter Input : several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not
Enter Input : think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge,
Enter Input : and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and
Enter Input : people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed
Enter Input : from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go
Enter Input : down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if
Enter Input : the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.
Enter Input : Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if
Enter Input : they had nothing to do but to watch him. "Why is it, or can it be my
Enter Input : fancy?" he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
Enter Input : Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,
Enter Input : and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further
Enter Input : off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,
Enter Input : worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it
Enter Input : before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply
Enter Input : because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent
Enter Input : and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way
Enter Input : another idea struck him. "Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go
Enter Input : somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things
Enter Input : in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot
Enter Input : perhaps?" And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea
Enter Input : seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For
Enter Input : coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a
Enter Input : passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right
Enter Input : hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far
Enter Input : into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for
Enter Input : twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here
Enter Input : was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was
Enter Input : lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,
Enter Input : apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It
Enter Input : was probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole place
Enter Input : from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to
Enter Input : throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and
Enter Input : at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where
Enter Input : there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had
Enter Input : been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, "Standing here
Enter Input : strictly forbidden." This was all the better, for there would be nothing
Enter Input : suspicious about his going in. "Here I could throw it all in a heap and
Enter Input : get away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed
Enter Input : against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn
Enter Input : stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a
Enter Input : street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he
Enter Input : could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the
Enter Input : street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,
Enter Input : and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small
Enter Input : hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.
Enter Input : The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he
Enter Input : seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was
Enter Input : in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But
Enter Input : he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.
Enter Input : Nothing could be noticed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,
Enter Input : almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in
Enter Input : the police-office. "I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of
Enter Input : looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since
Enter Input : the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were
Enter Input : found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!" And he laughed.
Enter Input : Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless
Enter Input : laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But
Enter Input : when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come
Enter Input : upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his
Enter Input : mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat
Enter Input : on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it
Enter Input : would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had
Enter Input : given the twenty copecks: "Damn him!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now
Enter Input : seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there
Enter Input : really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that
Enter Input : point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Damn it all!" he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.
Enter Input : "If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how
Enter Input : stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned
Enter Input : upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I
Enter Input : care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It
Enter Input : is not that at all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple
Enter Input : question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if
Enter Input : I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even
Enter Input : glance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I have
Enter Input : undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,
Enter Input : filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the
Enter Input : water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen
Enter Input : either... how's that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and
Enter Input : it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night
Enter Input : without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though
Enter Input : it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and
Enter Input : understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the
Enter Input : moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out
Enter Input : of it.... Yes, so it was.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is because I am very ill," he decided grimly at last, "I have been
Enter Input : worrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing....
Enter Input : Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been
Enter Input : worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what
Enter Input : if I don't get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some
Enter Input : distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new
Enter Input : overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him
Enter Input : every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for
Enter Input : everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.
Enter Input : All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their
Enter Input : movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he
Enter Input : might have spat at him or bitten him....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near
Enter Input : the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. "Why, he lives here, in that house,"
Enter Input : he thought, "why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here
Enter Input : it's the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;
Enter Input : have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never
Enter Input : mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the
Enter Input : day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further
Enter Input : now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and
Enter Input : he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each
Enter Input : other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on
Enter Input : his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it you?" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a
Enter Input : brief pause, he whistled. "As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've
Enter Input : cut me out!" he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. "Come sit down,
Enter Input : you are tired, I'll be bound."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was
Enter Input : in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his
Enter Input : visitor was ill.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?" He began feeling his
Enter Input : pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Never mind," he said, "I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I
Enter Input : wanted,... but I don't really want lessons...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I say! You are delirious, you know!" Razumihin observed, watching
Enter Input : him carefully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I am not."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to
Enter Input : Razumihin's, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend
Enter Input : face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all
Enter Input : disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the
Enter Input : wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at
Enter Input : himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye," he said abruptly, and walked to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stop, stop! You queer fish."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't want to," said the other, again pulling away his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this
Enter Input : is... almost insulting! I won't let you go like that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could
Enter Input : help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I
Enter Input : mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?
Enter Input : Nothing at all... no one's services... no one's sympathy. I am by
Enter Input : myself... alone. Come, that's enough. Leave me alone."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all
Enter Input : I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, but
Enter Input : there's a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.
Enter Input : I would not exchange him for five lessons. He's doing publishing of a
Enter Input : kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they
Enter Input : have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I
Enter Input : was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!
Enter Input : Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of
Enter Input : anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of
Enter Input : the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses
Enter Input : the question, 'Is woman a human being?' And, of course, triumphantly
Enter Input : proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a
Enter Input : contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand
Enter Input : these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous
Enter Input : title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He
Enter Input : pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles
Enter Input : for the job, and I've had six already in advance. When we have finished
Enter Input : this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of
Enter Input : the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have
Enter Input : marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was
Enter Input : a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don't contradict him, hang him!
Enter Input : Well, would you like to do the second signature of '_Is woman a human
Enter Input : being?_' If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those
Enter Input : are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in
Enter Input : advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.
Enter Input : And when you have finished the signature there will be another three
Enter Input : roubles for you. And please don't think I am doing you a service; quite
Enter Input : the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to
Enter Input : begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly
Enter Input : adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.
Enter Input : The only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better.
Enter Input : Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse. Will you take
Enter Input : it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles
Enter Input : and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
Enter Input : But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the
Enter Input : stairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German article
Enter Input : and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you raving, or what?" Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.
Enter Input : "What farce is this? You'll drive me crazy too... what did you come to
Enter Input : see me for, damn you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't want... translation," muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then what the devil do you want?" shouted Razumihin from above.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hey, there! Where are you living?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, confound you then!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky
Enter Input : Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant
Enter Input : incident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him
Enter Input : a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under
Enter Input : his horses' hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the
Enter Input : railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle
Enter Input : of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
Enter Input : He heard laughter, of course.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Serves him right!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A pickpocket I dare say."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on
Enter Input : purpose; and you have to answer for him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a regular profession, that's what it is."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered
Enter Input : after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt
Enter Input : someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman
Enter Input : in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter
Enter Input : wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Take it, my good man, in Christ's name."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From
Enter Input : his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar
Enter Input : asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he
Enter Input : doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and
Enter Input : turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without
Enter Input : a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the
Enter Input : Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the
Enter Input : bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,
Enter Input : and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
Enter Input : The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one
Enter Input : uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood
Enter Input : still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was
Enter Input : especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had
Enter Input : hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,
Enter Input : gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at
Enter Input : a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely
Enter Input : cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered
Enter Input : every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting
Enter Input : himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled
Enter Input : those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was
Enter Input : no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and
Enter Input : grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,
Enter Input : as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be
Enter Input : interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...
Enter Input : so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his
Enter Input : heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him
Enter Input : now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,
Enter Input : his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He
Enter Input : felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing
Enter Input : from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he
Enter Input : suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his
Enter Input : hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into
Enter Input : the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut
Enter Input : himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been
Enter Input : walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.
Enter Input : Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the
Enter Input : sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a
Enter Input : scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,
Enter Input : blows and curses he had never heard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he
Enter Input : sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing
Enter Input : and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement
Enter Input : he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and
Enter Input : wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make
Enter Input : out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be
Enter Input : beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of
Enter Input : her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost
Enter Input : a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly
Enter Input : and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov
Enter Input : trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.
Enter Input : Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,
Enter Input : banging her head against the steps--that's clear, that can be told
Enter Input : from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world
Enter Input : topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys
Enter Input : and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors
Enter Input : banging. "But why, why, and how could it be?" he repeated, thinking
Enter Input : seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And
Enter Input : they would come to him then next, "for no doubt... it's all about
Enter Input : that... about yesterday.... Good God!" He would have fastened his door
Enter Input : with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would
Enter Input : be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed
Enter Input : him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,
Enter Input : began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya
Enter Input : Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,
Enter Input : too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. "Can he have
Enter Input : gone away? Good Lord!" Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still
Enter Input : weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was
Enter Input : going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling
Enter Input : to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a
Enter Input : whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates
Enter Input : of the block. "But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come
Enter Input : here!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He
Enter Input : lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of
Enter Input : infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright
Enter Input : light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate
Enter Input : of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not
Enter Input : asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she
Enter Input : had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudging
Enter Input : about all day, and you're shaking with fever."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She looked intently at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who beat the landlady?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant
Enter Input : superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,
Enter Input : and... why was he here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a
Enter Input : long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nastasya, why don't you speak?" he said timidly at last in a weak
Enter Input : voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's the blood," she answered at last softly, as though speaking to
Enter Input : herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Blood? What blood?" he muttered, growing white and turning towards the
Enter Input : wall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nobody has been beating the landlady," she declared at last in a firm,
Enter Input : resolute voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up," he
Enter Input : said still more timidly. "I listened a long while. The assistant
Enter Input : superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the
Enter Input : flats."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No one has been here. That's the blood crying in your ears. When
Enter Input : there's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying
Enter Input : things.... Will you eat something?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give me something to drink... Nastasya."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.
Enter Input : He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling
Enter Input : some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he
Enter Input : was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
Enter Input : He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though
Enter Input : there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away
Enter Input : somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about
Enter Input : him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid
Enter Input : of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;
Enter Input : they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked
Enter Input : at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished
Enter Input : another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could
Enter Input : not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.
Enter Input : Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times
Enter Input : it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had
Enter Input : no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten
Enter Input : something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying
Enter Input : to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable
Enter Input : terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone
Enter Input : always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and
Enter Input : forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened at ten o'clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone
Enter Input : into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right
Enter Input : wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him
Enter Input : with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him
Enter Input : very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,
Enter Input : short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was
Enter Input : peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who is this, Nastasya?" he asked, pointing to the young man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, he's himself again!" she said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is himself," echoed the man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the
Enter Input : door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or
Enter Input : discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat
Enter Input : and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and
Enter Input : laziness, and absurdly bashful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who... are you?" he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment
Enter Input : the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,
Enter Input : Razumihin came in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a cabin it is!" he cried. "I am always knocking my head. You call
Enter Input : this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I've just heard the news
Enter Input : from Pashenka."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has just come to," said Nastasya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Just come to," echoed the man again, with a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And who are you?" Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. "My name is
Enter Input : Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but
Enter Input : Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are
Enter Input : you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and
Enter Input : I've come on business."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Please sit down." Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the
Enter Input : table. "It's a good thing you've come to, brother," he went on to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. "For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk
Enter Input : anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see
Enter Input : you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at
Enter Input : once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.
Enter Input : Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not
Enter Input : had enough beer and radish, but it's nothing much, it will pass and you
Enter Input : will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a
Enter Input : name. Come, I won't keep you," he said, addressing the man again. "Will
Enter Input : you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time
Enter Input : they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I
Enter Input : talked to him. Who was it came before?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,
Enter Input : sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He was more intelligent than you, don't you think so?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so; go on."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At your mamma's request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom
Enter Input : I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you
Enter Input : from our office," the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. "If you are in
Enter Input : an intelligible condition, I've thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as
Enter Input : Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma's
Enter Input : request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you
Enter Input : know him, sir?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I remember... Vahrushin," Raskolnikov said dreamily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You hear, he knows Vahrushin," cried Razumihin. "He is in 'an
Enter Input : intelligible condition'! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,
Enter Input : it's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request
Enter Input : of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the
Enter Input : same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent
Enter Input : instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you
Enter Input : thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That 'hoping for better to come' is the best thing you've said, though
Enter Input : 'your mamma' is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully
Enter Input : conscious, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all right. If only he can sign this little paper."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, here's the book."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I'll hold you. Take the pen and
Enter Input : scribble 'Raskolnikov' for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter
Enter Input : to us than treacle."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't want it," said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not want it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't sign it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How the devil can you do without signing it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't want... the money."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't want the money! Come, brother, that's nonsense, I bear witness.
Enter Input : Don't trouble, please, it's only that he is on his travels again. But
Enter Input : that's pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of
Enter Input : judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his
Enter Input : hand and he will sign it. Here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I can come another time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,
Enter Input : Rodya, don't keep your visitor, you see he is waiting," and he made
Enter Input : ready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stop, I'll do it alone," said the latter, taking the pen and signing
Enter Input : his name.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The messenger took out the money and went away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," answered Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is there any soup?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Some of yesterday's," answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "With potatoes and rice in it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,
Enter Input : unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what
Enter Input : would happen. "I believe I am not wandering. I believe it's reality," he
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced
Enter Input : that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two
Enter Input : spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The
Enter Input : table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us
Enter Input : up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you are a cool hand," muttered Nastasya, and she departed to
Enter Input : carry out his orders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile
Enter Input : Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his
Enter Input : left arm round Raskolnikov's head, although he was able to sit up, and
Enter Input : with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that
Enter Input : it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after
Enter Input : giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and
Enter Input : said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And will you have tea?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on
Enter Input : without the faculty. But here is the beer!" He moved back to his chair,
Enter Input : pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he
Enter Input : had not touched food for three days.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now," he
Enter Input : mumbled with his mouth full of beef, "and it's all Pashenka, your dear
Enter Input : little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I
Enter Input : don't ask for it, but, of course, I don't object. And here's Nastasya
Enter Input : with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won't you have
Enter Input : some beer?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get along with your nonsense!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A cup of tea, then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A cup of tea, maybe."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pour it out. Stay, I'll pour it out myself. Sit down."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As
Enter Input : before, he put his left arm round the sick man's head, raised him up
Enter Input : and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and
Enter Input : earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective
Enter Input : means towards his friend's recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made
Enter Input : no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa
Enter Input : without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but
Enter Input : even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost
Enter Input : animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying
Enter Input : low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession
Enter Input : of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
Enter Input : Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen
Enter Input : spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away
Enter Input : capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real
Enter Input : pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed
Enter Input : that, too, and took note of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some
Enter Input : raspberry tea," said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking
Enter Input : his soup and beer again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And where is she to get raspberries for you?" asked Nastasya, balancing
Enter Input : a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of
Enter Input : sugar.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She'll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things
Enter Input : have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in
Enter Input : that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I
Enter Input : resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.
Enter Input : How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had
Enter Input : forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know
Enter Input : it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the
Enter Input : Five Corners, Harlamov's house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov's
Enter Input : house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov's, but
Enter Input : Buch's. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I
Enter Input : went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in
Enter Input : two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My name!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while
Enter Input : I was there. Well, it's a long story. But as soon as I did land on this
Enter Input : place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know
Enter Input : everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of
Enter Input : Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.
Enter Input : Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,
Enter Input : and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's got round her," Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why don't you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a one!" Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. "I am
Enter Input : not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna," she added suddenly, recovering from her
Enter Input : mirth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,
Enter Input : I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant
Enter Input : influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not
Enter Input : expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you
Enter Input : think?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,
Enter Input : full of alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect," Razumihin went
Enter Input : on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, the sly dog!" Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded
Enter Input : her unspeakable delight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way
Enter Input : at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so
Enter Input : to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her
Enter Input : character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that
Enter Input : she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been
Enter Input : mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,
Enter Input : Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that's
Enter Input : a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of
Enter Input : foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as
Enter Input : you would think at first sight?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No," mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better
Enter Input : to keep up the conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She isn't, is she?" cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out
Enter Input : of him. "But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,
Enter Input : essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,
Enter Input : I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and
Enter Input : of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her
Enter Input : intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a
Enter Input : sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!
Enter Input : I don't understand it! Well, that's all nonsense. Only, seeing that you
Enter Input : are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and
Enter Input : that through the young lady's death she has no need to treat you as
Enter Input : a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and
Enter Input : dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.
Enter Input : And she's been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose
Enter Input : the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost
Enter Input : a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point
Enter Input : Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have
Enter Input : thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but
Enter Input : the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the
Enter Input : question, 'Is there any hope of realising the I O U?' Answer: there is,
Enter Input : because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
Enter Input : twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,
Enter Input : too, who would go into bondage for his sake. That's what he was building
Enter Input : upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs
Enter Input : now, my dear boy--it's not for nothing that you were so open with
Enter Input : Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as
Enter Input : a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is
Enter Input : open; and a business man 'listens and goes on eating' you up. Well,
Enter Input : then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without
Enter Input : hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this
Enter Input : I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time
Enter Input : harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping
Enter Input : the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,
Enter Input : brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten
Enter Input : roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of
Enter Input : presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I
Enter Input : have torn it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and
Enter Input : turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a
Enter Input : twinge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I see, brother," he said a moment later, "that I have been playing the
Enter Input : fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe
Enter Input : I have only made you cross."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?" Raskolnikov
Enter Input : asked, after a moment's pause without turning his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought
Enter Input : Zametov one day."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Zametov? The head clerk? What for?" Raskolnikov turned round quickly
Enter Input : and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to
Enter Input : make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How
Enter Input : could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital
Enter Input : fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are
Enter Input : friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,
Enter Input : you know. I have only just moved. I've been with him to Luise Ivanovna
Enter Input : once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did I say anything in delirium?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think so! You were beside yourself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What did I rave about?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,
Enter Input : brother, now I must not lose time. To work." He got up from the table
Enter Input : and took up his cap.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What did I rave about?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don't
Enter Input : worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot
Enter Input : about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky
Enter Input : Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the
Enter Input : assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest
Enter Input : to you was your own sock. You whined, 'Give me my sock.' Zametov
Enter Input : hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,
Enter Input : ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you
Enter Input : comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched
Enter Input : thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely
Enter Input : somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so
Enter Input : piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort
Enter Input : of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are
Enter Input : thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account
Enter Input : of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,
Enter Input : though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And
Enter Input : you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he
Enter Input : wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted
Enter Input : myself. Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he's a deep one!" said Nastasya as he went
Enter Input : out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist
Enter Input : running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would
Enter Input : say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the
Enter Input : bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching
Enter Input : impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to
Enter Input : work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What
Enter Input : if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,
Enter Input : and then they will come in and tell me that it's been discovered long
Enter Input : ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That's what I've
Enter Input : forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered
Enter Input : a minute ago."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment
Enter Input : about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not
Enter Input : what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to
Enter Input : the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,
Enter Input : put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the
Enter Input : stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of
Enter Input : his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as
Enter Input : he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock
Enter Input : about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on
Enter Input : the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that
Enter Input : Zametov could not have seen anything on it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police
Enter Input : office? Where's the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I
Enter Input : looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But
Enter Input : what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?" he muttered,
Enter Input : helplessly sitting on the sofa again. "What does it mean? Am I still in
Enter Input : delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must
Enter Input : escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but
Enter Input : where? And where are my clothes? I've no boots. They've taken them away!
Enter Input : They've hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that
Enter Input : over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here's the I O U...
Enter Input : I'll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won't find
Enter Input : me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They'll find me, Razumihin will find
Enter Input : me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them
Enter Input : do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What
Enter Input : else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don't know that I can walk,
Enter Input : ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If
Enter Input : only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch
Enter Input : there--policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a
Enter Input : bottle, cold!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and
Enter Input : gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.
Enter Input : But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and
Enter Input : even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the
Enter Input : quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more
Enter Input : disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With
Enter Input : a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more
Enter Input : closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,
Enter Input : ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing
Enter Input : sleep.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw
Enter Input : Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or
Enter Input : not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though
Enter Input : trying to recall something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!"
Enter Input : Razumihin shouted down the stairs. "You shall have the account
Enter Input : directly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What time is it?" asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it's almost evening, it will be six
Enter Input : o'clock directly. You have slept more than six hours."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! Have I?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And why not? It will do you good. What's the hurry? A tryst, is it?
Enter Input : We've all time before us. I've been waiting for the last three hours for
Enter Input : you; I've been up twice and found you asleep. I've called on Zossimov
Enter Input : twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And
Enter Input : I've been out on my own business, too. You know I've been moving to-day,
Enter Input : moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that's
Enter Input : no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it
Enter Input : directly. And how do you feel now, brother?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I tell you I've been waiting for the last three hours."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, before."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How long have you been coming here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why I told you all about it this morning. Don't you remember?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could
Enter Input : not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm!" said the latter, "he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were
Enter Input : not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really
Enter Input : look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear
Enter Input : boy."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we
Enter Input : must make a man of you. Let's begin from the top. Do you see this
Enter Input : cap?" he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and
Enter Input : ordinary cap. "Let me try it on."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Presently, afterwards," said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, Rodya, my boy, don't oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and
Enter Input : I shan't sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.
Enter Input : Just right!" he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, "just your size! A
Enter Input : proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in
Enter Input : its own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off
Enter Input : his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other
Enter Input : people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish
Enter Input : politeness, but it's simply because he is ashamed of his bird's nest;
Enter Input : he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of
Enter Input : headgear: this Palmerston"--he took from the corner Raskolnikov's old,
Enter Input : battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--"or
Enter Input : this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,
Enter Input : Nastasya!" he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not
Enter Input : speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say," answered Nastasya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Twenty copecks, silly!" he cried, offended. "Why, nowadays you would
Enter Input : cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been
Enter Input : worn. And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they will
Enter Input : give you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to
Enter Input : the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure
Enter Input : you I am proud of these breeches," and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a
Enter Input : pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. "No holes, no
Enter Input : spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat
Enter Input : to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an
Enter Input : improvement, it's softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,
Enter Input : the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the
Enter Input : seasons; if you don't insist on having asparagus in January, you keep
Enter Input : your money in your purse; and it's the same with this purchase. It's
Enter Input : summer now, so I've been buying summer things--warmer materials will be
Enter Input : wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...
Enter Input : especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of
Enter Input : coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What
Enter Input : do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:
Enter Input : if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only
Enter Input : do business on that system at Fedyaev's; if you've bought a thing once,
Enter Input : you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your
Enter Input : own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are
Enter Input : a bit worn, but they'll last a couple of months, for it's foreign work
Enter Input : and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last
Enter Input : week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.
Enter Input : Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But perhaps they won't fit," observed Nastasya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not fit? Just look!" and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov's
Enter Input : old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. "I did not go
Enter Input : empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.
Enter Input : And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin
Enter Input : with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well
Enter Input : now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the
Enter Input : suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the
Enter Input : boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles
Enter Input : fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were
Enter Input : bought in the lo--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
Enter Input : Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,
Enter Input : you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will
Enter Input : serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one's
Enter Input : clothes from Sharmer's! As for your socks and other things, I leave them
Enter Input : to you; we've twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying
Enter Input : for your lodging, don't you worry. I tell you she'll trust you for
Enter Input : anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you
Enter Input : will throw off your illness with your shirt."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me be! I don't want to!" Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened
Enter Input : with disgust to Razumihin's efforts to be playful about his purchases.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing,"
Enter Input : Razumihin insisted. "Nastasya, don't be bashful, but help me--that's
Enter Input : it," and in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance he changed his linen. The
Enter Input : latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It will be long before I get rid of them," he thought. "What money was
Enter Input : all that bought with?" he asked at last, gazing at the wall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your
Enter Input : mother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I remember now," said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.
Enter Input : Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar
Enter Input : to Raskolnikov came in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face
Enter Input : and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on
Enter Input : his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable
Enter Input : loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,
Enter Input : fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his
Enter Input : watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,
Enter Input : nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made
Enter Input : efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every
Enter Input : instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever
Enter Input : at his work.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he's come to himself,"
Enter Input : cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?" said Zossimov to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the
Enter Input : sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is still depressed," Razumihin went on. "We've just changed his
Enter Input : linen and he almost cried."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish
Enter Input : it.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am well, I am perfectly well!" Raskolnikov declared positively
Enter Input : and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with
Enter Input : glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to
Enter Input : the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very good.... Going on all right," he said lazily. "Has he eaten
Enter Input : anything?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They told him, and asked what he might have.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of
Enter Input : course, you must not give him; he'd better not have meat either, and...
Enter Input : but no need to tell you that!" Razumihin and he looked at each
Enter Input : other. "No more medicine or anything. I'll look at him again to-morrow.
Enter Input : Perhaps, to-day even... but never mind..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk," said Razumihin. "We are
Enter Input : going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don't know... a little,
Enter Input : maybe... but we'll see."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, what a nuisance! I've got a house-warming party to-night; it's
Enter Input : only a step from here. Couldn't he come? He could lie on the sofa. You
Enter Input : are coming?" Razumihin said to Zossimov. "Don't forget, you promised."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our
Enter Input : friends."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And who?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and
Enter Input : he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some
Enter Input : business of his. We meet once in five years."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is he?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a
Enter Input : little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I
Enter Input : am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation
Enter Input : Department here... But you know him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is he a relation of yours, too?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled
Enter Input : once, won't you come then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't care a damn for him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a
Enter Input : government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do tell me, please, what you or he"--Zossimov nodded at
Enter Input : Raskolnikov--"can have in common with this Zametov?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,
Enter Input : as it were by springs; you won't venture to turn round on your own
Enter Input : account. If a man is a nice fellow, that's the only principle I go upon.
Enter Input : Zametov is a delightful person."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Though he does take bribes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, he does! and what of it? I don't care if he does take bribes,"
Enter Input : Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. "I don't praise him for
Enter Input : taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one
Enter Input : looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure
Enter Input : I shouldn't be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown
Enter Input : in."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's too little; I'd give two for you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And I wouldn't give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!
Enter Input : Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him
Enter Input : not repel him. You'll never improve a man by repelling him, especially
Enter Input : a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive
Enter Input : dullards! You don't understand. You harm yourselves running another man
Enter Input : down.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should like to know what."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, it's all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of
Enter Input : a mess! Though indeed there's nothing to fear now. The matter is
Enter Input : absolutely self-evident. We only put on steam."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A painter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, haven't I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then
Enter Input : about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed
Enter Input : up in it..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...
Enter Input : partly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta was murdered, too," Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door
Enter Input : listening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta," murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn't you know her? She used to come
Enter Input : here. She mended a shirt for you, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he
Enter Input : picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began
Enter Input : examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the
Enter Input : petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless
Enter Input : as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared
Enter Input : obstinately at the flower.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what about the painter?" Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatter
Enter Input : with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, he was accused of the murder," Razumihin went on hotly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was there evidence against him then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what we
Enter Input : have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and
Enter Input : Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it's all done, it makes one
Enter Input : sick, though it's not one's business! Pestryakov may be coming
Enter Input : to-night.... By the way, Rodya, you've heard about the business already;
Enter Input : it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the
Enter Input : police office while they were talking about it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!"
Enter Input : Zossimov observed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway," shouted Razumihin,
Enter Input : bringing his fist down on the table. "What's the most offensive is not
Enter Input : their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,
Enter Input : for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship
Enter Input : their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at
Enter Input : first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter
Enter Input : it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the
Enter Input : murderers--that was their logic!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not
Enter Input : help that.... And, by the way, I've met that man Koch. He used to buy
Enter Input : unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession
Enter Input : of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It's their
Enter Input : sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means
Enter Input : of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data
Enter Input : alone how to get on the track of the real man. 'We have facts,' they
Enter Input : say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in
Enter Input : how you interpret them!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Can you interpret them, then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Anyway, one can't hold one's tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible
Enter Input : feeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the
Enter Input : details of the case?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am waiting to hear about the painter."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, yes! Well, here's the story. Early on the third day after the
Enter Input : murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they
Enter Input : accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an
Enter Input : unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a
Enter Input : dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller's
Enter Input : case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. 'The
Enter Input : day before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'--mark the day and the
Enter Input : hour!--'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me
Enter Input : already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and
Enter Input : asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got
Enter Input : them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him
Enter Input : anything more.' I am telling you Dushkin's story. 'I gave him a note'--a
Enter Input : rouble that is--'for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
Enter Input : with another. It would all come to the same thing--he'd spend it on
Enter Input : drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it
Enter Input : the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any
Enter Input : rumours, I'll take it to the police.' Of course, that's all taradiddle;
Enter Input : he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and
Enter Input : a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a
Enter Input : thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply
Enter Input : afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story. 'I've known
Enter Input : this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same
Enter Input : province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though
Enter Input : Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that
Enter Input : house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.
Enter Input : As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,
Enter Input : took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.
Enter Input : And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and
Enter Input : her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt
Enter Input : suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman
Enter Input : lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful
Enter Input : inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, "Is
Enter Input : Nikolay here?" Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he
Enter Input : had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,
Enter Input : and went out again. Dmitri didn't see him again and is finishing the
Enter Input : job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on
Enter Input : the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to
Enter Input : anyone'--that's Dushkin's tale--'but I found out what I could about
Enter Input : the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight
Enter Input : o'clock this morning'--that was the third day, you understand--'I saw
Enter Input : Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could
Enter Input : understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not
Enter Input : speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep
Enter Input : on a bench and our two boys. "Have you seen Dmitri?" said I. "No, I
Enter Input : haven't," said he. "And you've not been here either?" "Not since the day
Enter Input : before yesterday," said he. "And where did you sleep last night?"
Enter Input : "In Peski, with the Kolomensky men." "And where did you get those
Enter Input : ear-rings?" I asked. "I found them in the street," and the way he said
Enter Input : it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. "Did you hear what happened
Enter Input : that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?" said I.
Enter Input : "No," said he, "I had not heard," and all the while he was listening,
Enter Input : his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I
Enter Input : told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted
Enter Input : to keep him. "Wait a bit, Nikolay," said I, "won't you have a drink?"
Enter Input : And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the
Enter Input : bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
Enter Input : I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his
Enter Input : doing, as clear as could be....'"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think so," said Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;
Enter Input : they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;
Enter Input : the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before
Enter Input : yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He
Enter Input : had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram
Enter Input : for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went
Enter Input : to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable
Enter Input : adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a
Enter Input : block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman
Enter Input : screeched her hardest; people ran in. 'So that's what you are up to!'
Enter Input : 'Take me,' he says, 'to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confess
Enter Input : everything.' Well, they took him to that police station--that is
Enter Input : here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old
Enter Input : he is, 'twenty-two,' and so on. At the question, 'When you were working
Enter Input : with Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a
Enter Input : time?'--answer: 'To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did
Enter Input : not notice them.' 'And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on?'
Enter Input : 'We heard nothing special.' 'And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same
Enter Input : day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?' 'I
Enter Input : never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy
Enter Input : Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.' 'And where did you find the
Enter Input : ear-rings?' 'I found them on the pavement.' 'Why didn't you go to work
Enter Input : with Dmitri the other day?' 'Because I was drinking.' 'And where were
Enter Input : you drinking?' 'Oh, in such-and-such a place.' 'Why did you run away
Enter Input : from Dushkin's?' 'Because I was awfully frightened.' 'What were
Enter Input : you frightened of?' 'That I should be accused.' 'How could you be
Enter Input : frightened, if you felt free from guilt?' Now, Zossimov, you may not
Enter Input : believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it
Enter Input : for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, anyway, there's the evidence."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,
Enter Input : of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed
Enter Input : him and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat
Enter Input : where I was painting with Dmitri.' 'And how was that?' 'Why, Dmitri and
Enter Input : I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and
Enter Input : Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.
Enter Input : I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I
Enter Input : ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen
Enter Input : were there I don't remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other
Enter Input : porter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too;
Enter Input : and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,
Enter Input : too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri's
Enter Input : hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught
Enter Input : me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper
Enter Input : but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into
Enter Input : the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back
Enter Input : to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them
Enter Input : together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the
Enter Input : corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped
Enter Input : up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,
Enter Input : and in the box were the ear-rings....'"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?" Raskolnikov
Enter Input : cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he
Enter Input : slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... why? What's the matter? What's wrong?" Razumihin, too, got up
Enter Input : from his seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing," Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were
Enter Input : silent for a while.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He must have waked from a dream," Razumihin said at last, looking
Enter Input : inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, go on," said Zossimov. "What next?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and
Enter Input : everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got
Enter Input : a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and
Enter Input : went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:
Enter Input : 'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.'
Enter Input : 'And why didn't you come to the police till now?' 'I was frightened.'
Enter Input : 'And why did you try to hang yourself?' 'From anxiety.' 'What anxiety?'
Enter Input : 'That I should be accused of it.' Well, that's the whole story. And now
Enter Input : what do you suppose they deduced from that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, there's no supposing. There's a clue, such as it is, a fact. You
Enter Input : wouldn't have your painter set free?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now they've simply taken him for the murderer. They haven't a shadow of
Enter Input : doubt."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You
Enter Input : must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old
Enter Input : woman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come there
Enter Input : somehow. That's a good deal in such a case."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How did they get there? How did they get there?" cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : "How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more
Enter Input : opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail
Enter Input : to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don't you see at
Enter Input : once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy
Enter Input : truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped
Enter Input : on the box and picked it up."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The holy truth! But didn't he own himself that he told a lie at first?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov
Enter Input : and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
Enter Input : was sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got
Enter Input : out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his
Enter Input : arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on
Enter Input : the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his
Enter Input : hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the
Enter Input : thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they 'like children'
Enter Input : (the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,
Enter Input : squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing
Enter Input : one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful
Enter Input : note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they
Enter Input : found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open
Enter Input : the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one
Enter Input : question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish
Enter Input : scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,
Enter Input : robbery? They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for
Enter Input : the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing
Enter Input : that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they
Enter Input : rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.
Enter Input : And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed, but..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay's
Enter Input : hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important
Enter Input : piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation
Enter Input : given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously
Enter Input : against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him
Enter Input : innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And
Enter Input : do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will
Enter Input : accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting
Enter Input : simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively
Enter Input : breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they
Enter Input : won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-case
Enter Input : and the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if he
Enter Input : hadn't felt guilty.' That's the point, that's what excites me, you must
Enter Input : understand!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof
Enter Input : is there that the box came from the old woman?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's been proved," said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.
Enter Input : "Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who
Enter Input : proved conclusively that it was his."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time
Enter Input : that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no
Enter Input : evidence about that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nobody did see him," Razumihin answered with vexation. "That's the
Enter Input : worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way
Enter Input : upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.
Enter Input : They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going
Enter Input : on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether
Enter Input : there actually were men at work in it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating
Enter Input : one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...
Enter Input : How do you explain the facts yourself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At any
Enter Input : rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and
Enter Input : the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.
Enter Input : The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked
Enter Input : at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the
Enter Input : murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of
Enter Input : escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
Enter Input : Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the
Enter Input : porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of
Enter Input : hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri
Enter Input : and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;
Enter Input : possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going
Enter Input : in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when
Enter Input : he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he
Enter Input : had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that
Enter Input : he did stand there.... That's how I explain it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Too clever! No, my boy, you're too clever. That beats everything."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But, why, why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, because everything fits too well... it's too melodramatic."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ach!" Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened
Enter Input : and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,
Enter Input : and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the
Enter Input : doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,
Enter Input : as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.
Enter Input : Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost
Enter Input : affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow "cabin." With the
Enter Input : same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,
Enter Input : unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with
Enter Input : the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and
Enter Input : unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the
Enter Input : face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a
Enter Input : couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting
Enter Input : took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,
Enter Input : that he would get nothing in this "cabin" by attempting to overawe them,
Enter Input : the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,
Enter Input : emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not
Enter Input : Razumihin anticipated him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This familiar "what do you want" seemed to cut the ground from the
Enter Input : feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked
Enter Input : himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This is Raskolnikov," mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he
Enter Input : gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he
Enter Input : lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold
Enter Input : watch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly
Enter Input : and lazily proceeded to put it back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing
Enter Input : persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that
Enter Input : his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it
Enter Input : was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just
Enter Input : undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But
Enter Input : the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,
Enter Input : then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said "This is Raskolnikov"
Enter Input : he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but
Enter Input : weak and breaking, voice articulated:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name
Enter Input : is not wholly unknown to you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed
Enter Input : blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the
Enter Input : name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no
Enter Input : information?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands
Enter Input : behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into
Enter Input : Luzhin's face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively
Enter Input : than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I had presumed and calculated," he faltered, "that a letter posted more
Enter Input : than ten days, if not a fortnight ago..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, why are you standing in the doorway?" Razumihin interrupted
Enter Input : suddenly. "If you've something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so
Enter Input : crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here's a chair, thread your way in!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the
Enter Input : table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the
Enter Input : visitor to "thread his way in." The minute was so chosen that it was
Enter Input : impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying
Enter Input : and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at
Enter Input : Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No need to be nervous," the latter blurted out. "Rodya has been ill for
Enter Input : the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and
Enter Input : has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.
Enter Input : I am a comrade of Rodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I am
Enter Input : nursing him; so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with your
Enter Input : business."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and
Enter Input : conversation?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no," mumbled Zossimov; "you may amuse him." He yawned again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has been conscious a long time, since the morning," went on
Enter Input : Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature
Enter Input : that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,
Enter Input : because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a
Enter Input : student.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your mamma," began Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm!" Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him
Enter Input : inquiringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all right, go on."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in
Enter Input : her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to
Enter Input : elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully
Enter Input : assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my
Enter Input : astonishment..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know, I know!" Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.
Enter Input : "So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that's enough!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time,
Enter Input : but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all
Enter Input : meant. There was a moment's silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he
Enter Input : answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as
Enter Input : though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something
Enter Input : new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at
Enter Input : him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole
Enter Input : appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of "fiancé" so
Enter Input : unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far
Enter Input : too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few
Enter Input : days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation
Enter Input : of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,
Enter Input : indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the
Enter Input : agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such
Enter Input : circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of
Enter Input : fiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were all
Enter Input : right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even
Enter Input : the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The
Enter Input : exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,
Enter Input : if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in
Enter Input : his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch's attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,
Enter Input : light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a
Enter Input : cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best
Enter Input : of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even
Enter Input : handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.
Enter Input : His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,
Enter Input : growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,
Enter Input : touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled
Enter Input : at a hairdresser's, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair
Enter Input : usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.
Enter Input : If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather
Enter Input : good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other
Enter Input : causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled
Enter Input : malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as
Enter Input : before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no
Enter Input : notice of their oddities.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation," he began,
Enter Input : again breaking the silence with an effort. "If I had been aware of your
Enter Input : illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I
Enter Input : have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention
Enter Input : other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your
Enter Input : mamma and sister any minute."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed
Enter Input : some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing
Enter Input : followed, he went on:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where?" asked Raskolnikov weakly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's in Voskresensky," put in Razumihin. "There are two storeys of
Enter Input : rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, rooms..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtful
Enter Input : character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer
Enter Input : people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It's
Enter Input : cheap, though..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger
Enter Input : in Petersburg myself," Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. "However, the
Enter Input : two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...
Enter Input : I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat," he said,
Enter Input : addressing Raskolnikov, "and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am
Enter Input : myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me
Enter Input : of Bakaleyev's house, too..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lebeziatnikov?" said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you
Enter Input : know him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... no," Raskolnikov answered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....
Enter Input : A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one
Enter Input : learns new things from them." Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you mean?" asked Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the most serious and essential matters," Pyotr Petrovitch replied,
Enter Input : as though delighted at the question. "You see, it's ten years since I
Enter Input : visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in
Enter Input : the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.
Enter Input : And it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the
Enter Input : younger generation. And I confess I am delighted..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At what?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find
Enter Input : clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's true," Zossimov let drop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nonsense! There's no practicality." Razumihin flew at him.
Enter Input : "Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from
Enter Input : heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from
Enter Input : all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting," he said to
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch, "and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish
Enter Input : form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.
Enter Input : Anyway, there's no practicality. Practicality goes well shod."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't agree with you," Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident
Enter Input : enjoyment. "Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,
Enter Input : but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of
Enter Input : enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little
Enter Input : has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.
Enter Input : It's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been
Enter Input : accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are
Enter Input : circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.
Enter Input : Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been
Enter Input : rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves
Enter Input : off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great
Enter Input : thing..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's learnt it by heart to show off!" Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received
Enter Input : no reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all true," Zossimov hastened to interpose.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Isn't it so?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.
Enter Input : "You must admit," he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of
Enter Input : triumph and superciliousness--he almost added "young man"--"that there
Enter Input : is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and
Enter Input : economic truth..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A commonplace."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, 'love
Enter Input : thy neighbour,' what came of it?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with
Enter Input : excessive haste. "It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my
Enter Input : neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has
Enter Input : it, 'Catch several hares and you won't catch one.' Science now tells
Enter Input : us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on
Enter Input : self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly
Enter Input : and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private
Enter Input : affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the
Enter Input : firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare
Enter Input : organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for
Enter Input : myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to
Enter Input : pass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not
Enter Input : from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general
Enter Input : advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time
Enter Input : reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it
Enter Input : would seem to want very little wit to perceive it..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, I've very little wit myself," Razumihin cut in sharply,
Enter Input : "and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I've
Enter Input : grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse
Enter Input : oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,
Enter Input : by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a
Enter Input : hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you,
Enter Input : that's quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you
Enter Input : are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive
Enter Input : cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything
Enter Input : they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That's
Enter Input : enough!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive
Enter Input : dignity. "Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that's enough," Razumihin
Enter Input : concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous
Enter Input : conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up
Enter Input : his mind to take leave in another minute or two.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I trust our acquaintance," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "may, upon
Enter Input : your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,
Enter Input : become closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting
Enter Input : up from his chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One of her customers must have killed her," Zossimov declared
Enter Input : positively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not a doubt of it," replied Razumihin. "Porfiry doesn't give his
Enter Input : opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Examining them?" Raskolnikov asked aloud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes. What then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How does he get hold of them?" asked Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the
Enter Input : wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!
Enter Input : The coolness!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just what it wasn't!" interposed Razumihin. "That's what throws
Enter Input : you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not
Enter Input : practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that
Enter Input : it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work. Suppose
Enter Input : him to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance
Enter Input : that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee
Enter Input : obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth
Enter Input : ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the
Enter Input : old woman's trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,
Enter Input : besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know
Enter Input : how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,
Enter Input : his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good
Enter Input : counsel!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?" Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves
Enter Input : in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more
Enter Input : intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable
Enter Input : impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes. You've heard of it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know the details?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in the
Enter Input : case--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime
Enter Input : has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last
Enter Input : five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,
Enter Input : what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,
Enter Input : too, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a
Enter Input : student's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of
Enter Input : good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole
Enter Input : gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of
Enter Input : the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary
Enter Input : abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old
Enter Input : woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class
Enter Input : in society--for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain
Enter Input : this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are many economic changes," put in Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How are we to explain it?" Razumihin caught him up. "It might be
Enter Input : explained by our inveterate impracticality."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he
Enter Input : was forging notes? 'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I
Enter Input : want to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words,
Enter Input : but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or
Enter Input : working! We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking
Enter Input : on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour
Enter Input : struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :      [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.
Enter Input :      --TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But morality? And so to speak, principles..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why do you worry about it?" Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. "It's
Enter Input : in accordance with your theory!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In accordance with my theory?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and
Enter Input : it follows that people may be killed..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my word!" cried Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, that's not so," put in Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing
Enter Input : painfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's a measure in all things," Luzhin went on superciliously.
Enter Input : "Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to
Enter Input : suppose..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And is it true," Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a
Enter Input : voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, "is it true that
Enter Input : you told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what
Enter Input : pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better
Enter Input : to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over
Enter Input : her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my word," Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with
Enter Input : confusion, "to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to
Enter Input : assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,
Enter Input : has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect
Enter Input : who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed
Enter Input : to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat
Enter Input : high-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles
Enter Input : from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in
Enter Input : so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I tell you what," cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and
Enter Input : fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, "I tell you what."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?" Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.
Enter Input : Silence lasted for some seconds.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my
Enter Input : mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter with you?" cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So that's how it is?" Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. "Let me tell
Enter Input : you, sir," he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself
Enter Input : but breathing hard, "at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed
Enter Input : to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive
Enter Input : a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after
Enter Input : this..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not ill," cried Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So much the worse..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go to hell!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing
Enter Input : between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him
Enter Input : pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who
Enter Input : had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,
Enter Input : he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid
Enter Input : crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of
Enter Input : his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How could you--how could you!" Razumihin said, shaking his head in
Enter Input : perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me alone--let me alone all of you!" Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.
Enter Input : "Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am
Enter Input : not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,
Enter Input : alone, alone!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come along," said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But we can't leave him like this!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come along," Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin
Enter Input : thought a minute and ran to overtake him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It might be worse not to obey him," said Zossimov on the stairs. "He
Enter Input : mustn't be irritated."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter with him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If only he could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it! At
Enter Input : first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some
Enter Input : fixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation
Enter Input : I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a
Enter Input : letter about it just before his illness...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have
Enter Input : you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to
Enter Input : anything except one point on which he seems excited--that's the murder?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes," Razumihin agreed, "I noticed that, too. He is interested,
Enter Input : frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police
Enter Input : office; he fainted."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you something
Enter Input : afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I'll go and see
Enter Input : him again.... There'll be no inflammation though."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thanks! And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him
Enter Input : through Nastasya...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,
Enter Input : but she still lingered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Won't you have some tea now?" she asked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Later! I am sleepy! Leave me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the
Enter Input : parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again
Enter Input : and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become
Enter Input : perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic
Enter Input : fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange
Enter Input : sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was
Enter Input : evident in them. "To-day, to-day," he muttered to himself. He understood
Enter Input : that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him
Enter Input : strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not
Enter Input : fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he
Enter Input : looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment's thought
Enter Input : put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the
Enter Input : copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.
Enter Input : Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and
Enter Input : glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back
Enter Input : to him, blowing up the landlady's samovar. She heard nothing. Who would
Enter Input : have dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the
Enter Input : street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as
Enter Input : before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head
Enter Input : felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his
Enter Input : feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and
Enter Input : did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: "that all
Enter Input : _this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would
Enter Input : not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like
Enter Input : that_." How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,
Enter Input : he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought
Enter Input : tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be
Enter Input : changed "one way or another," he repeated with desperate and immovable
Enter Input : self-confidence and determination.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay
Enter Input : Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in
Enter Input : the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very
Enter Input : sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood
Enter Input : on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a
Enter Input : mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very
Enter Input : old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and
Enter Input : coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from
Enter Input : the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five
Enter Input : copeck piece and put it in the girl's hand. She broke off abruptly on a
Enter Input : sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder "Come on,"
Enter Input : and both moved on to the next shop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you like street music?" said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged
Enter Input : man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I love to hear singing to a street organ," said Raskolnikov, and his
Enter Input : manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--"I like it
Enter Input : on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the
Enter Input : passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet
Enter Input : snow is falling straight down, when there's no wind--you know what I
Enter Input : mean?--and the street lamps shine through it..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know.... Excuse me..." muttered the stranger, frightened by the
Enter Input : question and Raskolnikov's strange manner, and he crossed over to the
Enter Input : other side of the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay
Enter Input : Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but
Enter Input : they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round
Enter Input : and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a
Enter Input : corn chandler's shop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Isn't there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All sorts of people keep booths here," answered the young man, glancing
Enter Input : superciliously at Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's his name?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What he was christened."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aren't you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously
Enter Input : forgive me, your excellency!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is that a tavern at the top there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, it's an eating-house and there's a billiard-room and you'll find
Enter Input : princesses there too.... La-la!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd
Enter Input : of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking
Enter Input : at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into
Enter Input : conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they
Enter Input : were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and
Enter Input : took a turning to the right in the direction of V.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading
Enter Input : from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn
Enter Input : to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might
Enter Input : feel more so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great
Enter Input : block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;
Enter Input : women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their
Enter Input : indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,
Enter Input : especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in
Enter Input : the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the
Enter Input : tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.
Enter Input : A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the
Enter Input : steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken
Enter Input : soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,
Enter Input : swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had
Enter Input : forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead
Enter Input : drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of
Enter Input : women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore
Enter Input : cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some
Enter Input : not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and
Enter Input : uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing
Enter Input : frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar
Enter Input : and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,
Enter Input : gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping
Enter Input : inquisitively in from the pavement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :   "Oh, my handsome soldier
Enter Input :    Don't beat me for nothing,"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to
Enter Input : make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Shall I go in?" he thought. "They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get
Enter Input : drunk?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Won't you come in?" one of the women asked him. Her voice was
Enter Input : still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not
Enter Input : repulsive--the only one of the group.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, she's pretty," he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're very nice looking yourself," she said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Isn't he thin though!" observed another woman in a deep bass. "Have you
Enter Input : just come out of a hospital?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They're all generals' daughters, it seems, but they have all snub
Enter Input : noses," interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing
Enter Input : a loose coat. "See how jolly they are."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go along with you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll go, sweetie!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, sir," the girl shouted after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She hesitated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but
Enter Input : now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there's a nice young
Enter Input : man!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's your name?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ask for Duclida."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, that's too much," one of the women observed, shaking her head
Enter Input : at Duclida. "I don't know how you can ask like that. I believe I should
Enter Input : drop with shame...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench
Enter Input : of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made
Enter Input : her criticism quietly and earnestly. "Where is it," thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : "Where is it I've read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,
Enter Input : an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,
Enter Input : on such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean,
Enter Input : everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around
Enter Input : him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his
Enter Input : life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die
Enter Input : at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...
Enter Input : How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile
Enter Input : is he who calls him vile for that," he added a moment later.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went into another street. "Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin
Enter Input : was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it
Enter Input : I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he'd read it in the
Enter Input : papers. Have you the papers?" he asked, going into a very spacious and
Enter Input : positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,
Enter Input : however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a
Enter Input : room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that
Enter Input : distance. "What if it is?" he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Will you have vodka?" asked the waiter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last
Enter Input : five days, and I'll give you something."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, sir, here's to-day's. No vodka?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and
Enter Input : began to look through them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a
Enter Input : staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire
Enter Input : in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the
Enter Input : Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....
Enter Input : Ah, here it is!" He found at last what he was seeking and began to
Enter Input : read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began
Enter Input : eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands
Enter Input : shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone
Enter Input : sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk
Enter Input : Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the
Enter Input : watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the
Enter Input : smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good
Enter Input : humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark
Enter Input : face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, you here?" he began in surprise, speaking as though he'd known
Enter Input : him all his life. "Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were
Enter Input : unconscious. How strange! And do you know I've been to see you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and
Enter Input : turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of
Enter Input : irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know you have," he answered. "I've heard it. You looked for my
Enter Input : sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says
Enter Input : you've been with him to Luise Ivanovna's--you know, the woman you tried
Enter Input : to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he
Enter Input : would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to
Enter Input : understand--it was quite clear, wasn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a hot head he is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The explosive one?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, your friend Razumihin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most
Enter Input : agreeable places. Who's been pouring champagne into you just now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We've just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring
Enter Input : it into me!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "By way of a fee! You profit by everything!" Raskolnikov laughed, "it's
Enter Input : all right, my dear boy," he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. "I
Enter Input : am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that
Enter Input : workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of
Enter Input : the old woman...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you know about it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps I know more about it than you do."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You
Enter Input : oughtn't to have come out."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, do I seem strange to you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's a lot about the fires."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I am not reading about the fires." Here he looked mysteriously at
Enter Input : Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. "No, I am not
Enter Input : reading about the fires," he went on, winking at Zametov. "But confess
Enter Input : now, my dear fellow, you're awfully anxious to know what I am reading
Enter Input : about?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not in the least. Mayn't I ask a question? Why do you keep
Enter Input : on...?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, you are a man of culture and education?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium," said Zametov with some
Enter Input : dignity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you
Enter Input : are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!" Here Raskolnikov
Enter Input : broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov's face. The latter drew
Enter Input : back, more amazed than offended.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo! how strange you are!" Zametov repeated very seriously. "I can't
Enter Input : help thinking you are still delirious."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You
Enter Input : find me curious, do you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, curious."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See
Enter Input : what a lot of papers I've made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what is it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You prick up your ears?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you mean--'prick up my ears'?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,
Enter Input : better 'I confess'... No, that's not right either; 'I make a deposition
Enter Input : and you take it.' I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and
Enter Input : searching...." he screwed up his eyes and paused. "I was searching--and
Enter Input : came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old
Enter Input : pawnbroker woman," he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing
Enter Input : his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him
Enter Input : steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov
Enter Input : afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for
Enter Input : exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What if you have been reading about it?" he cried at last, perplexed
Enter Input : and impatient. "That's no business of mine! What of it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The same old woman," Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not
Enter Input : heeding Zametov's explanation, "about whom you were talking in the
Enter Input : police-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand
Enter Input : now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean? Understand... what?" Zametov brought out, almost
Enter Input : alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he
Enter Input : suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though
Enter Input : utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with
Enter Input : extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that
Enter Input : moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch
Enter Input : trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden
Enter Input : desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at
Enter Input : them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are either mad, or..." began Zametov, and he broke off, as though
Enter Input : stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing," said Zametov, getting angry, "it's all nonsense!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became
Enter Input : suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and
Enter Input : leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten
Enter Input : Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why don't you drink your tea? It's getting cold," said Zametov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! Tea? Oh, yes...." Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of
Enter Input : bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember
Enter Input : everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face
Enter Input : resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There have been a great many of these crimes lately," said Zametov.
Enter Input : "Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of
Enter Input : false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They
Enter Input : used to forge tickets!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov answered calmly. "So you consider them criminals?" he added,
Enter Input : smiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course they are criminals."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred
Enter Input : people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too
Enter Input : many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in
Enter Input : themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
Enter Input : Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what
Enter Input : a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these
Enter Input : simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the
Enter Input : rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his
Enter Input : life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change
Enter Input : the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand
Enter Input : roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,
Enter Input : but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the
Enter Input : money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And
Enter Input : the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That his hands trembled?" observed Zametov, "yes, that's quite
Enter Input : possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can't
Enter Input : stand things."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Can't stand that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn't. For the sake of a hundred
Enter Input : roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes
Enter Input : into a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I
Enter Input : should not have the face to do it. Would you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had an intense desire again "to put his tongue out." Shivers
Enter Input : kept running down his spine.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should do it quite differently," Raskolnikov began. "This is how I
Enter Input : would change the notes: I'd count the first thousand three or four times
Enter Input : backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I'd set to the
Enter Input : second thousand; I'd count that half-way through and then hold some
Enter Input : fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light
Enter Input : again--to see whether it was a good one. 'I am afraid,' I would say, 'a
Enter Input : relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a
Enter Input : false note,' and then I'd tell them the whole story. And after I began
Enter Input : counting the third, 'No, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made a
Enter Input : mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.'
Enter Input : And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
Enter Input : so on to the end. And when I had finished, I'd pick out one from the
Enter Input : fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light
Enter Input : and ask again, 'Change them, please,' and put the clerk into such a stew
Enter Input : that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I'd finished and had
Enter Input : gone out, I'd come back, 'No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.
Enter Input : That's how I'd do it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo! what terrible things you say!" said Zametov, laughing. "But all
Enter Input : that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you'd make a slip.
Enter Input : I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on
Enter Input : himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old
Enter Input : woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a
Enter Input : desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by
Enter Input : a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the
Enter Input : place, he couldn't stand it. That was clear from the..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov seemed offended.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Clear? Why don't you catch him then?" he cried, maliciously gibing at
Enter Input : Zametov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, they will catch him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You've a tough job! A
Enter Input : great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had
Enter Input : no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any
Enter Input : child can mislead you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The fact is they always do that, though," answered Zametov. "A man will
Enter Input : commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes
Enter Input : drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all
Enter Input : as cunning as you are. You wouldn't go to a tavern, of course?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should
Enter Input : behave in that case, too?" he asked with displeasure.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should like to," Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too
Enter Input : much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very much?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very much!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All right then. This is how I should behave," Raskolnikov began, again
Enter Input : bringing his face close to Zametov's, again staring at him and speaking
Enter Input : in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. "This is what
Enter Input : I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should
Enter Input : have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place
Enter Input : with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden
Enter Input : or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone
Enter Input : weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from
Enter Input : the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure
Enter Input : to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that
Enter Input : hole. Then I'd roll the stone back so that it would look as before,
Enter Input : would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,
Enter Input : three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There'd
Enter Input : be no trace."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a madman," said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a
Enter Input : whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He
Enter Input : had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.
Enter Input : He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move
Enter Input : without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he
Enter Input : was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on
Enter Input : his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break
Enter Input : out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?" he said
Enter Input : suddenly and--realised what he had done.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His
Enter Input : face wore a contorted smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But is it possible?" he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked
Enter Input : wrathfully at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now," Zametov cried
Enter Input : hastily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you
Enter Input : believe less than ever?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not at all," cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. "Have you been
Enter Input : frightening me so as to lead up to this?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't believe it then? What were you talking about behind my
Enter Input : back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive
Enter Input : lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there," he shouted to the
Enter Input : waiter, getting up and taking his cap, "how much?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thirty copecks," the latter replied, running up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!" he
Enter Input : held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. "Red notes and
Enter Input : blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new
Enter Input : clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You've cross-examined my
Enter Input : landlady, I'll be bound.... Well, that's enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we
Enter Input : meet again!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical
Enter Input : sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he
Enter Input : was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.
Enter Input : His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation
Enter Input : stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as
Enter Input : quickly when the stimulus was removed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in
Enter Input : thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on
Enter Input : a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead," he decided.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he
Enter Input : stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other
Enter Input : till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood
Enter Input : looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then
Enter Input : anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So here you are!" he shouted at the top of his voice--"you ran away
Enter Input : from your bed! And here I've been looking for you under the sofa! We
Enter Input : went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here
Enter Input : he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole
Enter Input : truth! Confess! Do you hear?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov answered calmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a
Enter Input : sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing
Enter Input : in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me go!" said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much
Enter Input : for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I'll do
Enter Input : with you directly? I'll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you
Enter Input : home under my arm and lock you up!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, Razumihin," Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--"can't
Enter Input : you see that I don't want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to
Enter Input : shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in
Enter Input : fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I
Enter Input : was very glad to die. Didn't I tell you plainly enough to-day that
Enter Input : you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to
Enter Input : torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my
Enter Input : recovery, because it's continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov
Enter Input : went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for
Enter Input : goodness' sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don't
Enter Input : you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can
Enter Input : I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be
Enter Input : ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God's sake, let me be!
Enter Input : Let me be, let me be!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was
Enter Input : about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had
Enter Input : been with Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, go to hell then," he said gently and thoughtfully. "Stay," he
Enter Input : roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. "Listen to me. Let me tell
Enter Input : you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you've any
Enter Input : little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are
Enter Input : plagiarists even in that! There isn't a sign of independent life in
Enter Input : you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you've lymph in your veins
Enter Input : instead of blood. I don't believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances
Enter Input : the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!" he
Enter Input : cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making
Enter Input : a movement--"hear me out! You know I'm having a house-warming this
Enter Input : evening, I dare say they've arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I
Enter Input : just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren't a fool, a common
Enter Input : fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...
Enter Input : you see, Rodya, I recognise you're a clever fellow, but you're a
Enter Input : fool!--and if you weren't a fool you'd come round to me this evening
Enter Input : instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone
Enter Input : out, there's no help for it! I'd give you a snug easy chair, my landlady
Enter Input : has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any
Enter Input : way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "R-rubbish!" Razumihin shouted, out of patience. "How do you know?
Enter Input : You can't answer for yourself! You don't know anything about it....
Enter Input : Thousands of times I've fought tooth and nail with people and run back
Enter Input : to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So
Enter Input : remember, Potchinkov's house on the third storey...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you'd let anybody beat you from sheer
Enter Input : benevolence."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Beat? Whom? Me? I'd twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov's
Enter Input : house, 47, Babushkin's flat...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I shall not come, Razumihin." Raskolnikov turned and walked away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I bet you will," Razumihin shouted after him. "I refuse to know you if
Enter Input : you don't! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you see him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Talked to him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What about? Confound you, don't tell me then. Potchinkov's house, 47,
Enter Input : Babushkin's flat, remember!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.
Enter Input : Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he
Enter Input : went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Confound it," he went on almost aloud. "He talked sensibly but yet...
Enter Input : I am a fool! As if madmen didn't talk sensibly! And this was just what
Enter Input : Zossimov seemed afraid of." He struck his finger on his forehead. "What
Enter Input : if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,
Enter Input : what a blunder! I can't." And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but
Enter Input : there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to
Enter Input : the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and
Enter Input : leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting
Enter Input : with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this
Enter Input : place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending
Enter Input : over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the
Enter Input : sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at
Enter Input : one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in
Enter Input : the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,
Enter Input : and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed
Enter Input : before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal
Enter Input : banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,
Enter Input : saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He
Enter Input : became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked
Enter Input : and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,
Enter Input : wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but
Enter Input : obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her
Enter Input : right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then
Enter Input : her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and
Enter Input : swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning
Enter Input : woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head
Enter Input : and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A woman drowning! A woman drowning!" shouted dozens of voices; people
Enter Input : ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people
Enter Input : crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mercy on it! it's our Afrosinya!" a woman cried tearfully close by.
Enter Input : "Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A boat, a boat" was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a
Enter Input : boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great
Enter Input : coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:
Enter Input : she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of
Enter Input : her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a
Enter Input : comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They
Enter Input : laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered
Enter Input : consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,
Enter Input : stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's drunk herself out of her senses," the same woman's voice wailed
Enter Input : at her side. "Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang
Enter Input : herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little
Enter Input : girl to look after her--and here she's in trouble again! A neighbour,
Enter Input : gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,
Enter Input : see yonder...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone
Enter Input : mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange
Enter Input : sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. "No, that's
Enter Input : loathsome... water... it's not good enough," he muttered to himself.
Enter Input : "Nothing will come of it," he added, "no use to wait. What about the
Enter Input : police office...? And why isn't Zametov at the police office? The police
Enter Input : office is open till ten o'clock...." He turned his back to the railing
Enter Input : and looked about him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well then!" he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and
Enter Input : walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and
Enter Input : empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there
Enter Input : was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out "to make an
Enter Input : end of it all." Complete apathy had succeeded to it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlessly
Enter Input : along the canal bank. "Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to.... But
Enter Input : is it a way out? What does it matter! There'll be the square yard of
Enter Input : space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or
Enter Input : not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie
Enter Input : down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don't
Enter Input : care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one's head."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the
Enter Input : second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the
Enter Input : first turning he stopped and, after a minute's thought, turned into a
Enter Input : side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any
Enter Input : object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking
Enter Input : at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted
Enter Input : his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
Enter Input : He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.
Enter Input : An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the
Enter Input : house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the
Enter Input : right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
Enter Input : The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing
Enter Input : and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework
Enter Input : of the window had been taken out. "That wasn't so then," he thought.
Enter Input : Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been
Enter Input : working. "It's shut up and the door newly painted. So it's to let." Then
Enter Input : the third storey and the fourth. "Here!" He was perplexed to find the
Enter Input : door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;
Enter Input : he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last
Enter Input : stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were
Enter Input : workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he
Enter Input : would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the
Enter Input : same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed
Enter Input : strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There
Enter Input : were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the
Enter Input : other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with
Enter Input : lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for
Enter Input : some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper
Enter Input : with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.
Enter Input : The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were
Enter Input : hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took
Enter Input : no notice of Raskolnikov's coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : folded his arms and listened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She comes to me in the morning," said the elder to the younger, "very
Enter Input : early, all dressed up. 'Why are you preening and prinking?' says I. 'I
Enter Input : am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!' That's a way of
Enter Input : going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what is a fashion book?" the younger one asked. He obviously
Enter Input : regarded the other as an authority.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the
Enter Input : tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how
Enter Input : to dress, the male sex as well as the female. They're pictures. The
Enter Input : gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies' fluffles,
Enter Input : they're beyond anything you can fancy."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg," the younger cried
Enter Input : enthusiastically, "except father and mother, there's everything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Except them, there's everything to be found, my boy," the elder
Enter Input : declared sententiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,
Enter Input : the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very
Enter Input : tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the
Enter Input : corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and
Enter Input : went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want?" he asked suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the
Enter Input : bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and
Enter Input : a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly
Enter Input : fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more
Enter Input : vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more
Enter Input : satisfaction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what do you want? Who are you?" the workman shouted, going out to
Enter Input : him. Raskolnikov went inside again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I want to take a flat," he said. "I am looking round."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up
Enter Input : with the porter."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The floors have been washed, will they be painted?" Raskolnikov went
Enter Input : on. "Is there no blood?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What blood?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a
Enter Input : perfect pool there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But who are you?" the workman cried, uneasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who am I?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You want to know? Come to the police station, I'll tell you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The workmen looked at him in amazement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock
Enter Input : up," said the elder workman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well, come along," said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going
Enter Input : out first, he went slowly downstairs. "Hey, porter," he cried in the
Enter Input : gateway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;
Enter Input : the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went straight up to them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want?" asked one of the porters.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you been to the police office?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've just been there. What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it open?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is the assistant there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He was there for a time. What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's been to look at the flat," said the elder workman, coming forward.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Which flat?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where we are at work. 'Why have you washed away the blood?' says he.
Enter Input : 'There has been a murder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it.'
Enter Input : And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. 'Come to the police
Enter Input : station,' says he. 'I'll tell you everything there.' He wouldn't leave
Enter Input : us."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who are you?" he shouted as impressively as he could.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in
Enter Input : Shil's house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he
Enter Input : knows me." Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not
Enter Input : turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why have you been to the flat?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To look at it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is there to look at?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Take him straight to the police station," the man in the long coat
Enter Input : jerked in abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the
Enter Input : same slow, lazy tones:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come along."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, take him," the man went on more confidently. "Why was he going
Enter Input : into _that_, what's in his mind, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's not drunk, but God knows what's the matter with him," muttered the
Enter Input : workman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what do you want?" the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry
Enter Input : in earnest--"Why are you hanging about?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You funk the police station then?" said Raskolnikov jeeringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How funk it? Why are you hanging about?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's a rogue!" shouted the peasant woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why waste time talking to him?" cried the other porter, a huge peasant
Enter Input : in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. "Get along! He is a rogue
Enter Input : and no mistake. Get along!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He
Enter Input : lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in
Enter Input : silence and walked away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Strange man!" observed the workman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are strange folks about nowadays," said the woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You should have taken him to the police station all the same," said the
Enter Input : man in the long coat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Better have nothing to do with him," decided the big porter. "A regular
Enter Input : rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you
Enter Input : won't get rid of him.... We know the sort!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Shall I go there or not?" thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle
Enter Input : of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as
Enter Input : though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all
Enter Input : was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to
Enter Input : him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards
Enter Input : away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
Enter Input : In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the
Enter Input : middle of the street. "What is it?" Raskolnikov turned to the right
Enter Input : and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled
Enter Input : coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to
Enter Input : the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VII
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of
Enter Input : spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got
Enter Input : off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....
Enter Input : A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One
Enter Input : of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying
Enter Input : close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the
Enter Input : coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last
Enter Input : in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a
Enter Input : man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with
Enter Input : blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was
Enter Input : flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and
Enter Input : disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Merciful heaven!" wailed the coachman, "what more could I do? If I'd
Enter Input : been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,
Enter Input : not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody
Enter Input : else. A drunken man can't walk straight, we all know.... I saw him
Enter Input : crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again
Enter Input : and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell
Enter Input : straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very
Enter Input : tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,
Enter Input : he screamed... that made them worse. That's how it happened!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just how it was," a voice in the crowd confirmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He shouted, that's true, he shouted three times," another voice
Enter Input : declared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Three times it was, we all heard it," shouted a third.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was
Enter Input : evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who
Enter Input : was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little
Enter Input : anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to
Enter Input : take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew
Enter Input : his name.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The
Enter Input : lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face. He recognised
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know him! I know him!" he shouted, pushing to the front. "It's a
Enter Input : government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close
Enter Input : by in Kozel's house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?" He
Enter Input : pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in
Enter Input : violent agitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it
Enter Input : had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious
Enter Input : Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Just here, three houses away," he said eagerly, "the house belongs to
Enter Input : Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,
Enter Input : he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one
Enter Input : daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is
Enter Input : sure to be a doctor in the house. I'll pay, I'll pay! At least he will
Enter Input : be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he'll die
Enter Input : before you get him to the hospital." He managed to slip something
Enter Input : unseen into the policeman's hand. But the thing was straightforward
Enter Input : and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the
Enter Input : injured man; people volunteered to help.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kozel's house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,
Enter Input : carefully holding Marmeladov's head and showing the way.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn
Enter Input : round! I'll pay, I'll make it worth your while," he muttered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free
Enter Input : moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and
Enter Input : back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself
Enter Input : and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest
Enter Input : girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not
Enter Input : understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so
Enter Input : always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost
Enter Input : to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little
Enter Input : brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was
Enter Input : waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.
Enter Input : He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,
Enter Input : serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels
Enter Input : together and toes turned out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting
Enter Input : perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good
Enter Input : little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little
Enter Input : girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,
Enter Input : waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve
Enter Input : them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the
Enter Input : other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,
Enter Input : consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner
Enter Input : during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than
Enter Input : ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You wouldn't believe, you can't imagine, Polenka," she said, walking
Enter Input : about the room, "what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa's house
Enter Input : and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!
Enter Input : Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that
Enter Input : everyone who came to see him said, 'We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,
Enter Input : as our governor!' When I... when..." she coughed violently, "oh, cursed
Enter Input : life," she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her
Enter Input : breast, "when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal's...
Enter Input : Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father
Enter Input : and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once 'Isn't that the pretty
Enter Input : girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?' (You must mend
Enter Input : that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or
Enter Input : to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger," she
Enter Input : articulated with effort.) "Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just
Enter Input : come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to
Enter Input : make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions
Enter Input : and told him that my heart had long been another's. That other was your
Enter Input : father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me
Enter Input : the shirt, and the stockings! Lida," said she to the youngest one, "you
Enter Input : must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out
Enter Input : with it... I'll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond
Enter Input : doesn't come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,
Enter Input : he has torn it to rags! I'd do it all together, so as not to have to
Enter Input : work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!
Enter Input : What's this?" she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,
Enter Input : who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. "What is it? What are
Enter Input : they bringing? Mercy on us!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are we to put him?" asked the policeman, looking round when
Enter Input : Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov showed him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Run over in the road! Drunk!" someone shouted in the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The
Enter Input : children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and
Enter Input : clutched at her, trembling all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "For God's sake be calm, don't be frightened!" he said, speaking
Enter Input : quickly, "he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don't
Enter Input : be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I've been
Enter Input : here already, you remember? He will come to; I'll pay!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's done it this time!" Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she
Enter Input : rushed to her husband.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who
Enter Input : swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man's head a
Enter Input : pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining
Enter Input : him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips
Enter Input : and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a
Enter Input : doctor, it appeared, next door but one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've sent for a doctor," he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, "don't be
Enter Input : uneasy, I'll pay. Haven't you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,
Enter Input : anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe
Enter Input : me.... We shall see what the doctor says!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the
Enter Input : corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in
Enter Input : readiness for washing her children's and husband's linen that night.
Enter Input : This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a
Enter Input : week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they
Enter Input : were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could
Enter Input : not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she
Enter Input : preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when
Enter Input : the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry
Enter Input : by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request,
Enter Input : but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already
Enter Input : succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off
Enter Input : Marmeladov's face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands
Enter Input : to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began
Enter Input : to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man
Enter Input : brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Polenka," cried Katerina Ivanovna, "run to Sonia, make haste. If you
Enter Input : don't find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over
Enter Input : and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!
Enter Input : there, put on the shawl."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Run your fastest!" cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after
Enter Input : which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his
Enter Input : heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn't have
Enter Input : dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a
Enter Input : time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost
Enter Input : all Madame Lippevechsel's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms
Enter Input : of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but
Enter Input : afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a
Enter Input : fury.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You might let him die in peace, at least," she shouted at the crowd,
Enter Input : "is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,
Enter Input : cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his
Enter Input : hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They
Enter Input : evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after
Enter Input : another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling
Enter Input : of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden
Enter Input : accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which
Enter Input : no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and
Enter Input : compassion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying
Enter Input : that they'd no business to make a disturbance here.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No business to die!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to
Enter Input : the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to
Enter Input : face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident
Enter Input : and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and
Enter Input : irresponsible German.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, my God!" she cried, clasping her hands, "your husband drunken
Enter Input : horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,"
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with
Enter Input : the landlady that she might "remember her place" and even now could not
Enter Input : deny herself this satisfaction). "Amalia Ludwigovna..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may
Enter Input : not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not
Enter Input : one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who's laughing
Enter Input : behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of 'they are at it
Enter Input : again' was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you
Enter Input : Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that
Enter Input : name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;
Enter Input : he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
Enter Input : Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,
Enter Input : himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew
Enter Input : me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been
Enter Input : a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many
Enter Input : friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable
Enter Input : pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has
Enter Input : wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a
Enter Input : child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,
Enter Input : but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna's eloquence. At that
Enter Input : instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she
Enter Input : ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or
Enter Input : understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew
Enter Input : deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth
Enter Input : and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked
Enter Input : at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding," she said
Enter Input : in despair. "We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon
Enter Input : Zaharovitch, if you can," she cried to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov recognised her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A priest," he articulated huskily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window
Enter Input : frame and exclaimed in despair:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, cursed life!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A priest," the dying man said again after a moment's silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They've gone for him," Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her
Enter Input : shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she
Enter Input : returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for
Enter Input : long.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in
Enter Input : the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her
Enter Input : wondering childish eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ah," he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What now?" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Barefoot, barefoot!" he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the
Enter Input : child's bare feet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Be silent," Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, "you know why she is
Enter Input : barefooted."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank God, the doctor," exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about
Enter Input : him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully
Enter Input : felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the
Enter Input : blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's chest. It was gashed,
Enter Input : crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.
Enter Input : On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking
Enter Input : yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse's hoof. The doctor
Enter Input : frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and
Enter Input : turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's wonderful that he has recovered consciousness," the doctor
Enter Input : whispered softly to Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you think of him?" he asked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He will die immediately."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is there really no hope?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,
Enter Input : too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.
Enter Input : He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Better bleed him then."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,
Enter Input : and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing
Enter Input : the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
Enter Input : The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his
Enter Input : shoulders and remained.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably
Enter Input : understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt
Enter Input : down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of
Enter Input : her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his
Enter Input : little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with
Enter Input : precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which
Enter Input : seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her
Enter Input : lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling
Enter Input : straight the boy's shirt, and managed to cover the girl's bare shoulders
Enter Input : with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her
Enter Input : knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was
Enter Input : opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from
Enter Input : all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not
Enter Input : venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She
Enter Input : came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for
Enter Input : her mother, went up to her and said, "She's coming, I met her in the
Enter Input : street." Her mother made her kneel beside her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,
Enter Input : and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,
Enter Input : death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of
Enter Input : the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,
Enter Input : unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the
Enter Input : doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.
Enter Input : She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with
Enter Input : its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the
Enter Input : whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought
Enter Input : with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat
Enter Input : with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat
Enter Input : was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in
Enter Input : terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather
Enter Input : pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the
Enter Input : priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some
Enter Input : words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a
Enter Input : step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.
Enter Input : The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and
Enter Input : consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What am I to do with these?" she interrupted sharply and irritably,
Enter Input : pointing to the little ones.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour," the priest began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach! He is merciful, but not to us."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's a sin, a sin, madam," observed the priest, shaking his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And isn't that a sin?" cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying
Enter Input : man.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to
Enter Input : compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't understand!" cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.
Enter Input : "And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself
Enter Input : under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.
Enter Input : He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he
Enter Input : wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he's dying! One
Enter Input : less to keep!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a sin, madam, such
Enter Input : feelings are a great sin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,
Enter Input : wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,
Enter Input : and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now
Enter Input : she flew at him almost in a frenzy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, father! That's words and only words! Forgive! If he'd not been run
Enter Input : over, he'd have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and
Enter Input : in rags and he'd have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been
Enter Input : sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children's
Enter Input : and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I
Enter Input : should have been darning them. That's how I spend my nights!... What's
Enter Input : the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief
Enter Input : to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her
Enter Input : aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed
Enter Input : his head and said nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face
Enter Input : of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying
Enter Input : to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and
Enter Input : articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he
Enter Input : wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!" And the sick man
Enter Input : was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the
Enter Input : doorway and he saw Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a
Enter Input : corner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who's that? Who's that?" he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,
Enter Input : in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his
Enter Input : daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lie down! Lie do-own!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his
Enter Input : elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as
Enter Input : though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.
Enter Input : Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and
Enter Input : gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying
Enter Input : father. His face showed intense suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!" he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand
Enter Input : to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on
Enter Input : the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he
Enter Input : was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so
Enter Input : without moving. He died in her arms.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's got what he wanted," Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband's
Enter Input : dead body. "Well, what's to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can
Enter Input : I give them to-morrow to eat?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Katerina Ivanovna," he began, "last week your husband told me all his
Enter Input : life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate
Enter Input : reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you
Enter Input : all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became
Enter Input : friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my
Enter Input : dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any
Enter Input : assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will
Enter Input : be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....
Enter Input : Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd
Enter Input : to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim
Enter Input : Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions
Enter Input : in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but
Enter Input : Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, is that you?" he asked him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's dead," answered Raskolnikov. "The doctor and the priest have been,
Enter Input : all as it should have been. Don't worry the poor woman too much, she is
Enter Input : in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a
Enter Input : kind-hearted man, I know..." he added with a smile, looking straight in
Enter Input : his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you are spattered with blood," observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing
Enter Input : in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... I'm covered with blood," Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;
Enter Input : then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious
Enter Input : of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and
Enter Input : strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be
Enter Input : compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been
Enter Input : pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on
Enter Input : his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting
Enter Input : with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid
Enter Input : footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was
Enter Input : running after him, calling "Wait! wait!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped
Enter Input : short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : could distinguish the child's thin but pretty little face, looking at
Enter Input : him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message
Enter Input : which she was evidently glad to give.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?" she said
Enter Input : hurriedly in a breathless voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of
Enter Input : rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said
Enter Input : why.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who sent you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sister Sonia sent me," answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew it was sister Sonia sent you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,
Enter Input : too, and said 'Run fast, Polenka.'"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you love sister Sonia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I love her more than anyone," Polenka answered with a peculiar
Enter Input : earnestness, and her smile became graver.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And will you love me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : By way of answer he saw the little girl's face approaching him, her full
Enter Input : lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks
Enter Input : held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl
Enter Input : wept softly, pressing her face against him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am sorry for father," she said a moment later, raising her
Enter Input : tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. "It's
Enter Input : nothing but misfortunes now," she added suddenly with that peculiarly
Enter Input : sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak
Enter Input : like grown-up people.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did your father love you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He loved Lida most," she went on very seriously without a smile,
Enter Input : exactly like grown-up people, "he loved her because she is little and
Enter Input : because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But
Enter Input : he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too," she added with
Enter Input : dignity. "And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she
Enter Input : liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,
Enter Input : for it's time my education began."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And do you know your prayers?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself
Enter Input : as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.
Enter Input : First they repeat the 'Ave Maria' and then another prayer: 'Lord,
Enter Input : forgive and bless sister Sonia,' and then another, 'Lord, forgive and
Enter Input : bless our second father.' For our elder father is dead and this is
Enter Input : another one, but we do pray for the other as well."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. 'And Thy
Enter Input : servant Rodion,' nothing more."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll pray for you all the rest of my life," the little girl declared
Enter Input : hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him
Enter Input : warmly once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to
Enter Input : come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past
Enter Input : ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on
Enter Input : the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Enough," he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. "I've done with
Enter Input : fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven't I lived
Enter Input : just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of
Enter Input : Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the
Enter Input : reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now
Enter Input : we will see! We will try our strength!" he added defiantly, as though
Enter Input : challenging some power of darkness. "And I was ready to consent to live
Enter Input : in a square of space!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.
Enter Input : I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov's house
Enter Input : is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if
Enter Input : it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some
Enter Input : satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you
Enter Input : can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that's
Enter Input : what they don't know," he added proudly and self-confidently and
Enter Input : he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and
Enter Input : self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming
Enter Input : a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this
Enter Input : revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a
Enter Input : straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, 'could live, that there was still
Enter Input : life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.' Perhaps he
Enter Input : was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of
Enter Input : that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I did ask her to remember 'Thy servant Rodion' in her prayers," the
Enter Input : idea struck him. "Well, that was... in case of emergency," he added and
Enter Input : laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at
Enter Input : Potchinkov's and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way
Enter Input : upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big
Enter Input : gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could
Enter Input : hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin's room was fairly large; the
Enter Input : company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,
Enter Input : where two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with two
Enter Input : samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up
Enter Input : from the landlady's kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran
Enter Input : out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a
Enter Input : great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite
Enter Input : drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen," Raskolnikov hastened to say, "I've only just come to tell you
Enter Input : you've won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to
Enter Input : him. I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And
Enter Input : so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know what? I'll see you home. If you say you're weak yourself,
Enter Input : you must..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped
Enter Input : out?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle's, I expect, or perhaps
Enter Input : he has come without being invited... I'll leave uncle with them, he
Enter Input : is an invaluable person, pity I can't introduce you to him now. But
Enter Input : confound them all now! They won't notice me, and I need a little fresh
Enter Input : air, for you've come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I
Enter Input : should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...
Enter Input : you simply can't imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn't you
Enter Input : imagine? Don't we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that's the
Enter Input : way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special
Enter Input : interest in him; soon his face brightened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You must go to bed at once," he pronounced, examining the patient as
Enter Input : far as he could, "and take something for the night. Will you take it? I
Enter Input : got it ready some time ago... a powder."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Two, if you like," answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a good thing you are taking him home," observed Zossimov to
Enter Input : Razumihin--"we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he's not at all
Enter Input : amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?"
Enter Input : Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. "I won't tell
Enter Input : you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me
Enter Input : to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and
Enter Input : afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's got a notion in his head
Enter Input : that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,
Enter Input : you've three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,
Enter Input : you needn't care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,
Enter Input : that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental
Enter Input : diseases, and what's brought him to this conclusion about you was your
Enter Input : conversation to-day with Zametov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Zametov told you all about it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does
Enter Input : Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little
Enter Input : drunk now.... But that's... no matter... the point is that this
Enter Input : idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you
Enter Input : understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea
Enter Input : is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that
Enter Input : bubble's burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave
Enter Input : Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that's between ourselves,
Enter Input : brother; please don't let out a hint that you know of it; I've noticed
Enter Input : he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's. But to-day, to-day
Enter Input : it's all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He
Enter Input : took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed
Enter Input : of it himself now; I know that..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too
Enter Input : freely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint," said
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No need to explain that! And it wasn't the paint only: the fever had
Enter Input : been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed
Enter Input : that boy is now, you wouldn't believe! 'I am not worth his little
Enter Input : finger,' he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,
Enter Input : brother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais
Enter Input : de Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,
Enter Input : you know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced
Enter Input : him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you
Enter Input : suddenly--put out your tongue at him: 'There now, what do you make of
Enter Input : it?' It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by
Enter Input : Jove, it's what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn't there! He was hoping to
Enter Input : see you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,
Enter Input : you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it's
Enter Input : clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and
Enter Input : how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little
Enter Input : drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I
Enter Input : tell you, he's mad on mental diseases. But don't you mind him..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For half a minute both were silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, Razumihin," began Raskolnikov, "I want to tell you plainly:
Enter Input : I've just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my
Enter Input : money... and besides I've just been kissed by someone who, if I had
Enter Input : killed anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else
Enter Input : there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I
Enter Input : am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter? What's the matter with you?" Razumihin asked
Enter Input : anxiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am so sad, so sad...
Enter Input : like a woman. Look, what's that? Look, look!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level
Enter Input : of the landlady's door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that
Enter Input : there was a light in Raskolnikov's garret.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Queer! Nastasya, perhaps," observed Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,
Enter Input : but... I don't care! Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean? I am coming with you, we'll come in together!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say
Enter Input : good-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter with you, Rodya?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing... come along... you shall be witness."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that
Enter Input : perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. "Ah, I've upset him with my
Enter Input : chatter!" he muttered to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When they reached the door they heard voices in the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the
Enter Input : door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an
Enter Input : hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of
Enter Input : them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would
Enter Input : arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had
Enter Input : spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was
Enter Input : standing before them and had told them everything by now. They were
Enter Input : beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his "running away"
Enter Input : to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! "Good
Enter Input : Heavens, what had become of him?" Both had been weeping, both had been
Enter Input : in anguish for that hour and a half.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov's entrance. Both rushed to
Enter Input : him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck
Enter Input : him like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he
Enter Input : could not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,
Enter Input : laughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,
Enter Input : fainting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the
Enter Input : doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and
Enter Input : in a moment had him on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's nothing, nothing!" he cried to the mother and sister--"it's only a
Enter Input : faint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,
Enter Input : that he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is
Enter Input : all right again!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made
Enter Input : her bend down to see that "he is all right again." The mother and sister
Enter Input : looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They
Enter Input : had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya
Enter Input : during his illness, by this "very competent young man," as Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with
Enter Input : Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : PART III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly
Enter Input : to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations
Enter Input : he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand
Enter Input : and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
Enter Input : His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion
Enter Input : agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost
Enter Input : insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go home... with him," he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,
Enter Input : "good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you
Enter Input : arrived?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This evening, Rodya," answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "the train was
Enter Input : awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I
Enter Input : will spend the night here, near you..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't torture me!" he said with a gesture of irritation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will stay with him," cried Razumihin, "I won't leave him for a
Enter Input : moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts' content!
Enter Input : My uncle is presiding there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How, how can I thank you!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once
Enter Input : more pressing Razumihin's hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't have it! I can't have it!" he repeated irritably, "don't worry
Enter Input : me! Enough, go away... I can't stand it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute," Dounia
Enter Input : whispered in dismay; "we are distressing him, that's evident."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mayn't I look at him after three years?" wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay," he stopped them again, "you keep interrupting me, and my ideas
Enter Input : get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,
Enter Input : that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today," Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I'd throw him
Enter Input : downstairs and told him to go to hell...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don't mean to tell us..."
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at
Enter Input : Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting
Enter Input : for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from
Enter Input : Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,
Enter Input : and were in painful perplexity and suspense.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia," Raskolnikov continued with an effort, "I don't want that
Enter Input : marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,
Enter Input : so that we may never hear his name again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good Heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Brother, think what you are saying!" Avdotya Romanovna began
Enter Input : impetuously, but immediately checked herself. "You are not fit to talk
Enter Input : now, perhaps; you are tired," she added gently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_
Enter Input : sake. But I won't accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before
Enter Input : to-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will
Enter Input : be the end of it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That I can't do!" the girl cried, offended, "what right have you..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don't you see..."
Enter Input : the mother interposed in dismay. "Better come away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is raving," Razumihin cried tipsily, "or how would he dare!
Enter Input : To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did
Enter Input : drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made
Enter Input : speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out
Enter Input : crest-fallen...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then it's true?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye till to-morrow, brother," said Dounia compassionately--"let us
Enter Input : go, mother... Good-bye, Rodya."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you hear, sister," he repeated after them, making a last effort,
Enter Input : "I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like
Enter Input : a scoundrel, but you mustn't... one is enough... and though I am a
Enter Input : scoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister. It's me or Luzhin! Go now...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you're out of your mind! Despot!" roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov
Enter Input : did not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and
Enter Input : turned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with
Enter Input : interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively
Enter Input : started at her glance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing would induce me to go," she whispered in despair to Razumihin.
Enter Input : "I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'll spoil everything," Razumihin answered in the same whisper,
Enter Input : losing patience--"come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a
Enter Input : light! I assure you," he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--"that
Enter Input : he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you
Enter Input : understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not
Enter Input : to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once
Enter Input : and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this
Enter Input : time of night, and will do himself some mischief...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you saying?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left in those lodgings without
Enter Input : you. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : couldn't find you better lodgings... But you know I've had a little to
Enter Input : drink, and that's what makes me... swear; don't mind it...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I'll go to the landlady here," Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,
Enter Input : "I'll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I
Enter Input : can't leave him like that, I cannot!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady's
Enter Input : door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in
Enter Input : extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing
Enter Input : Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of
Enter Input : it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he
Enter Input : had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he
Enter Input : had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with
Enter Input : the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving
Enter Input : them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every
Enter Input : word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their
Enter Input : hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the
Enter Input : least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of
Enter Input : his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew
Enter Input : them all the closer to him. If they'd told him to jump head foremost
Enter Input : from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation
Enter Input : in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man
Enter Input : was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety
Enter Input : over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was
Enter Input : unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna
Enter Input : shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not
Enter Input : see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It
Enter Input : was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya's account of her
Enter Input : brother's queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from
Enter Input : him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,
Enter Input : that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,
Enter Input : however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of
Enter Input : Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might
Enter Input : be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You can't go to the landlady, that's perfect nonsense!" he cried. "If
Enter Input : you stay, though you are his mother, you'll drive him to a frenzy, and
Enter Input : then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I'll tell you what I'll
Enter Input : do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I'll conduct you both home, you
Enter Input : can't be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that
Enter Input : way.... But no matter! Then I'll run straight back here and a quarter of
Enter Input : an hour later, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news how he is,
Enter Input : whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I'll run home in
Enter Input : a twinkling--I've a lot of friends there, all drunk--I'll fetch
Enter Input : Zossimov--that's the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,
Enter Input : but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I'll drag him
Enter Input : to Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two reports in the
Enter Input : hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that's a
Enter Input : very different thing from my account of him! If there's anything wrong,
Enter Input : I swear I'll bring you here myself, but, if it's all right, you go to
Enter Input : bed. And I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he won't hear me,
Enter Input : and I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady's, to be at hand. Which
Enter Input : is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the
Enter Input : landlady is out of the question; it's all right for me, but it's out of
Enter Input : the question for you: she wouldn't take you, for she's... for she's a
Enter Input : fool... She'd be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,
Enter Input : too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an
Enter Input : absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...
Enter Input : No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let us go, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna, "he will certainly do what
Enter Input : he has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really
Enter Input : will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!"
Enter Input : Razumihin cried in ecstasy, "let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit
Enter Input : with him with a light; I'll come in a quarter of an hour."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no
Enter Input : further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down
Enter Input : the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and
Enter Input : good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in
Enter Input : such a condition....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!" Razumihin broke in upon
Enter Input : her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge
Enter Input : steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he
Enter Input : did not observe, however. "Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,
Enter Input : but that's not it; I am not drunk from wine. It's seeing you has turned
Enter Input : my head... But don't mind me! Don't take any notice: I am talking
Enter Input : nonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The
Enter Input : minute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over
Enter Input : my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only
Enter Input : you knew how I love you both! Don't laugh, and don't be angry! You may
Enter Input : be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I
Enter Input : am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year
Enter Input : there was a moment... though it wasn't a presentiment really, for
Enter Input : you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan't sleep all
Enter Input : night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...
Enter Input : that's why he mustn't be irritated."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you say?" cried the mother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did the doctor really say that?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a
Enter Input : powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been
Enter Input : better if you had come to-morrow. It's a good thing we went away. And in
Enter Input : an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not
Enter Input : drunk! And I shan't be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because
Enter Input : they got me into an argument, damn them! I've sworn never to argue! They
Enter Input : talk such trash! I almost came to blows! I've left my uncle to preside.
Enter Input : Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism
Enter Input : and that's just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike
Enter Input : themselves as they can. That's what they regard as the highest point of
Enter Input : progress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added
Enter Input : fuel to the flames.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you think?" shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, "you think I
Enter Input : am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk
Enter Input : nonsense. That's man's one privilege over all creation. Through error
Enter Input : you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any
Enter Input : truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and
Enter Input : fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even make
Enter Input : mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,
Enter Input : and I'll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one's own way is better than
Enter Input : to go right in someone else's. In the first case you are a man, in the
Enter Input : second you're no better than a bird. Truth won't escape you, but life
Enter Input : can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?
Enter Input : In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,
Enter Input : judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are
Enter Input : still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other
Enter Input : people's ideas, it's what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?" cried
Enter Input : Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies' hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, mercy, I do not know," cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes... though I don't agree with you in everything," added Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand
Enter Input : so painfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you..." he cried in
Enter Input : a transport, "you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and
Enter Input : perfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss
Enter Input : your hands here at once, on my knees..." and he fell on his knees on the
Enter Input : pavement, fortunately at that time deserted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : cried, greatly distressed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get up, get up!" said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That's it! Enough! I
Enter Input : get up and we'll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and
Enter Input : drunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do
Enter Input : homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And
Enter Input : I've done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya
Enter Input : was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how
Enter Input : dare he put you in such lodgings! It's a scandal! Do you know the
Enter Input : sort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are
Enter Input : his betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I'll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a
Enter Input : scoundrel."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting..." Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : was beginning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,"
Enter Input : Razumihin made haste to apologise. "But... but you can't be angry with
Enter Input : me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!
Enter Input : That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I'm in... hm! Well,
Enter Input : anyway, I won't say why, I daren't.... But we all saw to-day when he
Enter Input : came in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair
Enter Input : curled at the barber's, not because he was in such a hurry to show his
Enter Input : wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint
Enter Input : and a buffoon. That's evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a
Enter Input : fool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,
Enter Input : ladies?" he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, "though
Enter Input : all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we
Enter Input : do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the
Enter Input : truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...
Enter Input : is not on the right path. Though I've been calling them all sorts of
Enter Input : names just now, I do respect them all... though I don't respect Zametov,
Enter Input : I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he
Enter Input : is an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it's all said and
Enter Input : forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let's go on. I know this corridor,
Enter Input : I've been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you
Enter Input : here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.
Enter Input : Don't let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I'll come back with news,
Enter Input : and half an hour later I'll bring Zossimov, you'll see! Good-bye, I'll
Enter Input : run."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?" said Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't worry yourself, mother," said Dounia, taking off her hat and
Enter Input : cape. "God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a
Enter Input : drinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has
Enter Input : done for Rodya...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring
Enter Input : myself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied
Enter Input : our meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Tears came into her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it's not that, mother. You didn't see, you were crying all the
Enter Input : time. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that's the reason."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked
Enter Input : to you, Dounia!" said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,
Enter Input : trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia's
Enter Input : standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven
Enter Input : him. "I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow," she added,
Enter Input : probing her further.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,"
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going
Enter Input : beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
Enter Input : afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter
Enter Input : warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait
Enter Input : anxiously for Razumihin's return, timidly watching her daughter who
Enter Input : walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.
Enter Input : This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna's and the mother was always afraid to break in on her
Enter Input : daughter's mood at such moments.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation
Enter Input : for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many
Enter Input : people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and
Enter Input : fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was
Enter Input : remarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,
Enter Input : strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every
Enter Input : gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
Enter Input : softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she
Enter Input : might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a
Enter Input : little lighter than her brother's; there was a proud light in her almost
Enter Input : black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was
Enter Input : pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness
Enter Input : and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected
Enter Input : a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful
Enter Input : face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty
Enter Input : expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;
Enter Input : but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,
Enter Input : laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,
Enter Input : simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone
Enter Input : like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head
Enter Input : immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the
Enter Input : first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at
Enter Input : meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation
Enter Input : at her brother's insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was
Enter Input : sealed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken
Enter Input : talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov's eccentric
Enter Input : landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
Enter Input : forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she
Enter Input : looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the
Enter Input : case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure
Enter Input : sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to
Enter Input : preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her
Enter Input : hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow's
Enter Input : foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from
Enter Input : anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia
Enter Input : over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and
Enter Input : yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a
Enter Input : great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a
Enter Input : certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions
Enter Input : which nothing would induce her to cross.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin's departure, there came two
Enter Input : subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't come in, I haven't time," he hastened to say when the door was
Enter Input : opened. "He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may
Enter Input : sleep ten hours. Nastasya's with him; I told her not to leave till I
Enter Input : came. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you'd
Enter Input : better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he ran off down the corridor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a very competent and... devoted young man!" cried Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He seems a splendid person!" Avdotya Romanovna replied with some
Enter Input : warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor
Enter Input : and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely
Enter Input : relying on Razumihin's promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing
Enter Input : Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to
Enter Input : go to Raskolnikov's, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest
Enter Input : suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated
Enter Input : condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw
Enter Input : that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten
Enter Input : minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and
Enter Input : extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.
Enter Input : He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the
Enter Input : slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two
Enter Input : ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and
Enter Input : addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him
Enter Input : extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the
Enter Input : invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his
Enter Input : observations the patient's illness was due partly to his unfortunate
Enter Input : material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also
Enter Input : a moral origin, "was, so to speak, the product of several material and
Enter Input : moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...
Enter Input : and so on." Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his
Enter Input : words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this
Enter Input : theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna's anxiously and timidly inquiring as
Enter Input : to "some suspicion of insanity," he replied with a composed and candid
Enter Input : smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
Enter Input : had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,
Enter Input : was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
Enter Input : that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
Enter Input : delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
Enter Input : a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, "if only all
Enter Input : fresh shocks can be avoided," he added significantly. Then he got up,
Enter Input : took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm
Enter Input : gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna
Enter Input : spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased
Enter Input : with his visit and still more so with himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We'll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!" Razumihin said in conclusion,
Enter Input : following Zossimov out. "I'll be with you to-morrow morning as early as
Enter Input : possible with my report."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna," remarked Zossimov,
Enter Input : almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fetching? You said fetching?" roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov
Enter Input : and seized him by the throat. "If you ever dare.... Do you understand?
Enter Input : Do you understand?" he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing
Enter Input : him against the wall. "Do you hear?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me go, you drunken devil," said Zossimov, struggling and when he
Enter Input : had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.
Enter Input : Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, I am an ass," he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, "but
Enter Input : still... you are another."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They walked along in silence and only when they were close to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable
Enter Input : anxiety.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen," he said, "you're a first-rate fellow, but among your other
Enter Input : failings, you're a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You
Enter Input : are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you're getting fat
Enter Input : and lazy and can't deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because
Enter Input : it leads one straight into the dirt. You've let yourself get so slack
Enter Input : that I don't know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.
Enter Input : You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your
Enter Input : patients! In another three or four years you won't get up for your
Enter Input : patients... But hang it all, that's not the point!... You are going
Enter Input : to spend to-night in the landlady's flat here. (Hard work I've had to
Enter Input : persuade her!) And I'll be in the kitchen. So here's a chance for you to
Enter Input : get to know her better.... It's not as you think! There's not a trace of
Enter Input : anything of the sort, brother...!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I don't think!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage
Enter Input : virtue... and yet she's sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!
Enter Input : Save me from her, by all that's unholy! She's most prepossessing... I'll
Enter Input : repay you, I'll do anything...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It won't be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,
Enter Input : as long as you sit by her and talk. You're a doctor, too; try curing
Enter Input : her of something. I swear you won't regret it. She has a piano, and you
Enter Input : know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: 'I
Enter Input : shed hot tears.' She likes the genuine article--and well, it all
Enter Input : began with that song; Now you're a regular performer, a _maître_, a
Enter Input : Rubinstein.... I assure you, you won't regret it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of
Enter Input : marriage, perhaps?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not
Enter Input : that sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well then, drop her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I can't drop her like that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why can't you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, I can't, that's all about it! There's an element of attraction
Enter Input : here, brother."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then why have you fascinated her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I haven't fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.
Enter Input : But she won't care a straw whether it's you or I, so long as somebody
Enter Input : sits beside her, sighing.... I can't explain the position, brother...
Enter Input : look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin
Enter Input : teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I'm not joking, I'm
Enter Input : in earnest, it'll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh
Enter Input : for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time
Enter Input : about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she
Enter Input : just sighed and perspired! And you mustn't talk of love--she's bashful
Enter Input : to hysterics--but just let her see you can't tear yourself away--that's
Enter Input : enough. It's fearfully comfortable; you're quite at home, you can
Enter Input : read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you're
Enter Input : careful."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what do I want with her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, I can't make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!
Enter Input : I have often been reminded of you!... You'll come to it in the end! So
Enter Input : does it matter whether it's sooner or later? There's the feather-bed
Enter Input : element here, brother--ach! and not only that! There's an attraction
Enter Input : here--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,
Enter Input : the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the
Enter Input : world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening
Enter Input : samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as
Enter Input : snug as though you were dead, and yet you're alive--the advantages
Enter Input : of both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I'm talking, it's
Enter Input : bedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I'll go in and look at
Enter Input : him. But there's no need, it's all right. Don't you worry yourself,
Enter Input : yet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice
Enter Input : anything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can't be...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious.
Enter Input : He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
Enter Input : He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He
Enter Input : remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly
Enter Input : novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression
Enter Input : unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised
Enter Input : clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly
Enter Input : unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and
Enter Input : he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties
Enter Input : bequeathed him by that "thrice accursed yesterday."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown
Enter Input : himself "base and mean," not only because he had been drunk, but
Enter Input : because he had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuse
Enter Input : her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual
Enter Input : relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And
Enter Input : what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?
Enter Input : Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there
Enter Input : must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know
Enter Input : the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how
Enter Input : despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?
Enter Input : Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the
Enter Input : truth had all come out, "that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse
Enter Input : and envious heart"! And would such a dream ever be permissible to
Enter Input : him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy
Enter Input : braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical
Enter Input : a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and
Enter Input : suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had
Enter Input : said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist
Enter Input : down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the
Enter Input : bricks flying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course," he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of
Enter Input : self-abasement, "of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or
Enter Input : smoothed over... and so it's useless even to think of it, and I must
Enter Input : go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask
Enter Input : forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.
Enter Input : He hadn't another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put it
Enter Input : on. "I would have made a point of not putting it on." But in any case he
Enter Input : could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend
Enter Input : the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his
Enter Input : assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.
Enter Input : His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he
Enter Input : washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the
Enter Input : question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna
Enter Input : had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question
Enter Input : was angrily answered in the negative. "Let it stay as it is! What if
Enter Input : they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think
Enter Input : so! Not on any account!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the
Enter Input : manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had
Enter Input : some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be
Enter Input : proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all
Enter Input : the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly
Enter Input : dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to
Enter Input : set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he'd
Enter Input : make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he
Enter Input : wouldn't care! He'd be worse!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night
Enter Input : in Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
Enter Input : Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
Enter Input : Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him and promised to see
Enter Input : him again about eleven.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If he is still at home," he added. "Damn it all! If one can't control
Enter Input : one's patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will
Enter Input : go to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They are coming, I think," said Razumihin, understanding the object
Enter Input : of the question, "and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.
Enter Input : I'll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plenty
Enter Input : to do besides looking after them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One thing worries me," interposed Razumihin, frowning. "On the way home
Enter Input : I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and
Enter Input : amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You told the ladies so, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so
Enter Input : seriously?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,
Enter Input : yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to
Enter Input : him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with
Enter Input : your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,
Enter Input : perhaps, mad on that very point! If only I'd known what happened then
Enter Input : at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this
Enter Input : suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.
Enter Input : These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and
Enter Input : see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was
Enter Input : Zametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I
Enter Input : know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat
Enter Input : of a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he made
Enter Input : every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police
Enter Input : officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half
Enter Input : frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That
Enter Input : may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it
Enter Input : all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but
Enter Input : hm... he shouldn't have told all that last night. He is an awful
Enter Input : chatterbox!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But whom did he tell it to? You and me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Porfiry."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What does that matter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?
Enter Input : Tell them to be more careful with him to-day...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They'll get on all right!" Razumihin answered reluctantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn't
Enter Input : seem to dislike him... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what business is it of yours?" Razumihin cried with annoyance. "How
Enter Input : can I tell whether they've a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps
Enter Input : you'll find out...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night's wine has not gone off
Enter Input : yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night's
Enter Input : lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through
Enter Input : the door; she was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into her
Enter Input : from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's
Enter Input : house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They
Enter Input : had risen at seven o'clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as
Enter Input : night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He
Enter Input : had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at
Enter Input : him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced
Enter Input : timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that
Enter Input : moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such
Enter Input : complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and
Enter Input : ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater
Enter Input : confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a
Enter Input : subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because
Enter Input : "she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over
Enter Input : beforehand." Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation
Enter Input : to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and
Enter Input : they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such
Enter Input : a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin
Enter Input : vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped
Enter Input : in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's
Enter Input : questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted
Enter Input : by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the
Enter Input : most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life,
Enter Input : concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,
Enter Input : however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at
Enter Input : the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly
Enter Input : to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his
Enter Input : listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don't know
Enter Input : your name!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dmitri Prokofitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he
Enter Input : looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are
Enter Input : his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,
Enter Input : what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is
Enter Input : he now? In a word, I should like..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?" observed Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,
Enter Input : Dmitri Prokofitch!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Naturally," answered Razumihin. "I have no mother, but my uncle comes
Enter Input : every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in
Enter Input : appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years' separation
Enter Input : means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for
Enter Input : a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of
Enter Input : late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and
Enter Input : fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like
Enter Input : showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his
Enter Input : heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply
Enter Input : cold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he were alternating between
Enter Input : two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is
Enter Input : so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing
Enter Input : nothing. He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, but
Enter Input : as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles. He never listens
Enter Input : to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other
Enter Input : people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps
Enter Input : he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most
Enter Input : beneficial influence upon him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God grant it may," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by
Enter Input : Razumihin's account of her Rodya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
Enter Input : He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and
Enter Input : looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening
Enter Input : attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her
Enter Input : arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,
Enter Input : without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to
Enter Input : what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
Enter Input : white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of
Enter Input : extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed
Enter Input : like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps
Enter Input : just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery
Enter Input : of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be
Enter Input : afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very
Enter Input : trying for a man who already felt diffident.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother's
Enter Input : character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you
Enter Input : were too uncritically devoted to him," observed Avdotya Romanovna with
Enter Input : a smile. "I think you are right that he needs a woman's care," she added
Enter Input : thoughtfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He loves no one and perhaps he never will," Razumihin declared
Enter Input : decisively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You mean he is not capable of love?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in
Enter Input : everything, indeed!" he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but
Enter Input : remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,
Enter Input : he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna couldn't help laughing when she looked at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You may both be mistaken about Rodya," Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,
Enter Input : slightly piqued. "I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.
Enter Input : What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have
Enter Input : supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how
Enter Input : moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what
Enter Input : he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might
Enter Input : do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for
Enter Input : instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave
Enter Input : me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that
Enter Input : girl--what was her name--his landlady's daughter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you hear about that affair?" asked Avdotya Romanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you suppose----" Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. "Do you
Enter Input : suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from
Enter Input : grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have
Enter Input : disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn't that he doesn't love us!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has never spoken a word of that affair to me," Razumihin answered
Enter Input : cautiously. "But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,
Enter Input : though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was
Enter Input : rather strange."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what did you hear?" both the ladies asked at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which
Enter Input : only failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all to
Enter Input : Praskovya Pavlovna's liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all
Enter Input : pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and
Enter Input : queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have
Enter Input : had some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She had no money
Enter Input : either and he wouldn't have considered her money.... But it's always
Enter Input : difficult to judge in such matters."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am sure she was a good girl," Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don't know
Enter Input : which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her
Enter Input : or she to him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began
Enter Input : tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with
Enter Input : Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to
Enter Input : the latter's annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently
Enter Input : caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in
Enter Input : detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly
Enter Input : blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not
Enter Input : seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He had planned it before his illness," he added.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I think so, too," Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.
Enter Input : But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself
Enter Input : so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : could not resist asking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband,"
Enter Input : Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, "and I don't say it simply
Enter Input : from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna
Enter Input : has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so
Enter Input : rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...
Enter Input : mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this
Enter Input : morning I am ashamed of it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not
Enter Input : break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began
Enter Input : to speak of Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what
Enter Input : to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she
Enter Input : confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. "I'll be perfectly open with
Enter Input : Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This is what it is," she began in haste, as though the permission to
Enter Input : speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. "Very early this
Enter Input : morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter
Enter Input : announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you
Enter Input : know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these
Enter Input : lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would
Enter Input : be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.
Enter Input : You'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me
Enter Input : very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid
Enter Input : opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya's character better than
Enter Input : anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell
Enter Input : you, made her decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to act
Enter Input : and I... I've been waiting for your opinion."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read
Enter Input : as follows:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you
Enter Input : that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at
Enter Input : the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object
Enter Input : in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with
Enter Input : you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of
Enter Input : delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you
Enter Input : are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have
Enter Input : the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings
Enter Input : not later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, and
Enter Input : herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative
Enter Input : request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as
Enter Input : he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my
Enter Input : visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire
Enter Input : from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation
Enter Input : upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own
Enter Input : interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,
Enter Input : that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be
Enter Input : compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to
Enter Input : blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so
Enter Input : ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able
Enter Input : to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief
Enter Input : by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who
Enter Input : was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of
Enter Input : notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the
Enter Input : funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to
Enter Input : raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable
Enter Input : daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage
Enter Input : of
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your humble servant,
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "P. LUZHIN."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?" began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
Enter Input : almost weeping. "How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted
Enter Input : so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not
Enter Input : to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will
Enter Input : happen then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision," Razumihin answered calmly at
Enter Input : once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn't
Enter Input : explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that
Enter Input : it would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya should
Enter Input : make a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet....
Enter Input : I didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him
Enter Input : from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so
Enter Input : irritable.... Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who died
Enter Input : and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the
Enter Input : money... which..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Which cost you such sacrifice, mother," put in Avdotya Romanovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He was not himself yesterday," Razumihin said thoughtfully, "if you
Enter Input : only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there
Enter Input : was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home
Enter Input : yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand
Enter Input : a word.... But last night, I myself..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and
Enter Input : there I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done. Besides,
Enter Input : it's getting late--good heavens, it's past ten," she cried looking at
Enter Input : a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin
Enter Input : Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her
Enter Input : dress. "A present from her _fiancé_," thought Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We must start, Dounia, we must start," her mother cried in a flutter.
Enter Input : "He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming
Enter Input : so late. Merciful heavens!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;
Enter Input : Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were
Enter Input : not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty
Enter Input : gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in
Enter Input : people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently
Enter Input : at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. "The queen who mended her
Enter Input : stockings in prison," he thought, "must have looked then every inch a
Enter Input : queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My God!" exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "little did I think that I
Enter Input : should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,
Enter Input : Dmitri Prokofitch," she added, glancing at him timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be afraid, mother," said Dounia, kissing her, "better have faith
Enter Input : in him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept all night,"
Enter Input : exclaimed the poor woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They came out into the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took
Enter Input : my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were
Enter Input : blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don't know, Dmitri
Enter Input : Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She died suddenly; and only fancy..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Afterwards, mamma," put in Dounia. "He doesn't know who Marfa Petrovna
Enter Input : is."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, you don't know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.
Enter Input : Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don't know what I am thinking about
Enter Input : these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and
Enter Input : so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a
Enter Input : relation.... Don't be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what's the
Enter Input : matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I bruised it," muttered Razumihin overjoyed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault
Enter Input : with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether
Enter Input : he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,
Enter Input : you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy
Enter Input : him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to
Enter Input : treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don't
Enter Input : ask him too much about his health; he doesn't like that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the
Enter Input : stairs.... What an awful staircase!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother, you are quite pale, don't distress yourself, darling," said
Enter Input : Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: "He ought to be
Enter Input : happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he has waked up."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they
Enter Input : reached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her
Enter Input : door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching
Enter Input : them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was
Enter Input : suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried
Enter Input : out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is well, quite well!" Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place
Enter Input : as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,
Enter Input : fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for
Enter Input : some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed
Enter Input : to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the
Enter Input : day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like
Enter Input : a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
Enter Input : His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke
Enter Input : little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a
Enter Input : restlessness in his movements.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete
Enter Input : the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The
Enter Input : pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister
Enter Input : entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in
Enter Input : place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look
Enter Input : of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient
Enter Input : with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed
Enter Input : in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of
Enter Input : bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable
Enter Input : torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following
Enter Input : conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But
Enter Input : at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself
Enter Input : and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a
Enter Input : monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well," said Raskolnikov,
Enter Input : giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna radiant at once. "And I don't say this _as I did
Enter Input : yesterday_," he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of
Enter Input : his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day," began Zossimov, much
Enter Input : delighted at the ladies' entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping
Enter Input : up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. "In another three or
Enter Input : four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,
Enter Input : as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been
Enter Input : coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been
Enter Input : perhaps your own fault?" he added, with a tentative smile, as though
Enter Input : still afraid of irritating him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is very possible," answered Raskolnikov coldly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should say, too," continued Zossimov with zest, "that your complete
Enter Input : recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,
Enter Input : I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the
Enter Input : elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your
Enter Input : morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go
Enter Input : from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don't know, but they must
Enter Input : be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed
Enter Input : yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement
Enter Input : coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without
Enter Input : occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I
Enter Input : fancy, be very beneficial."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to
Enter Input : the university: and then everything will go smoothly...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before
Enter Input : the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his
Enter Input : patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted
Enter Input : an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking
Enter Input : Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! he saw you last night?" Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.
Enter Input : "Then you have not slept either after your journey."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o'clock. Dounia and I never go to
Enter Input : bed before two at home."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know how to thank him either," Raskolnikov went on,
Enter Input : suddenly frowning and looking down. "Setting aside the question of
Enter Input : payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I
Enter Input : really don't know what I have done to deserve such special attention
Enter Input : from you! I simply don't understand it... and... and... it weighs upon
Enter Input : me, indeed, because I don't understand it. I tell you so candidly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be irritated." Zossimov forced himself to laugh. "Assume that you
Enter Input : are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love
Enter Input : our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in
Enter Input : love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say nothing about him," added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,
Enter Input : "though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,
Enter Input : are you?" shouted Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no
Enter Input : trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.
Enter Input : But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching
Enter Input : her brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak," he went on, as though
Enter Input : repeating a lesson learned by heart. "It is only to-day that I have
Enter Input : been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here
Enter Input : yesterday, waiting for me to come back."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,
Enter Input : smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real
Enter Input : unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his
Enter Input : hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her
Enter Input : since their dispute the previous day. The mother's face lighted up
Enter Input : with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken
Enter Input : reconciliation. "Yes, that is what I love him for," Razumihin,
Enter Input : exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his
Enter Input : chair. "He has these movements."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And how well he does it all," the mother was thinking to herself. "What
Enter Input : generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end
Enter Input : to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his
Enter Input : hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what
Enter Input : fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better
Enter Input : looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly
Enter Input : he's dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, is
Enter Input : better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but
Enter Input : I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he's so strange! He's talking kindly, but I'm
Enter Input : afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, Rodya, you wouldn't believe," she began suddenly, in haste to
Enter Input : answer his words to her, "how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now
Enter Input : that it's all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can
Enter Input : tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace
Enter Input : you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told
Enter Input : us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away
Enter Input : from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the
Enter Input : streets. You can't imagine how we felt! I couldn't help thinking of the
Enter Input : tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father's--you
Enter Input : can't remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever
Enter Input : and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn't pull him out
Enter Input : till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of
Enter Input : rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were
Enter Input : alone, utterly alone," she said plaintively and stopped short,
Enter Input : suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch, although "we are quite happy again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes.... Of course it's very annoying...." Raskolnikov muttered in
Enter Input : reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed
Enter Input : at him in perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What else was it I wanted to say?" He went on trying to recollect. "Oh,
Enter Input : yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don't think that I didn't mean
Enter Input : to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you saying, Rodya?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,
Enter Input : was surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is he answering us as a duty?" Dounia wondered. "Is he being reconciled
Enter Input : and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating
Enter Input : a lesson?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing
Enter Input : to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out
Enter Input : the blood... I've only just dressed."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Blood! What blood?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, nothing--don't be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about
Enter Input : yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run
Enter Input : over... a clerk..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Delirious? But you remember everything!" Razumihin interrupted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's true," Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. "I
Enter Input : remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did
Enter Input : that and went there and said that, I can't clearly explain now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A familiar phenomenon," interposed Zossimov, "actions are sometimes
Enter Input : performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the
Enter Input : actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it's
Enter Input : like a dream."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps it's a good thing really that he should think me almost a
Enter Input : madman," thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too," observed
Enter Input : Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There is some truth in your observation," the latter replied. "In that
Enter Input : sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the
Enter Input : slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we
Enter Input : must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among
Enter Input : dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the word "madman," carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on
Enter Input : his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a
Enter Input : strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!"
Enter Input : Razumihin cried hastily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?" Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. "Oh... I got spattered with
Enter Input : blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an
Enter Input : unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave
Enter Input : away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She's
Enter Input : a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,
Enter Input : starving... nothing in the house... there's a daughter, too... perhaps
Enter Input : you'd have given it yourself if you'd seen them. But I had no right to
Enter Input : do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
Enter Input : To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,
Enter Input : chiens, si vous n'êtes pas contents_." He laughed, "That's right, isn't
Enter Input : it, Dounia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it's not," answered Dounia firmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bah! you, too, have ideals," he muttered, looking at her almost with
Enter Input : hatred, and smiling sarcastically. "I ought to have considered that....
Enter Input : Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you... and if you reach a
Enter Input : line you won't overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,
Enter Input : maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that's nonsense," he added
Enter Input : irritably, vexed at being carried away. "I only meant to say that I beg
Enter Input : your forgiveness, mother," he concluded, shortly and abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,"
Enter Input : said his mother, delighted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be too sure," he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this
Enter Input : conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the
Enter Input : forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is as though they were afraid of me," Raskolnikov was thinking
Enter Input : to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much," flashed through
Enter Input : his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead," Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : suddenly blurted out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What Marfa Petrovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about
Enter Input : her."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she's dead! Oh, really?" he roused
Enter Input : himself suddenly, as if waking up. "What did she die of?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only imagine, quite suddenly," Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered
Enter Input : hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. "On the very day I was sending
Enter Input : you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been
Enter Input : the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, were they on such bad terms?" he asked, addressing his sister.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very
Enter Input : patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their
Enter Input : married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All
Enter Input : of a sudden he seems to have lost patience."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven
Enter Input : years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no, he's an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!" Dounia
Enter Input : answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That had happened in the morning," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on
Enter Input : hurriedly. "And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be
Enter Input : harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used
Enter Input : to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am
Enter Input : told...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "After the beating?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not
Enter Input : to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was
Enter Input : undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and
Enter Input : she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got
Enter Input : into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think so," said Zossimov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And did he beat her badly?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What does that matter!" put in Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "H'm! But I don't know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,"
Enter Input : said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, my dear, I don't know what to talk about," broke from Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, are you all afraid of me?" he asked, with a constrained smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's certainly true," said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at
Enter Input : her brother. "Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the
Enter Input : stairs."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His face worked, as though in convulsion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don't be angry, please, Rodya....
Enter Input : Why did you say that, Dounia?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,
Enter Input : overwhelmed--"You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the
Enter Input : train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything
Enter Input : together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what
Enter Input : am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy
Enter Input : now--simply in seeing you, Rodya...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hush, mother," he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but
Enter Input : pressing her hand. "We shall have time to speak freely of everything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
Enter Input : pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
Enter Input : chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to
Enter Input : him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be
Enter Input : able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to
Enter Input : _speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that
Enter Input : for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not
Enter Input : looking at anyone walked towards the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you about?" cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were
Enter Input : all looking at him in perplexity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what are you all so dull for?" he shouted, suddenly and quite
Enter Input : unexpectedly. "Do say something! What's the use of sitting like this?
Enter Input : Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
Enter Input : Come, anything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning
Enter Input : again," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is the matter, Rodya?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, nothing! I remembered something," he answered, and suddenly
Enter Input : laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, if you remembered something; that's all right!... I was beginning
Enter Input : to think..." muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. "It is time
Enter Input : for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can..." He made
Enter Input : his bows, and went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What an excellent man!" observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent," Raskolnikov
Enter Input : began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he
Enter Input : had not shown till then. "I can't remember where I met him before my
Enter Input : illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good
Enter Input : man, too," he nodded at Razumihin. "Do you like him, Dounia?" he asked
Enter Input : her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very much," answered Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo!--what a pig you are!" Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible
Enter Input : confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
Enter Input : faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are you off to?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must go."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don't go.
Enter Input : What's the time? Is it twelve o'clock? What a pretty watch you have got,
Enter Input : Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was a present from Marfa Petrovna," answered Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And a very expensive one!" added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady's."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I like that sort," said Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So it is not a present from her _fiancé_," thought Razumihin, and was
Enter Input : unreasonably delighted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I thought it was Luzhin's present," observed Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
Enter Input : married?" he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted
Enter Input : by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, yes, my dear."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "H'm, yes. What shall I tell you? I don't remember much indeed. She was
Enter Input : such a sickly girl," he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.
Enter Input : "Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was
Enter Input : always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she
Enter Input : began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very
Enter Input : well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don't know what drew me
Enter Input : to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been
Enter Input : lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still," he
Enter Input : smiled dreamily. "Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it was not only spring delirium," said Dounia, with warm feeling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did
Enter Input : not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,
Enter Input : went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You love her even now?" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that's all now, as
Enter Input : it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything
Enter Input : happening here seems somehow far away." He looked attentively at them.
Enter Input : "You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
Enter Input : but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what's the use of
Enter Input : asking about it?" he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell
Enter Input : into dreamy silence again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It's like a tomb," said
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. "I
Enter Input : am sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become so
Enter Input : melancholy."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My lodging," he answered, listlessly. "Yes, the lodging had a great
Enter Input : deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,
Enter Input : what a strange thing you said just now, mother," he said, laughing
Enter Input : strangely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,
Enter Input : with him after three years' absence, this intimate tone of conversation,
Enter Input : in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,
Enter Input : would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent
Enter Input : matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had
Enter Input : decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of
Enter Input : escape.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, Dounia," he began, gravely and drily, "of course I beg your
Enter Input : pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that
Enter Input : I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a
Enter Input : scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease
Enter Input : at once to look on you as a sister."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again," Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. "And why do you call yourself a
Enter Input : scoundrel? I can't bear it. You said the same yesterday."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Brother," Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. "In all
Enter Input : this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,
Enter Input : and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am
Enter Input : sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at
Enter Input : all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for
Enter Input : me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to
Enter Input : my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She is lying," he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.
Enter Input : "Proud creature! She won't admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too
Enter Input : haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,
Enter Input : how I... hate them all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In fact," continued Dounia, "I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of
Enter Input : two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of
Enter Input : me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?" She, too,
Enter Input : flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All?" he asked, with a malignant grin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch's
Enter Input : courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too
Enter Input : well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing
Enter Input : again?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are
Enter Input : intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your
Enter Input : own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked
Enter Input : with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you
Enter Input : are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is not true. I am not lying," cried Dounia, losing her composure.
Enter Input : "I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me
Enter Input : and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly
Enter Input : convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing
Enter Input : proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as
Enter Input : you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a
Enter Input : vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
Enter Input : Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It
Enter Input : is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I
Enter Input : am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you
Enter Input : so pale? Rodya, darling, what's the matter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! You have made him faint," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no, nonsense! It's nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You
Enter Input : have fainting on the brain. H'm, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In
Enter Input : what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,
Enter Input : and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch's letter," said Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He
Enter Input : took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked
Enter Input : with a sort of wonder at Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is strange," he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. "What
Enter Input : am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for
Enter Input : some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at
Enter Input : last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,
Enter Input : slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected
Enter Input : something particular.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What surprises me," he began, after a short pause, handing the letter
Enter Input : to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, "is that he is a
Enter Input : business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and
Enter Input : yet he writes such an uneducated letter."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They all started. They had expected something quite different.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But they all write like that, you know," Razumihin observed, abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you read it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now," Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just the jargon of the courts," Razumihin put in. "Legal
Enter Input : documents are written like that to this day."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Legal? Yes, it's just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,
Enter Input : and not quite educated--business language!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
Enter Input : education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way," Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother's tone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, if he's proud of it, he has reason, I don't deny it. You seem to
Enter Input : be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
Enter Input : letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
Enter Input : annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style
Enter Input : occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There
Enter Input : is one expression, 'blame yourselves' put in very significantly and
Enter Input : plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I
Enter Input : am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon
Enter Input : you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning
Enter Input : you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an
Enter Input : expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
Enter Input : written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no," answered Dounia, with more animation. "I saw clearly that it
Enter Input : was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill
Enter Input : in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,
Enter Input : indeed..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he
Enter Input : intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression
Enter Input : in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I
Enter Input : gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed
Enter Input : with trouble, and not 'on the pretext of the funeral,' but simply to pay
Enter Input : for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,
Enter Input : of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my
Enter Input : life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander
Enter Input : me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal
Enter Input : jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and
Enter Input : with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act
Enter Input : sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I
Enter Input : don't think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to
Enter Input : warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only
Enter Input : awaiting the evening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then what is your decision, Rodya?" asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who
Enter Input : was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his
Enter Input : talk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What decision?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
Enter Input : evening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are
Enter Input : not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is
Enter Input : not offended. I will do what you think best," he added, drily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her," Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at
Enter Input : this interview," said Dounia. "Will you come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock," she said,
Enter Input : addressing Razumihin. "Mother, I am inviting him, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided," added Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, "so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like
Enter Input : concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!"

Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into
Enter Input : the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with
Enter Input : surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise
Enter Input : her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for
Enter Input : the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such
Enter Input : a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she
Enter Input : was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,
Enter Input : almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but
Enter Input : somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor
Enter Input : dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a
Enter Input : parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so
Enter Input : much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a
Enter Input : little child. She was even about to retreat. "Oh... it's you!" said
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once
Enter Input : recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin's letter
Enter Input : of "some young woman of notorious behaviour." He had only just been
Enter Input : protesting against Luzhin's calumny and declaring that he had seen the
Enter Input : girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He
Enter Input : remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression "of
Enter Input : notorious behaviour." All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through
Enter Input : his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated
Enter Input : creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she
Enter Input : made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I did not expect you," he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her
Enter Input : stop. "Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : Allow me--not there. Sit here...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to
Enter Input : enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
Enter Input : Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him
Enter Input : as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to
Enter Input : Razumihin's chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You sit here," he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the
Enter Input : two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she
Enter Input : could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened
Enter Input : that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you," she
Enter Input : began falteringly. "I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to
Enter Input : send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
Enter Input : the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...
Enter Input : to do her the honour... she told me to beg you..." Sonia stammered and
Enter Input : ceased speaking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will try, certainly, most certainly," answered Raskolnikov. He,
Enter Input : too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.
Enter Input : "Please sit down," he said, suddenly. "I want to talk to you. You are
Enter Input : perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes," and
Enter Input : he drew up a chair for her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened
Enter Input : look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov's pale face
Enter Input : flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother," he said, firmly and insistently, "this is Sofya Semyonovna
Enter Input : Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run
Enter Input : over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up
Enter Input : her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya's urgent and
Enter Input : challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia
Enter Input : gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinised
Enter Input : her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise
Enter Input : her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I wanted to ask you," said Raskolnikov, hastily, "how things were
Enter Input : arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...
Enter Input : they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At the body's remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,
Enter Input : to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until
Enter Input : to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees
Enter Input : herself that it's necessary..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To-day, then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the
Enter Input : service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She is giving a funeral lunch?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping
Enter Input : us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she
Enter Input : controlled herself, looking down again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a
Enter Input : thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a
Enter Input : sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but
Enter Input : her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such
Enter Input : a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help
Enter Input : being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another
Enter Input : peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked
Enter Input : almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this
Enter Input : childishness seemed almost absurd.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
Enter Input : Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?" Raskolnikov asked,
Enter Input : persistently keeping up the conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so
Enter Input : it won't cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so
Enter Input : that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious
Enter Input : it should be so. You know one can't... it's a comfort to her... she is
Enter Input : like that, you know...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room
Enter Input : like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You gave us everything yesterday," Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a
Enter Input : loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips
Enter Input : and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once
Enter Input : by Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words broke out
Enter Input : spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia's eyes,
Enter Input : and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya," she said, getting up, "we shall have dinner together, of
Enter Input : course. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little
Enter Input : walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am
Enter Input : afraid we have exhausted you...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, I'll come," he answered, getting up fussily. "But I have
Enter Input : something to see to."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But surely you will have dinner together?" cried Razumihin, looking in
Enter Input : surprise at Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.
Enter Input : You do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him
Enter Input : from you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining
Enter Input : with us?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Please do," added Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all
Enter Input : strangely embarrassed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.
Enter Input : Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed
Enter Input : to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother
Enter Input : out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave
Enter Input : a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort
Enter Input : in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy and attention were
Enter Input : oppressive and painful to her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia, good-bye," called Raskolnikov, in the passage. "Give me your
Enter Input : hand."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?" said Dounia, turning
Enter Input : warmly and awkwardly to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Never mind, give it to me again." And he squeezed her fingers warmly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, that's capital," he said to Sonia, going back and looking
Enter Input : brightly at her. "God give peace to the dead, the living have still to
Enter Input : live. That is right, isn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked
Enter Input : at her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father
Enter Input : floated before his memory in those moments....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : *****
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Heavens, Dounia," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in
Enter Input : the street, "I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.
Enter Input : How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad
Enter Input : of that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don't you see it?
Enter Input : Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much
Enter Input : can be forgiven."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you were not very patient!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,
Enter Input : hotly and jealously. "Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You
Enter Input : are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You
Enter Input : are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both
Enter Input : generous.... Surely he can't be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of
Enter Input : what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : breaks it off?" poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He won't be worth much if he does," answered Dounia, sharply and
Enter Input : contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We did well to come away," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.
Enter Input : "He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has
Enter Input : a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is
Enter Input : one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up
Enter Input : rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will
Enter Input : crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I
Enter Input : declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,
Enter Input : too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What young woman, mother?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but
Enter Input : as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief
Enter Input : cause of the trouble...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing of the sort!" cried Dounia, in vexation. "What nonsense, with
Enter Input : your presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening
Enter Input : before, and he did not know her when she came in."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will
Enter Input : see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could
Enter Input : scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you
Enter Input : remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that
Enter Input : about her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great
Enter Input : deal of her."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,
Enter Input : too. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it
Enter Input : is all nonsense."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God grant it may be!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer," Dounia snapped out,
Enter Input : suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : *****
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will tell you what I want with you," said Raskolnikov, drawing
Enter Input : Razumihin to the window.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming," Sonia said
Enter Input : hurriedly, preparing to depart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our
Enter Input : way. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!" he turned
Enter Input : suddenly to Razumihin again. "You know that... what's his name...
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think so! He is a relation. Why?" added the latter, with
Enter Input : interest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You
Enter Input : were speaking about it yesterday."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... well?" Razumihin's eyes opened wide.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some
Enter Input : pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when
Enter Input : I left home, and my father's silver watch--they are only worth five or
Enter Input : six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I
Enter Input : do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just
Enter Input : now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia's
Enter Input : watch. It is the only thing of father's left us. She would be ill if
Enter Input : it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I
Enter Input : ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be
Enter Input : better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter
Enter Input : might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before
Enter Input : dinner."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry," Razumihin
Enter Input : shouted in extraordinary excitement. "Well, how glad I am. Let us go at
Enter Input : once. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well, let us go."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have
Enter Input : often talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you
Enter Input : yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that's it! It is all
Enter Input : turning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sofya Semyonovna," corrected Raskolnikov. "Sofya Semyonovna, this is my
Enter Input : friend Razumihin, and he is a good man."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If you have to go now," Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin
Enter Input : at all, and still more embarrassed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let us go," decided Raskolnikov. "I will come to you to-day, Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her
Enter Input : eyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went
Enter Input : out together.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't you lock up?" asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Never," answered Raskolnikov. "I have been meaning to buy a lock for
Enter Input : these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks," he said,
Enter Input : laughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the
Enter Input : way?" he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He
Enter Input : wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?
Enter Input : Did I give her the address?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, had you forgotten?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I remember."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,
Enter Input : and he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,
Enter Input : I asked to-day, 'Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?' I did not know you
Enter Input : had only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,
Enter Input : hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty
Enter Input : steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then
Enter Input : moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to
Enter Input : remember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she
Enter Input : felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was
Enter Input : opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to
Enter Input : come to her that day, perhaps at once!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only not to-day, please, not to-day!" she kept muttering with a sinking
Enter Input : heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. "Mercy! to
Enter Input : me... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who
Enter Input : was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from
Enter Input : the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood
Enter Input : still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,
Enter Input : started on hearing Sonia's words: "and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : lived?" He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially
Enter Input : upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted
Enter Input : the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not
Enter Input : to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for
Enter Input : something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and
Enter Input : that Sonia was going home.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Home? Where? I've seen that face somewhere," he thought. "I must find
Enter Input : out."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the
Enter Input : same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on
Enter Input : the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook
Enter Input : her and kept two or three yards behind her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high
Enter Input : shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore
Enter Input : good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.
Enter Input : He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each
Enter Input : step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face
Enter Input : with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.
Enter Input : His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with
Enter Input : grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.
Enter Input : His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were
Enter Input : crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger
Enter Input : than his years.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on
Enter Input : the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching
Enter Input : the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed
Enter Input : her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right
Enter Input : corner. "Bah!" muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs
Enter Input : behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,
Enter Input : turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed
Enter Input : in chalk, "Kapernaumov, Tailor." "Bah!" the stranger repeated again,
Enter Input : wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.
Enter Input : The doors were two or three yards apart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You lodge at Kapernaumov's," he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.
Enter Input : "He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at
Enter Input : Madame Resslich's. How odd!" Sonia looked at him attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We are neighbours," he went on gaily. "I only came to town the day
Enter Input : before yesterday. Good-bye for the present."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for
Enter Input : some reason ashamed and uneasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : *****
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the way to Porfiry's, Razumihin was obviously excited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's capital, brother," he repeated several times, "and I am glad! I
Enter Input : am glad!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you glad about?" Raskolnikov thought to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too. And...
Enter Input : was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a simple-hearted fool he is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "When was it?" Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. "Two or three
Enter Input : days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem
Enter Input : the things now," he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous
Enter Input : solicitude about the things. "I've not more than a silver rouble
Enter Input : left... after last night's accursed delirium!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He laid special emphasis on the delirium.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes," Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. "Then
Enter Input : that's why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you
Enter Input : were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that's
Enter Input : clear, it's all clear now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will
Enter Input : go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared
Enter Input : up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have
Enter Input : on all of them!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Shall we find him?" he asked suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, yes," Razumihin answered quickly. "He is a nice fellow, you will
Enter Input : see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished
Enter Input : manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent
Enter Input : fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He
Enter Input : is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or
Enter Input : rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....
Enter Input : But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a
Enter Input : case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very
Enter Input : anxious to make your acquaintance!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "On what grounds is he so anxious?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, it's not exactly... you see, since you've been ill I happen to have
Enter Input : mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about
Enter Input : your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,
Enter Input : 'What a pity!' And so I concluded... from everything together, not only
Enter Input : that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on
Enter Input : the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,
Enter Input : of your exaggerating it, you see."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right," he said
Enter Input : with a constrained smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was
Enter Input : something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!" Raskolnikov cried
Enter Input : with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One's ashamed
Enter Input : to speak of it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov
Enter Input : perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had
Enter Input : just said about Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I shall have to pull a long face with him too," he thought, with a
Enter Input : beating heart, and he turned white, "and do it naturally, too. But the
Enter Input : most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing
Enter Input : at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we
Enter Input : shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good
Enter Input : thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is
Enter Input : beating, that's what's bad!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In this grey house," said Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old
Enter Input : hag's flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out
Enter Input : instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I'll
Enter Input : find out, if it's my ruin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, brother," he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly
Enter Input : smile, "I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously
Enter Input : excited. Isn't it so?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excited? Not a bit of it," said Razumihin, stung to the quick.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair
Enter Input : in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be
Enter Input : writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you
Enter Input : were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even
Enter Input : blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed
Enter Input : awfully."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there
Enter Input : he's blushing again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a pig you are!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I'll tell of you
Enter Input : to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I'll make mother laugh, and someone else, too..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!"
Enter Input : Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. "What will
Enter Input : you tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a
Enter Input : Romeo over six foot high! And how you've washed to-day--you cleaned your
Enter Input : nails, I declare. Eh? That's something unheard of! Why, I do believe
Enter Input : you've got pomatum on your hair! Bend down."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pig!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So
Enter Input : laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch's flat. This is what
Enter Input : Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they
Enter Input : came in, still guffawing in the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not a word here or I'll... brain you!" Razumihin whispered furiously,
Enter Input : seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though
Enter Input : he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him
Enter Input : Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,
Enter Input : with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and
Enter Input : whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,
Enter Input : bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room
Enter Input : looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still
Enter Input : apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few
Enter Input : words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming
Enter Input : a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as
Enter Input : though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:
Enter Input : his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried
Enter Input : to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received
Enter Input : this "spontaneous" mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most
Enter Input : genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as
Enter Input : though on purpose.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fool! You fiend," he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a
Enter Input : little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent
Enter Input : flying and crashing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it's a loss to the Crown,"
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch's,
Enter Input : but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural
Enter Input : end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table
Enter Input : and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and
Enter Input : turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back
Enter Input : to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but
Enter Input : obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the
Enter Input : corner, but he rose at the visitors' entrance and was standing in
Enter Input : expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and
Enter Input : even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a
Enter Input : certain embarrassment. Zametov's unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov
Enter Input : unpleasantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've got to think of that," he thought. "Excuse me, please," he began,
Enter Input : affecting extreme embarrassment. "Raskolnikov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you've come
Enter Input : in.... Why, won't he even say good-morning?" Porfiry Petrovitch nodded
Enter Input : at Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my honour I don't know why he is in such a rage with me. I only
Enter Input : told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And
Enter Input : that was all, I think!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pig!" ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at
Enter Input : the word," Porfiry laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!" snapped Razumihin, and suddenly
Enter Input : bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more
Enter Input : cheerful face as though nothing had happened. "That'll do! We are
Enter Input : all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch
Enter Input : Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make
Enter Input : your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with
Enter Input : you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you
Enter Input : known each other long?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What does this mean?" thought Raskolnikov uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday," he said easily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me
Enter Input : to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out
Enter Input : without me. Where is your tobacco?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and
Enter Input : trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,
Enter Input : stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short
Enter Input : and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His
Enter Input : soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,
Enter Input : but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been
Enter Input : good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,
Enter Input : mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression
Enter Input : of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish
Enter Input : figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at
Enter Input : first sight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter
Enter Input : of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down
Enter Input : himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with
Enter Input : that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and
Enter Input : embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are
Enter Input : discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such
Enter Input : exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov
Enter Input : explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied
Enter Input : with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,
Enter Input : sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,
Enter Input : looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive
Enter Input : interest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Fool," Raskolnikov swore to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You have to give information to the police," Porfiry replied, with a
Enter Input : most businesslike air, "that having learnt of this incident, that is of
Enter Input : the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such
Enter Input : and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...
Enter Input : or... but they will write to you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just the point, that at the present moment," Raskolnikov tried
Enter Input : his utmost to feign embarrassment, "I am not quite in funds... and
Enter Input : even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for
Enter Input : the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have
Enter Input : money...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's no matter," answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his
Enter Input : explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, "but you can, if you
Enter Input : prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the
Enter Input : matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "On an ordinary sheet of paper?" Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again
Enter Input : interested in the financial side of the question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, the most ordinary," and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with
Enter Input : obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at
Enter Input : him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for it all lasted but a
Enter Input : moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could
Enter Input : have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He knows," flashed through his mind like lightning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Forgive my troubling you about such trifles," he went on, a little
Enter Input : disconcerted, "the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them
Enter Input : particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must
Enter Input : confess that I was alarmed when I heard..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that
Enter Input : Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!" Razumihin put in
Enter Input : with obvious intention.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him
Enter Input : with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately
Enter Input : recollected himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem to be jeering at me, brother?" he said to him, with a
Enter Input : well-feigned irritability. "I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious
Enter Input : about such trash; but you mustn't think me selfish or grasping for that,
Enter Input : and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you
Enter Input : just now that the silver watch, though it's not worth a cent, is the
Enter Input : only thing left us of my father's. You may laugh at me, but my mother is
Enter Input : here," he turned suddenly to Porfiry, "and if she knew," he turned again
Enter Input : hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, "that the
Enter Input : watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not a bit of it! I didn't mean that at all! Quite the contrary!"
Enter Input : shouted Razumihin distressed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?" Raskolnikov asked
Enter Input : himself in a tremor. "Why did I say that about women?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, your mother is with you?" Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "When did she come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Last night."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry paused as though reflecting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your things would not in any case be lost," he went on calmly and
Enter Input : coldly. "I have been expecting you here for some time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered
Enter Input : the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash
Enter Input : over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be
Enter Input : looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin's cigarette.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?"
Enter Input : cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on
Enter Input : the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the
Enter Input : date on which you left them with her..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How observant you are!" Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very
Enter Input : utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly
Enter Input : added:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it
Enter Input : must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so
Enter Input : clearly, and... and..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stupid! Feeble!" he thought. "Why did I add that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn't
Enter Input : come forward," Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I haven't been quite well."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress
Enter Input : about something. You look pale still."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well," Raskolnikov snapped
Enter Input : out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was
Enter Input : mounting, he could not repress it. "And in my anger I shall betray
Enter Input : myself," flashed through his mind again. "Why are they torturing me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not quite well!" Razumihin caught him up. "What next! He was
Enter Input : unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as
Enter Input : soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,
Enter Input : and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,
Enter Input : delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Really delirious? You don't say so!" Porfiry shook his head in a
Enter Input : womanish way.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nonsense! Don't you believe it! But you don't believe it anyway,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem
Enter Input : to catch those strange words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how could you have gone out if you hadn't been delirious?"
Enter Input : Razumihin got hot suddenly. "What did you go out for? What was the
Enter Input : object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did
Enter Input : it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was awfully sick of them yesterday." Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry
Enter Input : suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, "I ran away from them to
Enter Input : take lodgings where they wouldn't find me, and took a lot of money with
Enter Input : me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or
Enter Input : delirious yesterday; settle our dispute."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his
Enter Input : expression and his silence to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were
Enter Input : extremely irritable," Zametov pronounced dryly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day," put in Porfiry Petrovitch,
Enter Input : "that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had
Enter Input : been run over."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And there," said Razumihin, "weren't you mad then? You gave your last
Enter Input : penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen
Enter Input : or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he
Enter Input : flung away all the twenty-five at once!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So
Enter Input : that's why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I've found a
Enter Input : treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour
Enter Input : with such trivialities," he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with
Enter Input : trembling lips. "We are boring you, aren't we?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you
Enter Input : interest me! It's interesting to look on and listen... and I am really
Enter Input : glad you have come forward at last."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you might give us some tea! My throat's dry," cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn't you
Enter Input : like... something more essential before tea?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Get along with you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand on
Enter Input : ceremony! And how if you didn't know me at all, did you come to talk
Enter Input : to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don't care to hide that they are
Enter Input : tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face." He was
Enter Input : shaking with rage. "Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like a
Enter Input : cat with a mouse. It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I
Enter Input : won't allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly
Enter Input : faces, and you'll see how I despise you." He could hardly breathe.
Enter Input : "And what if it's only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through
Enter Input : inexperience I get angry and don't keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it's
Enter Input : all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is
Enter Input : something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.
Enter Input : Why did he say bluntly, 'With her'? Why did Zametov add that I spoke
Enter Input : artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin
Enter Input : is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never
Enter Input : does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of
Enter Input : course it's nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset
Enter Input : my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it's ill fancy or they know!
Enter Input : Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.
Enter Input : I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it's my
Enter Input : first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back
Enter Input : to him. They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they
Enter Input : were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If
Enter Input : only they'd make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he
Enter Input : let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use
Enter Input : afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last
Enter Input : night! He didn't know of my mother's arrival! The hag had written the
Enter Input : date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won't catch me! There are no
Enter Input : facts... it's all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn't a
Enter Input : fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the
Enter Input : flat? I won't go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being
Enter Input : angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that's
Enter Input : right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch
Enter Input : me. Why did I come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All this flashed like lightning through his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out
Enter Input : of sorts altogether," he began in quite a different tone, laughing to
Enter Input : Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
Enter Input : Who got the best of it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated
Enter Input : off into space."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a
Enter Input : thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is there strange? It's an everyday social question," Raskolnikov
Enter Input : answered casually.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The question wasn't put quite like that," observed Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not quite, that's true," Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and
Enter Input : hurried as usual. "Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to
Enter Input : hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to
Enter Input : help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist
Enter Input : doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the
Enter Input : abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing
Enter Input : more; no other causes admitted!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are wrong there," cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably
Enter Input : animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him
Enter Input : more excited than ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing is admitted," Razumihin interrupted with heat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not wrong. I'll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them
Enter Input : is 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favourite
Enter Input : phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,
Enter Input : all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest
Enter Input : against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature
Enter Input : is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist!
Enter Input : They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living
Enter Input : process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a
Enter Input : social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going
Enter Input : to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an
Enter Input : instant, quicker than any living process! That's why they instinctively
Enter Input : dislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they
Enter Input : explain it all as stupidity! That's why they so dislike the _living_
Enter Input : process of life; they don't want a _living soul_! The living soul
Enter Input : demands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an
Enter Input : object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though
Enter Input : it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not
Enter Input : alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt! And it comes in the end
Enter Input : to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning
Enter Input : of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,
Enter Input : indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it
Enter Input : wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for the
Enter Input : graveyard! You can't skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three
Enter Input : possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce
Enter Input : it all to the question of comfort! That's the easiest solution of the
Enter Input : problem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it. That's
Enter Input : the great thing, you mustn't think! The whole secret of life in two
Enter Input : pages of print!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!" laughed
Enter Input : Porfiry. "Can you imagine," he turned to Raskolnikov, "six people
Enter Input : holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a
Enter Input : preliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a
Enter Input : great deal in crime; I can assure you of that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child
Enter Input : of ten; was it environment drove him to it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, strictly speaking, it did," Porfiry observed with noteworthy
Enter Input : gravity; "a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the
Enter Input : influence of environment."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. "Oh, if you like," he roared. "I'll
Enter Input : prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the
Enter Input : Church of Ivan the Great's being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I
Enter Input : will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal
Enter Input : tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Done! Let's hear, please, how he will prove it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is always humbugging, confound him," cried Razumihin, jumping up and
Enter Input : gesticulating. "What's the use of talking to you? He does all that
Enter Input : on purpose; you don't know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,
Enter Input : simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they
Enter Input : were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he
Enter Input : persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two
Enter Input : months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going
Enter Input : to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered
Enter Input : new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no
Enter Input : bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in
Enter Input : fact that made me think of taking you in."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you such a good dissembler?" Raskolnikov asked carelessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You wouldn't have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,
Enter Input : too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I'll tell you the truth. All these questions about
Enter Input : crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours
Enter Input : which interested me at the time. 'On Crime'... or something of the
Enter Input : sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the
Enter Input : _Periodical Review_."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My article? In the _Periodical Review_?" Raskolnikov asked in
Enter Input : astonishment. "I certainly did write an article upon a book six months
Enter Input : ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But it came out in the _Periodical_."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn't
Enter Input : printed at the time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was
Enter Input : amalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two
Enter Input : months ago in the latter. Didn't you know?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had not known.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a
Enter Input : strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know
Enter Input : nothing of matters that concern you directly. It's a fact, I assure
Enter Input : you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!" cried Razumihin. "I'll
Enter Input : run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?
Enter Input : What was the date? It doesn't matter though, I will find it. Think of
Enter Input : not telling us!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How did you find out that the article was mine? It's only signed with
Enter Input : an initial."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know
Enter Input : him.... I was very much interested."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and
Enter Input : after the crime."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always
Enter Input : accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part
Enter Input : of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of
Enter Input : the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working
Enter Input : it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are
Enter Input : certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have
Enter Input : a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the
Enter Input : law is not for them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his
Enter Input : idea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the
Enter Input : influence of environment?" Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not exactly because of it," answered Porfiry. "In his article all
Enter Input : men are divided into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary.' Ordinary men have
Enter Input : to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,
Enter Input : don't you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to
Enter Input : commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they
Enter Input : are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean? That can't be right?" Razumihin muttered in
Enter Input : bewilderment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they
Enter Input : wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That wasn't quite my contention," he began simply and modestly. "Yet
Enter Input : I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,
Enter Input : perfectly so." (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) "The only
Enter Input : difference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are always
Enter Input : bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt
Enter Input : whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an
Enter Input : 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, but
Enter Input : an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain
Enter Input : obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment
Enter Input : of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).
Enter Input : You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear
Enter Input : as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I
Enter Input : maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have
Enter Input : been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a
Enter Input : hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have
Enter Input : been in duty bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for
Enter Input : the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But
Enter Input : it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people
Enter Input : right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I
Enter Input : maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,
Enter Input : such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without
Enter Input : exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they
Enter Input : transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held
Enter Input : sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,
Enter Input : if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence
Enter Input : of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It's remarkable, in fact,
Enter Input : that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity
Enter Input : were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men
Enter Input : or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving
Enter Input : some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,
Enter Input : of course. Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut;
Enter Input : and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their
Enter Input : very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to
Enter Input : it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The
Enter Input : same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my
Enter Input : division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that
Enter Input : it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. I only
Enter Input : believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law
Enter Input : of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,
Enter Input : material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have
Enter Input : the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,
Enter Input : innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both
Enter Input : categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally
Enter Input : speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live
Enter Input : under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty
Enter Input : to be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothing
Enter Input : humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the
Enter Input : law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their
Enter Input : capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;
Enter Input : for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the
Enter Input : present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the
Enter Input : sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I
Enter Input : maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading
Enter Input : through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.
Enter Input : It's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article
Enter Input : (you remember it began with the legal question). There's no need for
Enter Input : such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,
Enter Input : they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil
Enter Input : quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these
Enter Input : criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or
Enter Input : less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second
Enter Input : the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the
Enter Input : second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal
Enter Input : right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la
Enter Input : guerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I do," Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during
Enter Input : the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I do," repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And... do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... I do. Why do you ask all this?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You believe it literally?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Literally."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us
Enter Input : go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the
Enter Input : contrary..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this
Enter Input : life, and then..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They begin executing other people?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is
Enter Input : very witty."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary
Enter Input : people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel
Enter Input : there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the
Enter Input : natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't they
Enter Input : adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn't they wear something, be
Enter Input : branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of
Enter Input : one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to 'eliminate
Enter Input : obstacles' as you so happily expressed it, then..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in
Enter Input : the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps
Enter Input : unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to
Enter Input : obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes
Enter Input : vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,
Enter Input : 'destroyers,' and to push themselves into the 'new movement,' and
Enter Input : this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often
Enter Input : unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling
Enter Input : tendencies. But I don't think there is any considerable danger here,
Enter Input : and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,
Enter Input : they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away
Enter Input : with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even
Enter Input : this isn't necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very
Enter Input : conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others
Enter Input : chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various
Enter Input : public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying
Enter Input : effect; in fact you've nothing to be uneasy about.... It's a law of
Enter Input : nature."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but
Enter Input : there's another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people
Enter Input : who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am
Enter Input : ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarming
Enter Input : if there are a great many of them, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, you needn't worry about that either," Raskolnikov went on in the
Enter Input : same tone. "People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for
Enter Input : saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily
Enter Input : so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these
Enter Input : grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity
Enter Input : some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am
Enter Input : convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of
Enter Input : mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,
Enter Input : by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and
Enter Input : stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a
Enter Input : thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I
Enter Input : speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with
Enter Input : still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius
Enter Input : is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,
Enter Input : appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have
Enter Input : not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there
Enter Input : certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of
Enter Input : chance."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, are you both joking?" Razumihin cried at last. "There you sit,
Enter Input : making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.
Enter Input : And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of
Enter Input : Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,
Enter Input : in saying that it's not new, that it's like what we've read and heard a
Enter Input : thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is
Enter Input : exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed
Enter Input : _in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such
Enter Input : fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that
Enter Input : sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible
Enter Input : than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are quite right, it is more terrible," Porfiry agreed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.
Enter Input : You can't think that! I shall read it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of it," said
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes." Porfiry couldn't sit still. "Your attitude to crime is
Enter Input : pretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am
Enter Input : really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you've removed
Enter Input : my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various
Enter Input : practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth
Enter Input : imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and
Enter Input : suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great
Enter Input : enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...
Enter Input : do you see?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even
Enter Input : raise his eyes to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must admit," he went on calmly, "that such cases certainly must
Enter Input : arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that
Enter Input : snare; young people especially."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you see. Well then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What then?" Raskolnikov smiled in reply; "that's not my fault. So it is
Enter Input : and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)
Enter Input : that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,
Enter Input : banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There's no need to
Enter Input : be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if we do catch him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then he gets what he deserves."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why do you care about that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Simply from humanity."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his
Enter Input : punishment--as well as the prison."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But the real geniuses," asked Razumihin frowning, "those who have
Enter Input : the right to murder? Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood
Enter Input : they've shed?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why the word _ought_? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition.
Enter Input : He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are
Enter Input : always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The
Enter Input : really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth," he added
Enter Input : dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his
Enter Input : cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and
Enter Input : he felt this. Everyone got up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like," Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch began again, "but I can't resist. Allow me one little
Enter Input : question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I
Enter Input : want to express, simply that I may not forget it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very good, tell me your little notion," Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale
Enter Input : and grave before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you see... I really don't know how to express it properly....
Enter Input : It's a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your
Enter Input : article, surely you couldn't have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...
Enter Input : just a little, an 'extraordinary' man, uttering a _new word_ in your
Enter Input : sense.... That's so, isn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite possibly," Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin made a movement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties
Enter Input : and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...
Enter Input : For instance, to rob and murder?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as
Enter Input : before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If I did I certainly should not tell you," Raskolnikov answered with
Enter Input : defiant and haughty contempt.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary
Enter Input : point of view..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!" Raskolnikov thought with
Enter Input : repulsion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me to observe," he answered dryly, "that I don't consider myself
Enter Input : a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being
Enter Input : one of them I cannot tell you how I should act."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, come, don't we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?"
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona
Enter Input : Ivanovna last week?" Zametov blurted out from the corner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.
Enter Input : Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing
Enter Input : something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy
Enter Input : silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you going already?" Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with
Enter Input : excessive politeness. "Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your
Enter Input : request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,
Enter Input : come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall
Enter Input : be there at eleven o'clock for certain. We'll arrange it all; we'll have
Enter Input : a talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to
Enter Input : tell us something," he added with a most good-natured expression.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?" Raskolnikov asked
Enter Input : sharply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, why? That's not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.
Enter Input : I lose no opportunity, you see, and... I've talked with all who had
Enter Input : pledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the
Enter Input : last.... Yes, by the way," he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, "I
Enter Input : just remember, what was I thinking of?" he turned to Razumihin, "you
Enter Input : were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know
Enter Input : very well," he turned to Raskolnikov, "that the fellow is innocent, but
Enter Input : what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,
Enter Input : this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very
Enter Input : moment he spoke that he need not have said it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn't you see in
Enter Input : a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen
Enter Input : or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn't you notice
Enter Input : them? It's very, very important for them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Painters? No, I didn't see them," Raskolnikov answered slowly, as
Enter Input : though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking
Enter Input : every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as
Enter Input : possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. "No, I didn't
Enter Input : see them, and I don't think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on
Enter Input : the fourth storey" (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)
Enter Input : "I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona
Enter Input : Ivanovna's.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters
Enter Input : were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But
Enter Input : painters... no, I don't remember that there were any painters, and I
Enter Input : don't think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn't."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean?" Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had
Enter Input : reflected and realised. "Why, it was on the day of the murder the
Enter Input : painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you
Enter Input : asking?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Foo! I have muddled it!" Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.
Enter Input : "Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!" he addressed
Enter Input : Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. "It would be such a great thing for
Enter Input : us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at
Enter Input : the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I
Enter Input : quite muddled it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you should be more careful," Razumihin observed grimly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them
Enter Input : to the door with excessive politeness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they
Enter Input : did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't believe it, I can't believe it!" repeated Razumihin, trying in
Enter Input : perplexity to refute Raskolnikov's arguments.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were by now approaching Bakaleyev's lodgings, where Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin
Enter Input : kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited
Enter Input : by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about
Enter Input : _it_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't believe it, then!" answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless
Enter Input : smile. "You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every
Enter Input : word."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h'm...
Enter Input : certainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather strange, and still
Enter Input : more that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about
Enter Input : him--but why? Why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has changed his mind since last night."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do
Enter Input : their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you
Enter Input : afterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for
Enter Input : suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,
Enter Input : in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago
Enter Input : besides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all
Enter Input : ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by
Enter Input : impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted
Enter Input : it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
Enter Input : intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to
Enter Input : know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome
Enter Input : explaining it all. Stop!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And it's insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have
Enter Input : spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I
Enter Input : am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,
Enter Input : this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an
Enter Input : insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you
Enter Input : knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,
Enter Input : unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious
Enter Input : illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to
Enter Input : speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to
Enter Input : face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and
Enter Input : the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented
Enter Input : by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling
Enter Input : atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person
Enter Input : where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he
Enter Input : might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it
Enter Input : all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,
Enter Input : Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,
Enter Input : and spit a dozen times in all directions. I'd hit out in all
Enter Input : directions, neatly too, and so I'd put an end to it. Damn them! Don't be
Enter Input : downhearted. It's a shame!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He really has put it well, though," Raskolnikov thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?" he said with
Enter Input : bitterness. "Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel
Enter Input : vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the
Enter Input : restaurant...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as
Enter Input : one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And
Enter Input : as for Zametov..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At last he sees through him!" thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stay!" cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. "Stay! you
Enter Input : were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?
Enter Input : You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had
Enter Input : done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...
Enter Input : and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if
Enter Input : you had seen it. Who would own it against himself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had
Enter Input : seen the workmen and the flat," Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance
Enter Input : and obvious disgust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But why speak against yourself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny
Enter Input : everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed
Enter Input : and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts
Enter Input : that can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will
Enter Input : introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another
Enter Input : significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon
Enter Input : that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an
Enter Input : air of truth, and then make some explanation."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been
Enter Input : there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on
Enter Input : the day of the murder at eight o'clock. And so he would have caught you
Enter Input : over a detail."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to
Enter Input : reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and
Enter Input : so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days
Enter Input : before."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how could you forget it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most
Enter Input : easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he
Enter Input : will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler
Enter Input : the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you
Enter Input : think...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is a knave then, if that is so!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was
Enter Input : struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness
Enter Input : with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the
Enter Input : preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,
Enter Input : from necessity.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am getting a relish for certain aspects!" he thought to himself.
Enter Input : But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an
Enter Input : unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on
Enter Input : increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go in alone!" said Raskolnikov suddenly. "I will be back directly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are you going? Why, we are just here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Say what you like, I will come with you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You, too, want to torture me!" he screamed, with such bitter
Enter Input : irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin's hands dropped.
Enter Input : He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov
Enter Input : striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting
Enter Input : his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry
Enter Input : like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was
Enter Input : breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his
Enter Input : unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror
Enter Input : he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put
Enter Input : the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the
Enter Input : hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up
Enter Input : and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, he
Enter Input : suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper
Enter Input : in which they had been wrapped with the old woman's handwriting on it,
Enter Input : might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then
Enter Input : might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half
Enter Input : senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went
Enter Input : quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily
Enter Input : through the gateway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here he is himself," shouted a loud voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He raised his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing
Enter Input : him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat
Enter Input : and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He
Enter Input : stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled
Enter Input : flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and
Enter Input : they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him
Enter Input : attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the
Enter Input : gate into the street without saying a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your
Enter Input : name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and
Enter Input : he went away. It's funny."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after
Enter Input : wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of
Enter Input : him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,
Enter Input : deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in
Enter Input : meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.
Enter Input : At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man
Enter Input : noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;
Enter Input : and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You were inquiring for me... of the porter?" Raskolnikov said at last,
Enter Input : but in a curiously quiet voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man made no answer; he didn't even look at him. Again they were both
Enter Input : silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What's the
Enter Input : meaning of it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words
Enter Input : clearly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Murderer!" he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a
Enter Input : cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for
Enter Input : a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So
Enter Input : they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man did not look at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?" muttered
Enter Input : Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_You_ are a murderer," the man answered still more articulately and
Enter Input : emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked
Enter Input : straight into Raskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left
Enter Input : without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after
Enter Input : him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still
Enter Input : standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that
Enter Input : he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way
Enter Input : back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap
Enter Input : and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
Enter Input : Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
Enter Input : stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some
Enter Input : images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of
Enter Input : people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would
Enter Input : never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table
Enter Input : in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars
Enter Input : in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite
Enter Input : dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the
Enter Input : Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one
Enter Input : another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried
Enter Input : to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression
Enter Input : within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even
Enter Input : pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too
Enter Input : was an almost pleasant sensation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and
Enter Input : pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some
Enter Input : time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into
Enter Input : the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya's
Enter Input : whisper:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so," answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the
Enter Input : door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on
Enter Input : his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,
Enter Input : what did he see? He has seen it all, that's clear. Where was he then?
Enter Input : And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?
Enter Input : And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm..." continued Raskolnikov,
Enter Input : turning cold and shivering, "and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the
Enter Input : door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you
Enter Input : can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it
Enter Input : possible?" He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he
Enter Input : had become. "I ought to have known it," he thought with a bitter smile.
Enter Input : "And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an
Enter Input : axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did
Enter Input : know!" he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is
Enter Input : permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in
Enter Input : Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off
Enter Input : with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and
Enter Input : so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but
Enter Input : of bronze!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the
Enter Input : pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with
Enter Input : a red trunk under her bed--it's a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to
Enter Input : digest! How can they digest it! It's too inartistic. "A Napoleon creep
Enter Input : under an old woman's bed! Ugh, how loathsome!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish
Enter Input : excitement. "The old woman is of no consequence," he thought, hotly and
Enter Input : incoherently. "The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not
Enter Input : what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to
Enter Input : overstep.... I didn't kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the
Enter Input : principle, but I didn't overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was
Enter Input : only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn't even capable of that...
Enter Input : Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are
Enter Input : industrious, commercial people; 'the happiness of all' is their case.
Enter Input : No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I
Enter Input : don't want to wait for 'the happiness of all.' I want to live myself,
Enter Input : or else better not live at all. I simply couldn't pass by my mother
Enter Input : starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the
Enter Input : 'happiness of all.' I am putting my little brick into the happiness of
Enter Input : all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only
Enter Input : live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing
Enter Input : more," he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. "Yes, I am certainly a
Enter Input : louse," he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing
Enter Input : with it with vindictive pleasure. "In the first place, because I can
Enter Input : reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been
Enter Input : troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for
Enter Input : my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble
Enter Input : object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as
Enter Input : possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked
Enter Input : out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I
Enter Input : needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone
Enter Input : to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I
Enter Input : am utterly a louse," he added, grinding his teeth, "is that I am
Enter Input : perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt
Enter Input : beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can
Enter Input : anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The
Enter Input : abjectness! I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed:
Enter Input : Allah commands and 'trembling' creation must obey! The 'prophet' is
Enter Input : right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up
Enter Input : the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It's for you to
Enter Input : obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that's not for
Enter Input : you!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his
Enter Input : eyes were fixed on the ceiling.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate
Enter Input : them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....
Enter Input : I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her
Enter Input : and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That's just what
Enter Input : I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am," he added, straining
Enter Input : himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. "Ah, how I hate
Enter Input : the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!
Enter Input : Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It's strange though, why is it
Enter Input : I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn't killed her? Lizaveta!
Enter Input : Sonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don't
Enter Input : they weep? Why don't they moan? They give up everything... their eyes
Enter Input : are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn't remember
Enter Input : how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen
Enter Input : and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a
Enter Input : peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the
Enter Input : street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other
Enter Input : people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and
Enter Input : stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was
Enter Input : distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do
Enter Input : something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he
Enter Input : stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,
Enter Input : beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and
Enter Input : walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to
Enter Input : him. "Stay, did he really beckon?" Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried
Enter Input : to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and
Enter Input : was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long
Enter Input : coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;
Enter Input : they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. "Does he
Enter Input : know I am following him?" thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the
Enter Input : gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in
Enter Input : to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard
Enter Input : the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at
Enter Input : once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have
Enter Input : gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard
Enter Input : slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely
Enter Input : familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone
Enter Input : through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he
Enter Input : reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were
Enter Input : at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps
Enter Input : of the man above had died away. "So he must have stopped or hidden
Enter Input : somewhere." He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a
Enter Input : stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own
Enter Input : footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be
Enter Input : hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he
Enter Input : hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as
Enter Input : though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour
Enter Input : which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the
Enter Input : chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the
Enter Input : frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
Enter Input : "It's the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery," thought
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more
Enter Input : silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was
Enter Input : painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp
Enter Input : crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly
Enter Input : flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At
Enter Input : that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little
Enter Input : cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. "Why is that cloak
Enter Input : here?" he thought, "it wasn't there before...." He went up to it quietly
Enter Input : and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved
Enter Input : the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent
Enter Input : double so that he couldn't see her face; but it was she. He stood over
Enter Input : her. "She is afraid," he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the
Enter Input : noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange
Enter Input : to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was
Enter Input : frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,
Enter Input : bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up
Enter Input : into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old
Enter Input : woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing
Enter Input : her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door
Enter Input : from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and
Enter Input : whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the
Enter Input : old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe
Enter Input : the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old
Enter Input : woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the
Enter Input : passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the
Enter Input : landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of
Enter Input : heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.
Enter Input : Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they
Enter Input : would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:
Enter Input : his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the
Enter Input : doorway watching him intently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them
Enter Input : again. He lay on his back without stirring.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it still a dream?" he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly
Enter Input : perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after
Enter Input : him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he
Enter Input : put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane
Enter Input : and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait
Enter Input : indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen
Enter Input : glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost
Enter Input : whitish beard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There
Enter Input : was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.
Enter Input : Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was
Enter Input : unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, tell me what you want."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending," the stranger answered
Enter Input : oddly, laughing calmly. "Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to
Enter Input : introduce myself...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : PART IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Can this be still a dream?" Raskolnikov thought once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can't be!" he said at last aloud in
Enter Input : bewilderment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make
Enter Input : your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about
Enter Input : you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope
Enter Input : that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the
Enter Input : welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she
Enter Input : might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,
Enter Input : but with your assistance I reckon on..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You reckon wrongly," interrupted Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov made no reply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,
Enter Input : let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don't consider it necessary
Enter Input : to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly
Enter Input : criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,
Enter Input : with common sense?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 'insulted her
Enter Input : with my infamous proposals'--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But
Enter Input : you've only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a
Enter Input : word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which
Enter Input : does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the
Enter Input : most natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself
Enter Input : a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my
Enter Input : passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished
Enter Input : the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting
Enter Input : our mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,
Enter Input : probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But that's not the point," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. "It's
Enter Input : simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don't
Enter Input : want to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you're... but there's no getting round you," he said, laughing in
Enter Input : the frankest way. "I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right
Enter Input : line at once!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you are trying to get round me still!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What of it? What of it?" cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. "But this
Enter Input : is what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of
Enter Input : deception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I
Enter Input : repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for
Enter Input : what happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?" Raskolnikov
Enter Input : interrupted rudely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, you've heard that, too, then? You'd be sure to, though.... But
Enter Input : as for your question, I really don't know what to say, though my own
Enter Input : conscience is quite at rest on that score. Don't suppose that I am in
Enter Input : any apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical
Enter Input : inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy
Enter Input : dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing
Enter Input : else. But I'll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on
Enter Input : my way here in the train, especially: didn't I contribute to all that...
Enter Input : calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the
Enter Input : sort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the
Enter Input : question."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov laughed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I wonder you trouble yourself about it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice
Enter Input : with a switch--there were no marks even... don't regard me as a cynic,
Enter Input : please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;
Enter Input : but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased
Enter Input : at my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to
Enter Input : the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to
Enter Input : sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,
Enter Input : she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the
Enter Input : letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her
Enter Input : first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak
Enter Input : of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be
Enter Input : insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances
Enter Input : of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to
Enter Input : be insulted, have you noticed that? But it's particularly so with women.
Enter Input : One might even say it's their only amusement."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so
Enter Input : finishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence
Enter Input : made him linger for a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are fond of fighting?" he asked carelessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not very," Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. "And Marfa Petrovna and
Enter Input : I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always
Enter Input : pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not
Enter Input : counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first
Enter Input : time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the
Enter Input : country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you
Enter Input : suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?
Enter Input : Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years
Enter Input : ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I've forgotten
Enter Input : his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having
Enter Input : thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in
Enter Input : those days, that very year I believe, the 'disgraceful action of the
Enter Input : _Age_' took place (you know, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading,
Enter Input : you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,
Enter Input : where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,
Enter Input : I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there
Enter Input : for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking
Enter Input : 'Germans' that I don't believe there is a progressive who could quite
Enter Input : answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view
Enter Input : then, but that's the truly humane point of view, I assure you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his
Enter Input : mind and able to keep it to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I expect you've not talked to anyone for some days?" he asked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an
Enter Input : adaptable man?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that
Enter Input : it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered," he replied,
Enter Input : with a surprising expression of simplicity. "You know, there's
Enter Input : hardly anything I take interest in," he went on, as it were dreamily,
Enter Input : "especially now, I've nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to
Enter Input : imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as
Enter Input : I told you I want to see your sister about something. But I'll confess
Enter Input : frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am
Enter Input : delighted to see you.... Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you
Enter Input : seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there's
Enter Input : something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,
Enter Input : but now, generally.... Well, well, I won't, I won't, don't scowl! I am
Enter Input : not such a bear, you know, as you think."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are not a bear, perhaps, at all," he said. "I fancy indeed that
Enter Input : you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to
Enter Input : behave like one."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion," Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, "and therefore why
Enter Input : not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our
Enter Input : climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way," he
Enter Input : added, laughing again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I've heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, 'not
Enter Input : without connections.' What can you want with me, then, unless you've
Enter Input : some special object?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's true that I have friends here," Svidrigaïlov admitted, not
Enter Input : replying to the chief point. "I've met some already. I've been lounging
Enter Input : about for the last three days, and I've seen them, or they've seen me.
Enter Input : That's a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor
Enter Input : man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn't affected me; my property
Enter Input : consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not
Enter Input : fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long
Enter Input : ago. I've been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town
Enter Input : it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of
Enter Input : officials and students of all sorts. Yes, there's a great deal I didn't
Enter Input : notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only
Enter Input : hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Anatomy?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,
Enter Input : maybe--well, all that can go on without me," he went on, again without
Enter Input : noticing the question. "Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, have you been a card-sharper then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best
Enter Input : society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,
Enter Input : you know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian
Enter Input : society the best manners are found among those who've been thrashed,
Enter Input : have you noticed that? I've deteriorated in the country. But I did get
Enter Input : into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for
Enter Input : thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united
Enter Input : in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.
Enter Input : You know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For
Enter Input : seven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life
Enter Input : she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so
Enter Input : if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at
Enter Input : once! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in
Enter Input : that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If it hadn't been for that, would you have given her the slip?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I
Enter Input : didn't want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go
Enter Input : abroad, seeing I was bored, but I've been abroad before, and always
Enter Input : felt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the
Enter Input : sea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What's most revolting is
Enter Input : that one is really sad! No, it's better at home. Here at least one
Enter Input : blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone
Enter Input : perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j'ai le vin
Enter Input : mauvais_ and hate drinking, and there's nothing left but wine. I have
Enter Input : tried it. But, I say, I've been told Berg is going up in a great balloon
Enter Input : next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a
Enter Input : fee. Is it true?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, would you go up?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... No, oh, no," muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What does he mean? Is he in earnest?" Raskolnikov wondered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, the document didn't restrain me," Svidrigaïlov went on,
Enter Input : meditatively. "It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly
Enter Input : a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day
Enter Input : and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a
Enter Input : fortune, you know. 'You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch'--that
Enter Input : was actually her expression. You don't believe she used it? But do
Enter Input : you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the
Enter Input : neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,
Enter Input : but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you
Enter Input : believe in ghosts?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What ghosts?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, ordinary ghosts."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you believe in them?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn't say no exactly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you see them, then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me," he said, twisting his mouth
Enter Input : into a strange smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you mean 'she is pleased to visit you'?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the
Enter Input : funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to
Enter Input : come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on
Enter Input : the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two
Enter Input : hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Were you awake?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for
Enter Input : a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear
Enter Input : her."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to
Enter Input : you?" Raskolnikov said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much
Enter Input : excited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! Did you think so?" Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. "Did you
Enter Input : really? Didn't I say that there was something in common between us, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You never said so!" Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Didn't I?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,
Enter Input : pretending, I said to myself at once, 'Here's the man.'"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean by 'the man?' What are you talking about?" cried
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do I mean? I really don't know...." Svidrigaïlov muttered
Enter Input : ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other's faces.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all nonsense!" Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. "What does she
Enter Input : say when she comes to you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man
Enter Input : is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I
Enter Input : was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch
Enter Input : afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and
Enter Input : began to think), she came in at the door. 'You've been so busy to-day,
Enter Input : Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,'
Enter Input : she said. All those seven years I've wound that clock every week, and if
Enter Input : I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way
Enter Input : here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out,
Enter Input : with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and
Enter Input : there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of
Enter Input : cards in her hands. 'Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady
Enter Input : Ivanovitch?' She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never
Enter Input : forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,
Enter Input : besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a
Enter Input : miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress
Enter Input : with a long train. 'Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my
Enter Input : dress? Aniska can't make like this.' (Aniska was a dressmaker in the
Enter Input : country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a
Enter Input : pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,
Enter Input : and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. 'I wonder
Enter Input : you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.' 'Good
Enter Input : gracious, you won't let one disturb you about anything!' To tease her
Enter Input : I said, 'I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.' 'That's just like you,
Enter Input : Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a
Enter Input : bride when you've hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good
Enter Input : choice, at least, but I know it won't be for your happiness or hers, you
Enter Input : will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.' Then she went out and
Enter Input : her train seemed to rustle. Isn't it nonsense, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But perhaps you are telling lies?" Raskolnikov put in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I rarely lie," answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not
Enter Input : noticing the rudeness of the question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had
Enter Input : a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting 'Filka, my
Enter Input : pipe!' He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat
Enter Input : still and thought 'he is doing it out of revenge,' because we had a
Enter Input : violent quarrel just before his death. 'How dare you come in with a hole
Enter Input : in your elbow?' I said. 'Go away, you scamp!' He turned and went out,
Enter Input : and never came again. I didn't tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted
Enter Input : to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You should go to a doctor."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don't know
Enter Input : what's wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn't
Enter Input : ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you
Enter Input : believe that they exist."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I won't believe it!" Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do people generally say?" muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though
Enter Input : speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. "They say, 'You
Enter Input : are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.' But that's not
Enter Input : strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that
Enter Input : only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that
Enter Input : they don't exist."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing of the sort," Raskolnikov insisted irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No? You don't think so?" Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him
Enter Input : deliberately. "But what do you say to this argument (help me with
Enter Input : it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the
Enter Input : beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see
Enter Input : them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the
Enter Input : sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon
Enter Input : as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is
Enter Input : broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the
Enter Input : more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with that
Enter Input : other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that
Enter Input : world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you
Enter Input : could believe in that, too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't believe in a future life," said Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,"
Enter Input : he said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is a madman," thought Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,
Enter Input : something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what
Enter Input : if it's one little room, like a bath house in the country, black
Enter Input : and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is? I
Enter Input : sometimes fancy it like that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than
Enter Input : that?" Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know
Enter Input : it's what I would certainly have made it," answered Svidrigaïlov, with a
Enter Input : vague smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only think," he cried, "half an hour ago we had never seen each other,
Enter Input : we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between
Enter Input : us; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone into the abstract! Wasn't
Enter Input : I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Kindly allow me," Raskolnikov went on irritably, "to ask you to explain
Enter Input : why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,
Enter Input : I have no time to waste. I want to go out."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to
Enter Input : be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning
Enter Input : her name? I can't understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,
Enter Input : if you really are Svidrigaïlov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, but I've come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning
Enter Input : her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very good, speak, but make haste."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.
Enter Input : Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only
Enter Input : seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no
Enter Input : match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing
Enter Input : herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of
Enter Input : her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very
Enter Input : glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly
Enter Input : advantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on
Enter Input : your part," said Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don't be uneasy, Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have
Enter Input : spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something
Enter Input : psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you
Enter Input : that I've no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder
Enter Input : myself indeed, for I really did feel something..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Through idleness and depravity," Raskolnikov put in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities
Enter Input : that even I could not help being impressed by them. But that's all
Enter Input : nonsense, as I see myself now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you seen that long?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the
Enter Input : day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I
Enter Input : still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna's hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object
Enter Input : of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a
Enter Input : certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary
Enter Input : arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided
Enter Input : for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should
Enter Input : make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year
Enter Input : ago. That's enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.
Enter Input : Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.
Enter Input : It's not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled
Enter Input : with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.
Enter Input : I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you
Enter Input : like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she
Enter Input : will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging
Enter Input : her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten
Enter Input : thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to
Enter Input : which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way
Enter Input : to it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are certainly mad," cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as
Enter Input : astonished. "How dare you talk like that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not
Enter Input : rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no
Enter Input : need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste
Enter Input : it in some more foolish way. That's the first thing. Secondly, my
Enter Input : conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.
Enter Input : You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will
Enter Input : know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I
Enter Input : greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely
Enter Input : regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the
Enter Input : unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show
Enter Input : that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there
Enter Input : were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not
Enter Input : have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand
Enter Input : only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,
Enter Input : very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion
Enter Input : of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that
Enter Input : in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from
Enter Input : another man. Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly
Enter Input : and quietly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying
Enter Input : this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I beg you to say no more," said Raskolnikov. "In any case this is
Enter Input : unpardonable impertinence."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour
Enter Input : in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good
Enter Input : by trivial conventional formalities. That's absurd. If I died, for
Enter Input : instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she
Enter Input : wouldn't refuse it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very likely she would."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten
Enter Input : thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I
Enter Input : beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I won't."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her
Enter Input : myself and worry her by doing so."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know really what to say. I should like very much to see her
Enter Input : once more."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't hope for it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm sorry. But you don't know me. Perhaps we may become better
Enter Input : friends."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You think we may become friends?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And why not?" Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.
Enter Input : "I didn't quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning
Enter Input : on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where did you see me this morning?" Raskolnikov asked uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you
Enter Input : like me.... But don't be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on
Enter Input : all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great
Enter Input : personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about
Enter Input : Raphael's _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov's album, and I never left Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna's side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at
Enter Input : Viazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in
Enter Input : a balloon with Berg, perhaps."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What travels?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, on that 'journey'; you spoke of it yourself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that's a wide
Enter Input : subject.... if only you knew what you are asking," he added, and gave
Enter Input : a sudden, loud, short laugh. "Perhaps I'll get married instead of the
Enter Input : journey. They're making a match for me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How have you had time for that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg
Enter Input : it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.
Enter Input : Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered
Enter Input : her in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That's absolutely
Enter Input : certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was
Enter Input : done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money
Enter Input : in two or three weeks."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you telling the truth?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's,
Enter Input : to arrive before Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, who was that?" asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the
Enter Input : street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was
Enter Input : insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with
Enter Input : his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she's just
Enter Input : died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don't
Enter Input : know why I'm afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife's
Enter Input : funeral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We
Enter Input : must guard Dounia from him... that's what I wanted to tell you, do you
Enter Input : hear?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,
Enter Input : for speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does
Enter Input : he live?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why didn't you ask? What a pity! I'll find out, though."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you see him?" asked Raskolnikov after a pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You did really see him? You saw him clearly?" Raskolnikov insisted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have
Enter Input : a good memory for faces."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were silent again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hm!... that's all right," muttered Raskolnikov. "Do you know, I
Enter Input : fancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean? I don't understand you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you all say," Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a
Enter Input : smile, "that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,
Enter Input : and have only seen a phantom."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that
Enter Input : happened all these days may be only imagination."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did
Enter Input : he come for?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now let me tell you my story," he began, "I came to you, you were
Enter Input : asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's, Zametov was
Enter Input : still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn't speak in
Enter Input : the right way. They don't seem to understand and can't understand, but
Enter Input : are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking
Enter Input : to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At
Enter Input : last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'd
Enter Input : brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was
Enter Input : all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn't say a word. But, you see, I
Enter Input : thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea
Enter Input : struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger
Enter Input : or anything, but why need you care? You needn't care a hang for them. We
Enter Input : shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd
Enter Input : mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they'll be afterwards! Hang
Enter Input : them! We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To be sure," answered Raskolnikov. "But what will you say to-morrow?"
Enter Input : he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never
Enter Input : occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he
Enter Input : thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin's account of his visit
Enter Input : to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone
Enter Input : since then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually
Enter Input : at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in
Enter Input : together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men
Enter Input : walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a
Enter Input : little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came
Enter Input : forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her
Enter Input : brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with
Enter Input : redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though
Enter Input : he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make
Enter Input : them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia
Enter Input : and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
Enter Input : Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin
Enter Input : was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A moment's silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a
Enter Input : cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of
Enter Input : a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to
Enter Input : insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to
Enter Input : keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp
Enter Input : and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
Enter Input : But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure
Enter Input : uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so
Enter Input : openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was
Enter Input : better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and
Enter Input : there would always be time for that.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I trust you had a favourable journey," he inquired officially of
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued
Enter Input : either?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain for
Enter Input : mother," answered Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.
Enter Input : 'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my
Enter Input : desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all
Enter Input : passed off without inconvenience?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening," Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, "and if
Enter Input : Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,
Enter Input : we should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch
Enter Input : Razumihin," she added, introducing him to Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I had the pleasure... yesterday," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a
Enter Input : hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very
Enter Input : polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,
Enter Input : directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and
Enter Input : become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
Enter Input : Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had
Enter Input : nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?" she began having recourse to
Enter Input : her leading item of conversation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to
Enter Input : make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife's funeral. So
Enter Input : at least I have excellent authority for believing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To Petersburg? here?" Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the
Enter Input : rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! won't he leave Dounia in peace even here?" cried
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for
Enter Input : uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting
Enter Input : into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now
Enter Input : discovering where he is lodging."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have
Enter Input : given me," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: "I've only seen him twice,
Enter Input : but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the
Enter Input : cause of Marfa Petrovna's death."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I
Enter Input : do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of
Enter Input : events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the
Enter Input : general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am
Enter Input : in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and
Enter Input : precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within
Enter Input : a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any
Enter Input : pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is
Enter Input : the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.
Enter Input : I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so
Enter Input : unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years
Enter Input : ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions
Enter Input : and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic
Enter Input : and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to
Enter Input : Siberia, was hushed up. That's the sort of man he is, if you care to
Enter Input : know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened
Enter Input : attentively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of
Enter Input : this?" Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must
Enter Input : observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
Enter Input : There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,
Enter Input : a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other
Enter Input : commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close
Enter Input : and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living
Enter Input : with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than
Enter Input : fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she
Enter Input : used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in
Enter Input : the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual
Enter Input : proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that
Enter Input : the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this
Enter Input : was not clearly established, the information was given by another German
Enter Input : woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement
Enter Input : was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money and
Enter Input : exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very
Enter Input : significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were
Enter Input : with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he
Enter Input : received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,
Enter Input : to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know that," answered Dounia, dryly. "I only heard a queer story
Enter Input : that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,
Enter Input : the servants used to say, 'he read himself silly,' and that he hanged
Enter Input : himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov's mockery of him and not
Enter Input : his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they
Enter Input : were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for
Enter Input : Philip's death."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his
Enter Input : defence all of a sudden," Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into
Enter Input : an ambiguous smile, "there's no doubt that he is an astute man, and
Enter Input : insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has
Enter Input : died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be
Enter Input : of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed
Enter Input : efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it's
Enter Input : my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison again.
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything
Enter Input : substantial on him, having regard for his children's interests, and,
Enter Input : if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,
Enter Input : something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a
Enter Input : man of his habits."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you," said Dounia, "say no more of Mr.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has just been to see me," said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for
Enter Input : the first time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch was roused.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and
Enter Input : introduced himself," Raskolnikov continued. "He was fairly cheerful
Enter Input : and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is
Enter Input : particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at
Enter Input : which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and
Enter Input : he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that
Enter Input : you can receive the money very shortly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. "Pray for
Enter Input : her soul, Dounia!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a fact!" broke from Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell us, what more?" Dounia urged Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then he said that he wasn't rich and all the estate was left to his
Enter Input : children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere
Enter Input : not far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?" cried Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna in a fright. "Did he tell you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What was it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'll tell you afterwards."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in
Enter Input : your way," he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch," said Dounia, "you intended to spend
Enter Input : the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an
Enter Input : explanation with mother."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna," Pyotr Petrovitch answered
Enter Input : impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. "I
Enter Input : certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon
Enter Input : a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly
Enter Input : in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not
Enter Input : desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...
Enter Input : of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty
Enter Input : and urgent request has been disregarded...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was
Enter Input : disregarded solely at my instance," said Dounia. "You wrote that you
Enter Input : had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at
Enter Input : once, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,
Enter Input : then he _should_ and _will_ apologise."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us
Enter Input : forget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;
Enter Input : and when it has been overstepped, there is no return."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia
Enter Input : interrupted with some impatience. "Please understand that our whole
Enter Input : future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as
Enter Input : soon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at
Enter Input : it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this
Enter Input : business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that
Enter Input : if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am surprised at your putting the question like that," said Luzhin,
Enter Input : getting more and more irritated. "Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,
Enter Input : I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member
Enter Input : of your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I
Enter Input : cannot accept duties incompatible with..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia
Enter Input : interrupted with feeling, "and be the sensible and generous man I have
Enter Input : always considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I've given you a
Enter Input : great promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe
Enter Input : me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of
Enter Input : judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted
Enter Input : on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told
Enter Input : him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not
Enter Input : reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That
Enter Input : is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don't want to be
Enter Input : mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off
Enter Input : with my brother, for my brother's sake I must break off with you. I can
Enter Input : find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to
Enter Input : know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,
Enter Input : whether you are the husband for me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Avdotya Romanovna," Luzhin declared huffily, "your words are of too
Enter Input : much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view
Enter Input : of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say
Enter Input : nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an
Enter Input : impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to
Enter Input : me. You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence I
Enter Input : am in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship
Enter Input : and... the obligations existing between us."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What!" cried Dounia, flushing. "I set your interest beside all that has
Enter Input : hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of
Enter Input : my life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of
Enter Input : you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he
Enter Input : became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to
Enter Input : outweigh your love for your brother," he pronounced sententiously, "and
Enter Input : in any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so
Enter Input : emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother's presence,
Enter Input : nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary
Enter Input : explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.
Enter Input : Your son," he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "yesterday in the
Enter Input : presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that's it? excuse me I have
Enter Input : forgotten your surname," he bowed politely to Razumihin) "insulted me by
Enter Input : misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,
Enter Input : drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had
Enter Input : experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of
Enter Input : view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable
Enter Input : for the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the
Enter Input : significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of
Enter Input : malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your
Enter Input : correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite
Enter Input : conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know
Enter Input : in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't remember," faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I repeated them as
Enter Input : I understood them. I don't know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps
Enter Input : he exaggerated."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pyotr Petrovitch," Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, "the
Enter Input : proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is
Enter Input : the fact that we are here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good, mother," said Dounia approvingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then this is my fault again," said Luzhin, aggrieved.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have
Enter Input : just written what was false about him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,
Enter Input : gaining courage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't remember writing anything false."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You wrote," Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, "that I
Enter Input : gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was
Enter Input : the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).
Enter Input : You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that
Enter Input : object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you
Enter Input : don't know. All that is mean slander."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, quivering with fury. "I enlarged upon
Enter Input : your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your
Enter Input : sister's and mother's inquiries, how I found you, and what impression
Enter Input : you made on me. As for what you've alluded to in my letter, be so good
Enter Input : as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn't
Enter Input : throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that
Enter Input : family, however unfortunate."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little
Enter Input : finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and
Enter Input : sister?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day
Enter Input : with mother and Dounia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin
Enter Input : knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna," he said, "whether it is
Enter Input : possible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,
Enter Input : once and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures
Enter Input : of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets." He got up from his
Enter Input : chair and took his hat. "But in withdrawing, I venture to request
Enter Input : that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to
Enter Input : say, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to
Enter Input : you and to no one else."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,
Enter Input : she had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were
Enter Input : laying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as
Enter Input : a command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show
Enter Input : particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown
Enter Input : up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any
Enter Input : case in a sense in your hands."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the
Enter Input : present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna's legacy, which
Enter Input : seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me," he
Enter Input : added sarcastically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were
Enter Input : reckoning on our helplessness," Dounia observed irritably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire
Enter Input : not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady
Enter Input : Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and
Enter Input : which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest
Enter Input : for you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aren't you ashamed now, sister?" asked Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am ashamed, Rodya," said Dounia. "Pyotr Petrovitch, go away," she
Enter Input : turned to him, white with anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
Enter Input : He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the
Enter Input : helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned
Enter Input : pale, and his lips quivered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a
Enter Input : dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider
Enter Input : what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What insolence!" cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. "I don't
Enter Input : want you to come back again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! So that's how it stands!" cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the
Enter Input : last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of
Enter Input : his reckoning now. "So that's how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna, that I might protest?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What right have you to speak to her like that?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : intervened hotly. "And what can you protest about? What rights have you?
Enter Input : Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!
Enter Input : We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above
Enter Input : all...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna," Luzhin stormed in a
Enter Input : frenzy, "by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have
Enter Input : been led on account of that into expenses...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,
Enter Input : could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
Enter Input : furious.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the
Enter Input : conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound
Enter Input : you! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,
Enter Input : hand and foot, not we!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Enough, mother, no more please," Avdotya Romanovna implored. "Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch, do be kind and go!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am going, but one last word," he said, quite unable to control
Enter Input : himself. "Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my
Enter Input : mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread
Enter Input : all over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public
Enter Input : opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly
Enter Input : might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for
Enter Input : gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see
Enter Input : myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the
Enter Input : universal verdict...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Does the fellow want his head smashed?" cried Razumihin, jumping up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a mean and spiteful man!" cried Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not a word! Not a movement!" cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;
Enter Input : then going close up to Luzhin, "Kindly leave the room!" he said quietly
Enter Input : and distinctly, "and not a word more or..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that
Enter Input : worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man
Enter Input : carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is
Enter Input : noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case
Enter Input : was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were
Enter Input : concerned, all might "very well indeed" be set right again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an
Enter Input : ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that
Enter Input : two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This
Enter Input : conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to
Enter Input : the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from
Enter Input : insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest
Enter Input : opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated
Enter Input : in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued
Enter Input : above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts
Enter Input : of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his
Enter Input : superiors.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in
Enter Input : spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity
Enter Input : and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such "black ingratitude."
Enter Input : And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the
Enter Input : groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere
Enter Input : contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the
Enter Input : townspeople, who were warm in Dounia'a defence. And he would not have
Enter Input : denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly
Enter Input : of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as
Enter Input : something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret
Enter Input : feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that
Enter Input : others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with
Enter Input : the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good
Enter Input : deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he
Enter Input : considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
Enter Input : For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had
Enter Input : gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound
Enter Input : secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),
Enter Input : very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one
Enter Input : who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who
Enter Input : would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him
Enter Input : and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined
Enter Input : on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,
Enter Input : behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and
Enter Input : education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position
Enter Input : had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he
Enter Input : dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education
Enter Input : and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would
Enter Input : be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and
Enter Input : would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,
Enter Input : unbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long
Enter Input : reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and
Enter Input : was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his
Enter Input : cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely
Enter Input : to be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune
Enter Input : in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The
Enter Input : fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make
Enter Input : his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing
Enter Input : an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden
Enter Input : horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a
Enter Input : hideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,
Enter Input : had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried
Enter Input : away--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love
Enter Input : Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all
Enter Input : at once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,
Enter Input : smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop
Enter Input : who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help
Enter Input : recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;
Enter Input : as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man
Enter Input : he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a
Enter Input : great deal to attend to....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : *****
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!" said Dounia, kissing and
Enter Input : embracing her mother. "I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,
Enter Input : brother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him
Enter Input : before, nothing would have tempted me! Don't blame me, brother!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God has delivered us! God has delivered us!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
Enter Input : muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what
Enter Input : had happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now
Enter Input : and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:
Enter Input : she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible
Enter Input : misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his
Enter Input : joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight
Enter Input : had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to
Enter Input : them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to
Enter Input : think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination
Enter Input : range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and
Enter Input : indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of
Enter Input : Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia
Enter Input : could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna watched him timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?" said Dounia, approaching him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov raised his head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires
Enter Input : to see you once in my presence."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "See her! On no account!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "And how dare he
Enter Input : offer her money!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What answer did you give him?" asked Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that
Enter Input : he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.
Enter Input : He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he
Enter Input : has no feeling for you. He doesn't want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk
Enter Input : was altogether rather muddled."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must confess I don't quite understand him. He offers you ten
Enter Input : thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and
Enter Input : in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says is he going to be
Enter Input : married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,
Enter Input : and probably a bad one. But it's odd that he should be so clumsy about
Enter Input : it if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this
Enter Input : money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very
Enter Input : strange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;
Enter Input : that may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems
Enter Input : to have made a great impression on him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God rest her soul," exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I shall always,
Enter Input : always pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three
Enter Input : thousand! It's as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this
Enter Input : morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were
Enter Input : just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man
Enter Input : until he offered help."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov's offer. She still
Enter Input : stood meditating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He has got some terrible plan," she said in a half whisper to herself,
Enter Input : almost shuddering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again," he said to
Enter Input : Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We will watch him! I will track him out!" cried Razumihin, vigorously.
Enter Input : "I won't lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me
Enter Input : himself just now. 'Take care of my sister.' Will you give me leave, too,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not
Enter Input : leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the
Enter Input : three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively
Enter Input : conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,
Enter Input : though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And why, why should you go away?" he flowed on ecstatically. "And what
Enter Input : are you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here
Enter Input : together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.
Enter Input : For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we'll
Enter Input : plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I'll explain it all in detail to
Enter Input : you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,
Enter Input : before anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must
Enter Input : introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).
Enter Input : This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his
Enter Input : pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has
Enter Input : been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.
Enter Input : interest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year
Enter Input : I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as
Enter Input : he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have
Enter Input : enough for a start, so we'll go into partnership, and what are we going
Enter Input : to do?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length
Enter Input : that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all
Enter Input : of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad
Enter Input : publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give
Enter Input : a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been
Enter Input : dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had
Enter Input : been working in publishers' offices, and knew three European languages
Enter Input : well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was
Enter Input : "schwach" in German with an object of persuading him to take half his
Enter Input : translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and
Enter Input : Raskolnikov knew he was lying.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief
Enter Input : means of success--money of our own!" cried Razumihin warmly. "Of course
Enter Input : there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,
Enter Input : I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And
Enter Input : the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants
Enter Input : translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at
Enter Input : once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years
Enter Input : I've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every
Enter Input : detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe
Enter Input : me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept
Enter Input : the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles
Enter Input : simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would
Enter Input : not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you
Enter Input : think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he'd hesitate--they are
Enter Input : such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,
Enter Input : you trust to me, I know my way about. We'll begin in a small way and go
Enter Input : on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get
Enter Input : back our capital."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia's eyes shone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!" she said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know nothing about it, of course," put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
Enter Input : "it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It's new and untried. Of
Enter Input : course, we must remain here at least for a time." She looked at Rodya.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you think, brother?" said Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I think he's got a very good idea," he answered. "Of course, it's too
Enter Input : soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out
Enter Input : five or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself
Enter Input : which would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,
Enter Input : there's no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can
Enter Input : talk it over later...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hurrah!" cried Razumihin. "Now, stay, there's a flat here in this
Enter Input : house, belonging to the same owner. It's a special flat apart, not
Enter Input : communicating with these lodgings. It's furnished, rent moderate,
Enter Input : three rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I'll pawn your watch
Enter Input : to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.
Enter Input : You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where
Enter Input : are you off to, Rodya?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, Rodya, you are going already?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in
Enter Input : dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At such a minute?" cried Razumihin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in
Enter Input : his hand, he was preparing to leave them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever," he
Enter Input : said somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a
Enter Input : smile. "But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each
Enter Input : other..." he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it
Enter Input : somehow was uttered aloud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is the matter with you?" cried his mother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are you going, Rodya?" asked Dounia rather strangely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I'm quite obliged to..." he answered vaguely, as though hesitating
Enter Input : what he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his
Enter Input : white face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,
Enter Input : and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I
Enter Input : feel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of
Enter Input : myself... when it's possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,
Enter Input : leave me alone. I decided this even before... I'm absolutely resolved on
Enter Input : it. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be
Enter Input : alone. Forget me altogether, it's better. Don't inquire about me. When
Enter Input : I can, I'll come of myself or... I'll send for you. Perhaps it will all
Enter Input : come back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to
Enter Input : hate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister
Enter Input : were terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!" cried his
Enter Input : poor mother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia
Enter Input : overtook him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Brother, what are you doing to mother?" she whispered, her eyes
Enter Input : flashing with indignation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked dully at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No matter, I shall come.... I'm coming," he muttered in an undertone,
Enter Input : as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of
Enter Input : the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Wicked, heartless egoist!" cried Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don't you see it? You're
Enter Input : heartless after that!" Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing
Enter Input : her hand tightly. "I shall be back directly," he shouted to the
Enter Input : horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew you would run after me," he said. "Go back to them--be with
Enter Input : them... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall
Enter Input : come... if I can. Good-bye."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And without holding out his hand he walked away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But where are you going? What are you doing? What's the matter with
Enter Input : you? How can you go on like this?" Razumihin muttered, at his wits' end.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov stopped once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.
Enter Input : Don't come to see me. Maybe I'll come here.... Leave me, but _don't
Enter Input : leave_ them. Do you understand me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a
Enter Input : minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered
Enter Input : that minute all his life. Raskolnikov's burning and intent eyes
Enter Input : grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his
Enter Input : consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it
Enter Input : were, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,
Enter Input : something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....
Enter Input : Razumihin turned pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you understand now?" said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.
Enter Input : "Go back, go to them," he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went
Enter Input : out of the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,
Enter Input : how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his
Enter Input : illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every
Enter Input : day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,
Enter Input : that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the
Enter Input : best doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took
Enter Input : his place with them as a son and a brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia
Enter Input : lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the
Enter Input : porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of
Enter Input : Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard
Enter Input : the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second
Enter Input : floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey
Enter Input : over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where
Enter Input : to turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him; he
Enter Input : mechanically took hold of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who is there?" a woman's voice asked uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's I... come to see you," answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the
Enter Input : tiny entry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's you! Good heavens!" cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to
Enter Input : the spot.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Which is your room? This way?" and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at
Enter Input : her, hastened in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the
Enter Input : candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly
Enter Input : agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour
Enter Input : rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She
Enter Input : felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly
Enter Input : and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the
Enter Input : Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
Enter Input : In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always
Enter Input : kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.
Enter Input : Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and
Enter Input : this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking
Enter Input : out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute
Enter Input : angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
Enter Input : The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any
Enter Input : furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,
Enter Input : beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a
Enter Input : blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other
Enter Input : flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite
Enter Input : wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers
Enter Input : looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the
Enter Input : room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the
Enter Input : corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There
Enter Input : was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and
Enter Input : unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble
Enter Input : with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter
Enter Input : of her destinies.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am late.... It's eleven, isn't it?" he asked, still not lifting his
Enter Input : eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," muttered Sonia, "oh yes, it is," she added, hastily, as though in
Enter Input : that lay her means of escape. "My landlady's clock has just struck... I
Enter Input : heard it myself...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've come to you for the last time," Raskolnikov went on gloomily,
Enter Input : although this was the first time. "I may perhaps not see you again..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you... going away?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know... to-morrow...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?" Sonia's voice
Enter Input : shook.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I've
Enter Input : come to say one word...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was
Enter Input : sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why are you standing? Sit down," he said in a changed voice, gentle and
Enter Input : friendly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have always been like that," she said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Even when you lived at home?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, you were," he added abruptly and the expression of his face
Enter Input : and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked round him once more.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They live there, through that door?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes.... They have another room like this."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "All in one room?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should be afraid in your room at night," he observed gloomily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They are very good people, very kind," answered Sonia, who still seemed
Enter Input : bewildered, "and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.
Enter Input : And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They all stammer, don't they?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes.... He stammers and he's lame. And his wife, too.... It's not
Enter Input : exactly that she stammers, but she can't speak plainly. She is a very
Enter Input : kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven
Enter Input : children... and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the others
Enter Input : are simply ill... but they don't stammer.... But where did you hear
Enter Input : about them?" she added with some surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you
Enter Input : went out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : knelt down by your bed."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia was confused.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I fancied I saw him to-day," she whispered hesitatingly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Whom?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten
Enter Input : o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I
Enter Input : wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You were walking in the streets?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and
Enter Input : looking down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh no, what are you saying? No!" Sonia looked at him almost with
Enter Input : dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You love her, then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Love her? Of course!" said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she
Enter Input : clasped her hands in distress. "Ah, you don't.... If you only knew!
Enter Input : You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you
Enter Input : see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how
Enter Input : kind! Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement
Enter Input : and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in
Enter Input : her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that
Enter Input : she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort
Enter Input : of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in
Enter Input : every feature of her face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,
Enter Input : what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so
Enter Input : unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,
Enter Input : she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness
Enter Input : everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she
Enter Input : wouldn't do wrong. She doesn't see that it's impossible for people to
Enter Input : be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is
Enter Input : good!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what will happen to you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked at him inquiringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands
Enter Input : before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,
Enter Input : how will it be now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know," Sonia articulated mournfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Will they stay there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,
Enter Input : I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna says that she won't stay another minute."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no, don't talk like that.... We are one, we live like one." Sonia
Enter Input : was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other
Enter Input : little bird were to be angry. "And what could she do? What, what could
Enter Input : she do?" she persisted, getting hot and excited. "And how she cried
Enter Input : to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it? At one minute she
Enter Input : is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the
Enter Input : lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,
Enter Input : weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the
Enter Input : wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her
Enter Input : hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will
Enter Input : borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and
Enter Input : set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to
Enter Input : superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses
Enter Input : and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in
Enter Input : her fancies! One can't contradict her. And all the day long she has been
Enter Input : washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with
Enter Input : her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this
Enter Input : morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are
Enter Input : quite worn out. Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearly
Enter Input : enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,
Enter Input : you don't know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the
Enter Input : shopmen because she hadn't enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, after that I can understand your living like this," Raskolnikov
Enter Input : said with a bitter smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And aren't you sorry for them? Aren't you sorry?" Sonia flew at him
Enter Input : again. "Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'd
Enter Input : seen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything, oh dear! And how
Enter Input : often, how often I've brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only
Enter Input : a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I've done it! Ah,
Enter Input : I've been wretched at the thought of it all day!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You were cruel?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I--I. I went to see them," she went on, weeping, "and father said,
Enter Input : 'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.' He
Enter Input : had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives
Enter Input : there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, 'I
Enter Input : can't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to show
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some
Enter Input : collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself
Enter Input : in the glass and was delighted with them. 'Make me a present of them,
Enter Input : Sonia,' she said, 'please do.' '_Please do_,' she said, she wanted them
Enter Input : so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old
Enter Input : happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she
Enter Input : has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn't had all these years!
Enter Input : And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she'd sooner give
Enter Input : away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I
Enter Input : was sorry to give them. 'What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' I
Enter Input : said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave
Enter Input : me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.
Enter Input : And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,
Enter Input : but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,
Enter Input : change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it's nothing to you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes.... Did you know her?" Sonia asked with some surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon
Enter Input : die," said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no, no, no!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring
Enter Input : that she should not.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But it will be better if she does die."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not better, not at all better!" Sonia unconsciously repeated in
Enter Input : dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I don't know," cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her
Enter Input : hands to her head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and
Enter Input : he had only roused it again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill
Enter Input : and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?" he persisted
Enter Input : pitilessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How can you? That cannot be!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Sonia's face worked with awful terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Cannot be?" Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. "You are not
Enter Input : insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will
Enter Input : be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head
Enter Input : against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....
Enter Input : Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the
Enter Input : hospital, she will die, and the children..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, no.... God will not let it be!" broke at last from Sonia's
Enter Input : overburdened bosom.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb
Enter Input : entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.
Enter Input : Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible
Enter Input : dejection.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day?" he asked, stopping
Enter Input : suddenly before her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No," whispered Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course not. Have you tried?" he added almost ironically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And it didn't come off! Of course not! No need to ask."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't get money every day?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No," she whispered with a painful effort.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt," he said suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no! It can't be, no!" Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though
Enter Input : she had been stabbed. "God would not allow anything so awful!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He lets others come to it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no! God will protect her, God!" she repeated beside herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But, perhaps, there is no God at all," Raskolnikov answered with a sort
Enter Input : of malignance, laughed and looked at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at
Enter Input : him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not
Enter Input : speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind is
Enter Input : unhinged," he said after a brief silence.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not
Enter Input : looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put
Enter Input : his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful
Enter Input : face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were
Enter Input : twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the
Enter Input : ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And
Enter Input : certainly he looked like a madman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you doing to me?" she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden
Enter Input : anguish clutched at her heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood up at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of
Enter Input : humanity," he said wildly and walked away to the window. "Listen," he
Enter Input : added, turning to her a minute later. "I said just now to an insolent
Enter Input : man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister
Enter Input : honour making her sit beside you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?" cried Sonia,
Enter Input : frightened. "Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I'm... dishonourable....
Enter Input : Ah, why did you say that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,
Enter Input : but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that's
Enter Input : true," he added almost solemnly, "and your worst sin is that you have
Enter Input : destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn't that fearful? Isn't
Enter Input : it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at
Enter Input : the same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that you
Enter Input : are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,"
Enter Input : he went on almost in a frenzy, "how this shame and degradation can exist
Enter Input : in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be
Enter Input : better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end
Enter Input : it all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what would become of them?" Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with
Enter Input : eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she
Enter Input : must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly
Enter Input : she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that
Enter Input : now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed
Enter Input : the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his
Enter Input : peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,
Enter Input : and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought
Enter Input : of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long
Enter Input : tortured her. "What, what," he thought, "could hitherto have hindered
Enter Input : her from putting an end to it?" Only then he realised what those poor
Enter Input : little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,
Enter Input : knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and
Enter Input : the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any
Enter Input : case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she
Enter Input : have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,
Enter Input : since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he
Enter Input : knew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not
Enter Input : unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her
Enter Input : tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,
Enter Input : have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her
Enter Input : up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched
Enter Input : her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her
Enter Input : heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are three ways before her," he thought, "the canal, the madhouse,
Enter Input : or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns
Enter Input : the heart to stone."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was
Enter Input : young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing
Enter Input : that the last end was the most likely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But can that be true?" he cried to himself. "Can that creature who has
Enter Input : still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last
Enter Input : into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have
Enter Input : begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,
Enter Input : because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot
Enter Input : be!" he cried, as Sonia had just before. "No, what has kept her from the
Enter Input : canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she
Enter Input : has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her
Enter Input : mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?
Enter Input : How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she
Enter Input : is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she
Enter Input : expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn't that all mean madness?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed
Enter Input : better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?" he asked her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What should I be without God?" she whispered rapidly, forcibly,
Enter Input : glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, so that is it!" he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what does God do for you?" he asked, probing her further.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak
Enter Input : chest kept heaving with emotion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Be silent! Don't ask! You don't deserve!" she cried suddenly, looking
Enter Input : sternly and wrathfully at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's it, that's it," he repeated to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He does everything," she whispered quickly, looking down again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's the way out! That's the explanation," he decided, scrutinising
Enter Input : her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.
Enter Input : He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft
Enter Input : blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that
Enter Input : little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed
Enter Input : to him more and more strange, almost impossible. "She is a religious
Enter Input : maniac!" he repeated to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every
Enter Input : time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.
Enter Input : It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in
Enter Input : leather, old and worn.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where did you get that?" he called to her across the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was brought me," she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking
Enter Input : at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who brought it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta, I asked her for it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lizaveta! strange!" he thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every
Enter Input : moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the
Enter Input : pages.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where is the story of Lazarus?" he asked suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was
Enter Input : standing sideways to the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She stole a glance at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are not looking in the right place.... It's in the fourth gospel,"
Enter Input : she whispered sternly, without looking at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Find it and read it to me," he said. He sat down with his elbow on the
Enter Input : table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to
Enter Input : listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be
Enter Input : there if I am not in a worse place," he muttered to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly
Enter Input : to the table. She took the book however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Haven't you read it?" she asked, looking up at him across the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her voice became sterner and sterner.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And haven't you heard it in church?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... haven't been. Do you often go?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no," whispered Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand.... And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem
Enter Input : service."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "For whom?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Were you friends with Lizaveta?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she
Enter Input : couldn't.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new
Enter Input : again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious
Enter Input : maniacs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It's infectious!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Read!" he cried irritably and insistently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read
Enter Input : to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the "unhappy lunatic."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for? You don't believe?..." she whispered softly and as it were
Enter Input : breathlessly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Read! I want you to," he persisted. "You used to read to Lizaveta."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her
Enter Input : voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the
Enter Input : first syllable.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany..." she forced
Enter Input : herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an
Enter Input : overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him
Enter Input : and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on
Enter Input : her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her
Enter Input : to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these
Enter Input : feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps
Enter Input : for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy
Enter Input : father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of
Enter Input : starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same
Enter Input : time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with
Enter Input : dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read
Enter Input : to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of
Enter Input : it!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.
Enter Input : She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on
Enter Input : reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth
Enter Input : verse:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
Enter Input : their brother.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met
Enter Input : Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
Enter Input : had not died.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give
Enter Input : it Thee...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would
Enter Input : quiver and break again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the
Enter Input : resurrection, at the last day.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that
Enter Input : believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest
Enter Input : thou this?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She saith unto Him,"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as
Enter Input : though she were making a public confession of faith.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which
Enter Input : should come into the world."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went
Enter Input : on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and
Enter Input : his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at
Enter Input : His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
Enter Input : not died.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which
Enter Input : came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and
Enter Input : see.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus wept.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the
Enter Input : blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!
Enter Input : She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was
Enter Input : getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense
Enter Input : triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy
Enter Input : gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she
Enter Input : was reading by heart. At the last verse "Could not this Man which opened
Enter Input : the eyes of the blind..." dropping her voice she passionately reproduced
Enter Input : the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who
Enter Input : in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by
Enter Input : thunder, sobbing and believing.... "And _he, he_--too, is blinded and
Enter Input : unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At
Enter Input : once, now," was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy
Enter Input : anticipation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a
Enter Input : cave, and a stone lay upon it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was
Enter Input : dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been
Enter Input : dead four days."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She laid emphasis on the word _four_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
Enter Input : believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
Enter Input : And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou
Enter Input : hast heard Me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
Enter Input : stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
Enter Input : forth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And he that was dead came forth."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were
Enter Input : seeing it before her eyes.)
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about
Enter Input : with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which
Enter Input : Jesus did believed on Him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair
Enter Input : quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That is all about the raising of Lazarus," she whispered severely and
Enter Input : abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise
Enter Input : her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was
Enter Input : flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the
Enter Input : poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely
Enter Input : been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I came to speak of something," Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got
Enter Input : up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face
Enter Input : was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in
Enter Input : it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have abandoned my family to-day," he said, "my mother and sister. I
Enter Input : am not going to see them. I've broken with them completely."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for?" asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and
Enter Input : sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She
Enter Input : heard his news almost with horror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have only you now," he added. "Let us go together.... I've come to
Enter Input : you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His eyes glittered "as though he were mad," Sonia thought, in her turn.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go where?" she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do I know? I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothing
Enter Input : more. It's the same goal!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was
Enter Input : terribly, infinitely unhappy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have
Enter Input : understood. I need you, that is why I have come to you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't understand," whispered Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'll understand later. Haven't you done the same? You, too, have
Enter Input : transgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid
Enter Input : hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it's all the
Enter Input : same!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'll
Enter Input : end in the Hay Market.... But you won't be able to stand it, and if
Enter Input : you remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad
Enter Input : creature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for? What's all this for?" said Sonia, strangely and violently
Enter Input : agitated by his words.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for? Because you can't remain like this, that's why! You must look
Enter Input : things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry
Enter Input : that God won't allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken
Enter Input : to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she'll soon
Enter Input : die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to
Enter Input : grief? Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent out
Enter Input : by their mothers to beg? I've found out where those mothers live and in
Enter Input : what surroundings. Children can't remain children there! At seven the
Enter Input : child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of
Enter Input : Christ: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.' He bade us honour and love
Enter Input : them, they are the humanity of the future...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's to be done, what's to be done?" repeated Sonia, weeping
Enter Input : hysterically and wringing her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all,
Enter Input : and take the suffering on oneself. What, you don't understand? You'll
Enter Input : understand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all
Enter Input : trembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That's the goal, remember
Enter Input : that! That's my farewell message. Perhaps it's the last time I shall
Enter Input : speak to you. If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and then
Enter Input : remember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you'll
Enter Input : understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I'll tell you
Enter Input : who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia started with terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, do you know who killed her?" she asked, chilled with horror,
Enter Input : looking wildly at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I'm not
Enter Input : coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you
Enter Input : out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when
Enter Input : Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don't shake hands.
Enter Input : To-morrow!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like
Enter Input : one insane and felt it. Her head was going round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those
Enter Input : words mean? It's awful!" But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter
Enter Input : her head, not for a moment! "Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has
Enter Input : abandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And
Enter Input : what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot
Enter Input : and said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live
Enter Input : without her.... Oh, merciful heavens!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from
Enter Input : time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish
Enter Input : sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading
Enter Input : the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing
Enter Input : her feet, weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's room
Enter Input : from Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A
Enter Input : card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the
Enter Input : canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the
Enter Input : room's being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been
Enter Input : standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went
Enter Input : out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room
Enter Input : which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it
Enter Input : to the door that led to Sonia's room. The conversation had struck him
Enter Input : as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so
Enter Input : that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for
Enter Input : instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but
Enter Input : might listen in comfort.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the
Enter Input : department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in
Enter Input : to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:
Enter Input : it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected
Enter Input : that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and
Enter Input : people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually
Enter Input : passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an
Enter Input : office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had
Enter Input : no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and
Enter Input : suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some
Enter Input : mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was
Enter Input : nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty
Enter Input : details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.
Enter Input : He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him
Enter Input : that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the
Enter Input : earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait
Enter Input : like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at
Enter Input : eleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply
Enter Input : he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)
Enter Input : and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom
Enter Input : exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture
Enter Input : had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his
Enter Input : alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh
Enter Input : conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a
Enter Input : rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at
Enter Input : facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was
Enter Input : meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred
Enter Input : and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such
Enter Input : that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and
Enter Input : arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,
Enter Input : to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained
Enter Input : nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room
Enter Input : neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that
Enter Input : stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a
Enter Input : bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,
Enter Input : of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,
Enter Input : beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov's entrance
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in
Enter Input : and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial
Enter Input : and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that
Enter Input : Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had
Enter Input : been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain"... began Porfiry,
Enter Input : holding out both hands to him. "Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps
Enter Input : you don't like to be called 'my dear fellow' and 'old man!'--_tout
Enter Input : court_? Please don't think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. "In our domain,"
Enter Input : the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all
Enter Input : characteristic signs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it
Enter Input : back in time," struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,
Enter Input : but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all
Enter Input : right or shall I copy it again?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What? A paper? Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's all right," Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the
Enter Input : paper and looked at it. "Yes, it's all right. Nothing more is needed,"
Enter Input : he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the
Enter Input : table and put it on his bureau.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...
Enter Input : formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?" Raskolnikov
Enter Input : was beginning again. "Why did I put in 'I believe'" passed through
Enter Input : his mind in a flash. "Why am I so uneasy at having put in that '_I
Enter Input : believe_'?" came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his
Enter Input : uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the
Enter Input : first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that
Enter Input : this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was
Enter Input : increasing. "It's bad, it's bad! I shall say too much again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, yes! There's no hurry, there's no hurry," muttered Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,
Enter Input : as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,
Enter Input : at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov's suspicious glance, then again
Enter Input : standing still and looking him straight in the face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling
Enter Input : from one side to the other and rebounding back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We've plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a
Enter Input : cigarette!" he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. "You know I am
Enter Input : receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my
Enter Input : government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to
Enter Input : have some repairs done here. It's almost finished now.... Government
Enter Input : quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, a capital thing," answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost
Enter Input : ironically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A capital thing, a capital thing," repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as
Enter Input : though he had just thought of something quite different. "Yes, a capital
Enter Input : thing," he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and
Enter Input : stopping short two steps from him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the
Enter Input : serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than ever and he could not
Enter Input : resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me, please," he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him
Enter Input : and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. "I believe it's a
Enter Input : sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating
Enter Input : lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least
Enter Input : an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man
Enter Input : they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to
Enter Input : give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn't
Enter Input : that so? It's a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals
Enter Input : of the art?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
Enter Input : quarters... eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;
Enter Input : a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his
Enter Input : forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened
Enter Input : and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all
Enter Input : over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced
Enter Input : himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,
Enter Input : broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov's
Enter Input : repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and
Enter Input : stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his
Enter Input : intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on
Enter Input : both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in
Enter Input : his visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with
Enter Input : which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant
Enter Input : in Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been
Enter Input : embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps
Enter Input : fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here
Enter Input : unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in
Enter Input : another moment would break upon him...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his
Enter Input : cap.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Porfiry Petrovitch," he began resolutely, though with considerable
Enter Input : irritation, "yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you
Enter Input : for some inquiries" (he laid special stress on the word "inquiries"). "I
Enter Input : have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow
Enter Input : me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral
Enter Input : of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also," he added,
Enter Input : feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at
Enter Input : his anger. "I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It's
Enter Input : partly what made me ill. In short," he shouted, feeling that the phrase
Enter Input : about his illness was still more out of place, "in short, kindly examine
Enter Input : me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the
Enter Input : proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,
Enter Input : good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?"
Enter Input : cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off
Enter Input : laughing. "Please don't disturb yourself," he began fidgeting from place
Enter Input : to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. "There's no hurry,
Enter Input : there's no hurry, it's all nonsense. Oh, no, I'm very glad you've come
Enter Input : to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for
Enter Input : my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch? That is your name?... It's my nerves, you tickled me
Enter Input : so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with
Enter Input : laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I'm
Enter Input : often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I
Enter Input : shall think you are angry..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning
Enter Input : angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,"
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding
Enter Input : his visitor's eyes. "You see, I'm a bachelor, a man of no consequence
Enter Input : and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I'm set, I'm
Enter Input : running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in
Enter Input : our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but
Enter Input : respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before
Enter Input : they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit
Enter Input : opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of
Enter Input : conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have
Enter Input : their subjects of conversation, _c'est de rigueur_, but people of the
Enter Input : middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied
Enter Input : and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public
Enter Input : interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don't want to deceive one
Enter Input : another, I don't know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it
Enter Input : looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so
Enter Input : delighted..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with
Enter Input : a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch. "Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly
Enter Input : babble?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a
Enter Input : friend?" Porfiry pattered on, "and you know all these official
Enter Input : duties... please don't mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear
Enter Input : fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is
Enter Input : absolutely indispensable for me. I'm always sitting and so glad to be
Enter Input : moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I
Enter Input : always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,
Enter Input : even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have
Enter Input : it, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries
Enter Input : and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...
Enter Input : I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for
Enter Input : the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation
Enter Input : yourself just now very aptly and wittily." (Raskolnikov had made no
Enter Input : observation of the kind.) "One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One
Enter Input : keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and
Enter Input : we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for
Enter Input : our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree
Enter Input : with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that
Enter Input : they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily
Enter Input : put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous
Enter Input : comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by 'government
Enter Input : quarters'... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won't go on! Ah,
Enter Input : by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just
Enter Input : now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what's the use of formality?
Enter Input : In many cases it's nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets
Enter Input : a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow
Enter Input : me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining
Enter Input : lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of
Enter Input : investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on
Enter Input : uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again
Enter Input : reverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving
Enter Input : his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his
Enter Input : right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations
Enter Input : that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov
Enter Input : suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop
Enter Input : for a moment near the door, as though he were listening.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is he expecting anything?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are certainly quite right about it," Porfiry began gaily, looking
Enter Input : with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and
Enter Input : instantly put him on his guard); "certainly quite right in laughing so
Enter Input : wittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological
Enter Input : methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres
Enter Input : too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if
Enter Input : I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to
Enter Input : be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you're reading for the law,
Enter Input : of course, Rodion Romanovitch?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I was..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don't
Enter Input : suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish
Enter Input : about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I
Enter Input : took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him
Enter Input : prematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may
Enter Input : be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in
Enter Input : quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn't I let him walk
Enter Input : about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don't quite understand, so
Enter Input : I'll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I
Enter Input : may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You're
Enter Input : laughing?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed
Enter Input : lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so
Enter Input : different. You say 'evidence'. Well, there may be evidence. But
Enter Input : evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining
Enter Input : lawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so
Enter Input : to say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence
Enter Input : such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
Enter Input : And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_
Enter Input : was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of
Enter Input : getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to
Enter Input : speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his
Enter Input : mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at
Enter Input : Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright
Enter Input : that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when
Enter Input : they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,
Enter Input : I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at
Enter Input : least. You're laughing, you don't believe me again? Of course, you're
Enter Input : right, too. You're right, you're right. These are special cases, I
Enter Input : admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the
Enter Input : general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,
Enter Input : for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at
Enter Input : all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon
Enter Input : as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and
Enter Input : sometimes a case unlike any that's gone before. Very comic cases of that
Enter Input : sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don't touch
Enter Input : him and don't worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every
Enter Input : moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and
Enter Input : if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he'll be bound to lose his
Enter Input : head. He'll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as
Enter Input : plain as twice two are four--it's delightful. It may be so with a simple
Enter Input : peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a
Enter Input : certain side, it's a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it's a very
Enter Input : important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then
Enter Input : there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they
Enter Input : are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer
Enter Input : from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it's
Enter Input : no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk
Enter Input : about for a bit! I know well enough that I've caught him and that he
Enter Input : won't escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A
Enter Input : Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching
Enter Input : and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country
Enter Input : perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.
Enter Input : A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such
Enter Input : strangers as our peasants. He-he! But that's all nonsense, and on
Enter Input : the surface. It's not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is
Enter Input : _psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!
Enter Input : Through a law of nature he can't escape me if he had anywhere to go.
Enter Input : Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That's how he will keep
Enter Input : circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He'll
Enter Input : begin to brood, he'll weave a tangle round himself, he'll worry himself
Enter Input : to death! What's more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I
Enter Input : only give him long enough interval.... And he'll keep circling round
Enter Input : me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He'll fly straight into my
Enter Input : mouth and I'll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You
Enter Input : don't believe me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with
Enter Input : the same intensity into Porfiry's face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a lesson," he thought, turning cold. "This is beyond the cat
Enter Input : playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He can't be showing off his power
Enter Input : with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must
Enter Input : have another object. What is it? It's all nonsense, my friend, you are
Enter Input : pretending, to scare me! You've no proofs and the man I saw had no
Enter Input : real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up
Enter Input : beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won't do it! But
Enter Input : why give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my
Enter Input : friend, you are wrong, you won't do it even though you have some trap
Enter Input : for me... let us see what you have in store for me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times
Enter Input : he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he
Enter Input : dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked
Enter Input : with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to
Enter Input : speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best
Enter Input : policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be
Enter Input : irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too
Enter Input : freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke
Enter Input : on you," Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling
Enter Input : at every instant and again pacing round the room. "And to be sure you're
Enter Input : right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in
Enter Input : other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse
Enter Input : an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to
Enter Input : say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like
Enter Input : all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and
Enter Input : that's for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as
Enter Input : far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beaten
Enter Input : Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it
Enter Input : all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered
Enter Input : with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are
Enter Input : laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!
Enter Input : But I can't help it, it's my weakness. I am fond of military science.
Enter Input : And I'm ever so fond of reading all military histories. I've certainly
Enter Input : missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my
Enter Input : word I ought. I shouldn't have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a
Enter Input : major, he-he! Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about
Enter Input : this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man's temperament, my
Enter Input : dear sir, are weighty matters and it's astonishing how they sometimes
Enter Input : deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking
Enter Input : seriously, Rodion Romanovitch" (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who
Enter Input : was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even
Enter Input : his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) "Moreover, I'm
Enter Input : a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I
Enter Input : really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don't even expect a
Enter Input : reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid
Enter Input : thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of
Enter Input : life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a
Enter Input : poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he's liable
Enter Input : to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after
Enter Input : all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal's temperament, worse
Enter Input : luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don't think
Enter Input : of that 'when they overstep all obstacles,' as you wittily and cleverly
Enter Input : expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special
Enter Input : case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;
Enter Input : you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at
Enter Input : the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course
Enter Input : there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he's
Enter Input : given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn't reckon on his
Enter Input : temperament. That's what betrays him! Another time he will be carried
Enter Input : away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he
Enter Input : will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will
Enter Input : be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us
Enter Input : an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think
Enter Input : differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like
Enter Input : that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,
Enter Input : speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of
Enter Input : allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn't you take me long
Enter Input : ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,
Enter Input : the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything
Enter Input : like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so
Enter Input : pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, don't trouble, please," cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke
Enter Input : into a laugh. "Please don't trouble."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical
Enter Input : laughter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Porfiry Petrovitch," he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though
Enter Input : his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. "I see clearly at last
Enter Input : that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister
Enter Input : Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you
Enter Input : find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then
Enter Input : prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my
Enter Input : face and worried..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain
Enter Input : his voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't allow it!" he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. "Do
Enter Input : you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won't allow it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! What does it mean?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently
Enter Input : quite frightened. "Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the
Enter Input : matter with you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't allow it," Raskolnikov shouted again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hush, my dear man! They'll hear and come in. Just think, what could we
Enter Input : say to them?" Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face
Enter Input : close to Raskolnikov's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't allow it, I won't allow it," Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,
Enter Input : but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You're
Enter Input : ill!" and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a
Enter Input : decanter of water in the corner. "Come, drink a little," he whispered,
Enter Input : rushing up to him with the decanter. "It will be sure to do you good."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch's alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov
Enter Input : was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take
Enter Input : the water, however.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you'll drive yourself out of your
Enter Input : mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to
Enter Input : his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, you've had a little attack! You'll bring back your illness again,
Enter Input : my dear fellow," Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,
Enter Input : though he still looked rather disconcerted. "Good heavens, you must
Enter Input : take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me
Enter Input : yesterday--I know, I know, I've a nasty, ironical temper, but what they
Enter Input : made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you'd been. We
Enter Input : dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands
Enter Input : in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy's sake, sit
Enter Input : down!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov answered sharply.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You knew?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew. What of it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;
Enter Input : I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night
Enter Input : when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so
Enter Input : that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I
Enter Input : understand your state of mind at that time... but you'll drive yourself
Enter Input : mad like that, upon my word! You'll lose your head! You're full of
Enter Input : generous indignation at the wrongs you've received, first from destiny,
Enter Input : and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to
Enter Input : another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because
Enter Input : you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That's so, isn't
Enter Input : it? I have guessed how you feel, haven't I? Only in that way you'll
Enter Input : lose your head and Razumihin's, too; he's too _good_ a man for such
Enter Input : a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your
Enter Input : illness is infectious for him... I'll tell you about it when you are
Enter Input : more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness' sake. Please rest, you
Enter Input : look shocking, do sit down."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In
Enter Input : amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who
Enter Input : still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.
Enter Input : But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange
Enter Input : inclination to believe. Porfiry's unexpected words about the flat had
Enter Input : utterly overwhelmed him. "How can it be, he knows about the flat then,"
Enter Input : he thought suddenly, "and he tells it me himself!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a
Enter Input : case of morbid psychology," Porfiry went on quickly. "A man confessed to
Enter Input : murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought
Enter Input : forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but
Enter Input : only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that
Enter Input : he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it
Enter Input : got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he
Enter Input : persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court
Enter Input : of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under
Enter Input : proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear
Enter Input : fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse
Enter Input : to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about
Enter Input : blood! I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man
Enter Input : is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the
Enter Input : same with bell-ringing.... It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You
Enter Input : have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced
Enter Input : doctor, what's the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You
Enter Input : were delirious when you did all this!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it possible, is it possible," flashed through his mind, "that he is
Enter Input : still lying? He can't be, he can't be." He rejected that idea, feeling
Enter Input : to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury
Enter Input : might drive him mad.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing," he cried, straining
Enter Input : every faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game, "I was quite myself, do you
Enter Input : hear?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,
Enter Input : you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell
Enter Input : me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were
Enter Input : actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,
Enter Input : would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession
Enter Input : of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be
Enter Input : possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on
Enter Input : your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
Enter Input : That's so, isn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on
Enter Input : the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he
Enter Input : came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don't
Enter Input : conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You keep telling lies," he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips
Enter Input : into a sickly smile, "you are trying again to show that you know all
Enter Input : my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand," he said, conscious
Enter Input : himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. "You want to
Enter Input : frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of
Enter Input : intense hatred in his eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You keep lying," he said. "You know perfectly well that the best
Enter Input : policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to
Enter Input : conceal as little as possible. I don't believe you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a wily person you are!" Porfiry tittered, "there's no catching
Enter Input : you; you've a perfect monomania. So you don't believe me? But still you
Enter Input : do believe me, you believe a quarter; I'll soon make you believe the
Enter Input : whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you
Enter Input : good."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's lips trembled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I do," went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov's arm genially, "you
Enter Input : must take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here
Enter Input : now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do
Enter Input : nothing but frighten them..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of
Enter Input : yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don't
Enter Input : notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From
Enter Input : Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,
Enter Input : you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your
Enter Input : suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return
Enter Input : to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a
Enter Input : precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),
Enter Input : and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,
Enter Input : should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your
Enter Input : suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted
Enter Input : your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your
Enter Input : expression) saying: 'And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or
Enter Input : nearly eleven at the murdered woman's flat and why did you ring the bell
Enter Input : and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters
Enter Input : to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?' That's how
Enter Input : I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to
Enter Input : have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps
Enter Input : have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have
Enter Input : not done that! But you can't look at it normally and you see nothing, I
Enter Input : say again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to
Enter Input : perceive it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are lying all the while," he cried, "I don't know your object,
Enter Input : but you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be
Enter Input : mistaken!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am lying?" Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving
Enter Input : a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least
Enter Input : concerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him. "I am lying... but how did
Enter Input : I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving
Enter Input : you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,
Enter Input : melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!
Enter Input : Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very
Enter Input : reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don't remember--that's
Enter Input : all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium
Enter Input : were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There
Enter Input : may have been others, eh? He-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Briefly," he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so
Enter Input : doing pushing Porfiry back a little, "briefly, I want to know, do you
Enter Input : acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a business I'm having with you!" cried Porfiry with a perfectly
Enter Input : good-humoured, sly and composed face. "And why do you want to know, why
Enter Input : do you want to know so much, since they haven't begun to worry you? Why,
Enter Input : you are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why
Enter Input : do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I repeat," Raskolnikov cried furiously, "that I can't put up with it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "With what? Uncertainty?" interrupted Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't jeer at me! I won't have it! I tell you I won't have it. I can't
Enter Input : and I won't, do you hear, do you hear?" he shouted, bringing his fist
Enter Input : down on the table again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hush! Hush! They'll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of
Enter Input : yourself. I am not joking," Porfiry whispered, but this time there was
Enter Input : not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now
Enter Input : he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all
Enter Input : mystification.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell
Enter Input : into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to
Enter Input : speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will not allow myself to be tortured," he whispered, instantly
Enter Input : recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and
Enter Input : driven to even greater fury by the thought. "Arrest me, search me, but
Enter Input : kindly act in due form and don't play with me! Don't dare!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't worry about the form," Porfiry interrupted with the same sly
Enter Input : smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. "I invited
Enter Input : you to see me quite in a friendly way."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,
Enter Input : I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took up his cap and went to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And won't you see my little surprise?" chuckled Porfiry, again taking
Enter Input : him by the arm and stopping him at the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What surprise?" he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in
Enter Input : alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My little surprise, it's sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!"
Enter Input : (He pointed to the locked door.) "I locked him in that he should not
Enter Input : escape."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it? Where? What?..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was
Enter Input : locked.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's locked, here is the key!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he brought a key out of his pocket.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are lying," roared Raskolnikov without restraint, "you lie, you
Enter Input : damned punchinello!" and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other
Enter Input : door, not at all alarmed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray
Enter Input : myself to you..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don't shout, I shall call the
Enter Input : clerks."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work
Enter Input : me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce
Enter Input : your facts! I understand it all. You've no evidence, you have only
Enter Input : wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov's! You knew my character, you
Enter Input : wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and
Enter Input : deputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?
Enter Input : Where are they? Produce them?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do
Enter Input : so would not be acting in form as you say, you don't know the business,
Enter Input : my dear fellow.... And there's no escaping form, as you see," Porfiry
Enter Input : muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, they're coming," cried Raskolnikov. "You've sent for them! You
Enter Input : expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,
Enter Input : what you like!... I am ready!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected
Enter Input : that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for
Enter Input : such a conclusion to their interview.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a
Enter Input : little.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. "Why, I gave orders..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were
Enter Input : several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing
Enter Input : somebody back.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The prisoner Nikolay has been brought," someone answered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What's he doing here?
Enter Input : How irregular!" cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But he..." began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave
Enter Input : a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This man's appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared
Enter Input : straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined
Enter Input : gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his
Enter Input : face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were
Enter Input : faintly twitching.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,
Enter Input : slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom
Enter Input : he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing
Enter Input : him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them
Enter Input : tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go away, it's too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you
Enter Input : brought him so soon?" Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,
Enter Input : and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter?" cried Porfiry, surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer," Nikolay articulated
Enter Input : suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;
Enter Input : even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and
Enter Input : stood immovable.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary
Enter Input : stupefaction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... am the murderer," repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What... you... what... whom did you kill?" Porfiry Petrovitch was
Enter Input : obviously bewildered.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with
Enter Input : an axe. Darkness came over me," he added suddenly, and was again silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some
Enter Input : moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back
Enter Input : the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.
Enter Input : Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,
Enter Input : staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,
Enter Input : looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and
Enter Input : seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're in too great a hurry," he shouted at him, almost angrily. "I
Enter Input : didn't ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence," Nikolay pronounced.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach! What did you kill them with?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "An axe. I had it ready."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Nikolay did not understand the question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you do it alone?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs
Enter Input : like that at the time? The porters met you both!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka," Nikolay replied
Enter Input : hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I knew it!" cried Porfiry, with vexation. "It's not his own tale he is
Enter Input : telling," he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested
Enter Input : on Raskolnikov again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
Enter Input : forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!" he flew up to him, "this won't
Enter Input : do; I'm afraid you must go... it's no good your staying... I will...
Enter Input : you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I suppose you didn't expect it?" said Raskolnikov who, though he had
Enter Input : not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is
Enter Input : trembling! He-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I am; I didn't expect it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to
Enter Input : be gone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And your little surprise, aren't you going to show it to me?"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical
Enter Input : person! Come, till we meet!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I believe we can say _good-bye_!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's in God's hands," muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people
Enter Input : were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,
Enter Input : whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there
Enter Input : waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running
Enter Input : after him, out of breath.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it's in God's hands,
Enter Input : but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask
Enter Input : you... so we shall meet again, shan't we?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Shan't we?" he added again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I
Enter Input : lost my temper," began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage
Enter Input : that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't mention it, don't mention it," Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.
Enter Input : "I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet
Enter Input : again. If it's God's will, we may see a great deal of one another."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And will get to know each other through and through?" added
Enter Input : Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes; know each other through and through," assented Porfiry Petrovitch,
Enter Input : and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. "Now
Enter Input : you're going to a birthday party?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To a funeral."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know what to wish you," said Raskolnikov, who had begun to
Enter Input : descend the stairs, but looked back again. "I should like to wish you
Enter Input : success, but your office is such a comical one."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why comical?" Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to
Enter Input : prick up his ears at this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay
Enter Input : psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have
Enter Input : been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and
Enter Input : now that he has confessed, you'll begin vivisecting him again. 'You are
Enter Input : lying,' you'll say. 'You are not the murderer! You can't be! It's not
Enter Input : your own tale you are telling!' You must admit it's a comical business!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was
Enter Input : not his own tale he was telling?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How could I help noticing it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You've really a
Enter Input : playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say
Enter Input : that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, of Gogol."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So shall I."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that
Enter Input : on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to
Enter Input : collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he
Enter Input : was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,
Enter Input : amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay's confession
Enter Input : was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at
Enter Input : once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they
Enter Input : would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do
Enter Input : something for himself, for the danger was imminent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.
Enter Input : Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with
Enter Input : Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,
Enter Input : he did not yet know all Porfiry's aims, he could not see into all his
Enter Input : calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew
Enter Input : better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry's "lead" had been for
Enter Input : him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,
Enter Input : circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first
Enter Input : glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was
Enter Input : bound to win. There's no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised
Enter Input : himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was
Enter Input : nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn't
Enter Input : he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some
Enter Input : surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting
Enter Input : something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the
Enter Input : unexpected appearance of Nikolay?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked
Enter Input : something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his
Enter Input : sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was
Enter Input : that "surprise"? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have
Enter Input : concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His
Enter Input : yesterday's visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If
Enter Input : Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in
Enter Input : his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his
Enter Input : cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might
Enter Input : consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he
Enter Input : wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna's. He would be too late for
Enter Input : the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,
Enter Input : and there at once he would see Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a
Enter Input : moment on to his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To-day! To-day," he repeated to himself. "Yes, to-day! So it must
Enter Input : be...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He
Enter Input : started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there
Enter Input : suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday's visitor _from underground_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,
Enter Input : and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as
Enter Input : yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change
Enter Input : in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put
Enter Input : his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have
Enter Input : looked exactly like a peasant woman.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want?" asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was
Enter Input : still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching
Enter Input : it with his finger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have sinned," the man articulated softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "By evil thoughts."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They looked at one another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go
Enter Input : to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they
Enter Input : let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my
Enter Input : sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for
Enter Input : you...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who came?" Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I did, I've wronged you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you come from that house?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was standing at the gate with them... don't you remember? We have
Enter Input : carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare
Enter Input : hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came
Enter Input : clearly before Raskolnikov's mind; he recollected that there had
Enter Input : been several people there besides the porters, women among them.
Enter Input : He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
Enter Input : police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even
Enter Input : now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round
Enter Input : and made him some answer....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : So this was the solution of yesterday's horror. The most awful thought
Enter Input : was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself
Enter Input : on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell
Enter Input : nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So
Enter Input : Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this
Enter Input : _psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more
Enter Input : facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then
Enter Input : what can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest
Enter Input : him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not
Enter Input : known about it before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was it you who told Porfiry... that I'd been there?" he cried, struck
Enter Input : by a sudden idea.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What Porfiry?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The head of the detective department?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To-day?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he
Enter Input : worried you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where? What? When?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my
Enter Input : word!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said," began the man;
Enter Input : "for it's too late, said they, and maybe he'll be angry that we did not
Enter Input : come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making
Enter Input : inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The
Enter Input : first time I went he wasn't there, when I came an hour later he couldn't
Enter Input : see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of
Enter Input : everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room
Enter Input : and punching himself on the chest. 'What do you scoundrels mean by it?
Enter Input : If I'd known about it I should have arrested him!' Then he ran out,
Enter Input : called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned
Enter Input : to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I
Enter Input : told him everything, and I told him that you didn't dare to say a word
Enter Input : in answer to me yesterday and that you didn't recognise me. And he
Enter Input : fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and
Enter Input : getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told
Enter Input : me to go into the next room. 'Sit there a bit,' he said. 'Don't move,
Enter Input : whatever you may hear.' And he set a chair there for me and locked
Enter Input : me in. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'I may call you.' And when Nikolay'd been
Enter Input : brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. 'I shall send for you
Enter Input : again and question you,' he said."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And did he question Nikolay while you were there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground
Enter Input : with his finger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "May God forgive you," answered Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,
Enter Input : turned slowly and went out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways," repeated
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now we'll make a fight for it," he said, with a malicious smile, as he
Enter Input : went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and
Enter Input : contempt he recollected his "cowardice."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : PART V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and
Enter Input : her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.
Enter Input : Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept
Enter Input : as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before
Enter Input : fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been
Enter Input : gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had
Enter Input : jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at
Enter Input : his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of
Enter Input : late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the
Enter Input : conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better
Enter Input : one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned
Enter Input : aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey
Enter Input : Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.
Enter Input : That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his
Enter Input : young friend's account. He had set down a good many points against him
Enter Input : of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to
Enter Input : have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday's interview.
Enter Input : That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness
Enter Input : and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness
Enter Input : followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case
Enter Input : in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat
Enter Input : which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being
Enter Input : redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,
Enter Input : would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just
Enter Input : been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In
Enter Input : the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the
Enter Input : instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the
Enter Input : flat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?" Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a
Enter Input : gleam of desperate hope. "Can all that be really so irrevocably over?
Enter Input : Is it no use to make another effort?" The thought of Dounia sent a
Enter Input : voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,
Enter Input : and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money," he thought, as
Enter Input : he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov's room, "and why on earth was I
Enter Input : such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny
Enter Input : so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!
Enter Input : foo! If I'd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau
Enter Input : and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and
Enter Input : all that sort of trash from Knopp's and the English shop, my position
Enter Input : would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me
Enter Input : so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return
Enter Input : money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to
Enter Input : do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man
Enter Input : who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H'm! I've made a
Enter Input : blunder."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a
Enter Input : fool--but not aloud, of course.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The
Enter Input : preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna's excited
Enter Input : his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he
Enter Input : fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares
Enter Input : he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
Enter Input : laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he
Enter Input : heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the
Enter Input : lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead
Enter Input : man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
Enter Input : his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,
Enter Input : was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most
Enter Input : important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with
Enter Input : great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was
Enter Input : very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;
Enter Input : she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she
Enter Input : was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he
Enter Input : went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov's, somewhat thoughtful. He
Enter Input : had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay
Enter Input : with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He
Enter Input : had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from
Enter Input : parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard
Enter Input : of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young
Enter Input : progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting
Enter Input : circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had
Enter Input : impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who
Enter Input : despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a
Enter Input : peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form
Enter Input : even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had
Enter Input : heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some
Enter Input : sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and
Enter Input : distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for
Enter Input : many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown
Enter Input : up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the
Enter Input : thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of
Enter Input : this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,
Enter Input : when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases
Enter Input : in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,
Enter Input : had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal
Enter Input : for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious
Enter Input : trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the
Enter Input : subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to
Enter Input : anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of "our younger
Enter Input : generation." He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before
Enter Input : his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current
Enter Input : phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace
Enter Input : simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he
Enter Input : had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it
Enter Input : would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the
Enter Input : systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for
Enter Input : him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what
Enter Input : was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything
Enter Input : to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what
Enter Input : precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up
Enter Input : to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the
Enter Input : thing to do or not? Couldn't he gain something through them? In fact
Enter Input : hundreds of questions presented themselves.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely
Enter Input : flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk
Enter Input : and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather
Enter Input : soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in
Enter Input : speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.
Enter Input : He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did
Enter Input : not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch
Enter Input : really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress
Enter Input : and "our younger generation" from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous
Enter Input : and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,
Enter Input : half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in
Enter Input : fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,
Enter Input : however sincerely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to
Enter Input : dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.
Enter Input : However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that "he was
Enter Input : not the right sort of man." He had tried expounding to him the system of
Enter Input : Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to
Enter Input : listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun
Enter Input : instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace
Enter Input : simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of
Enter Input : any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up
Enter Input : third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own
Enter Input : work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he
Enter Input : would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest
Enter Input : praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,
Enter Input : when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to
Enter Input : the establishment of the new "commune," or to abstain from christening
Enter Input : his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a
Enter Input : month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing
Enter Input : his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were
Enter Input : attributed to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some
Enter Input : five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over
Enter Input : bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money
Enter Input : walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank
Enter Input : notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money
Enter Input : unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and
Enter Input : was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by
Enter Input : reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey
Enter Input : Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation
Enter Input : of a new special "commune." The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame
Enter Input : betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the "humane" Andrey
Enter Input : Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch's ill-humour to his recent breach
Enter Input : with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that
Enter Input : theme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which
Enter Input : might console his worthy friend and "could not fail" to promote his
Enter Input : development.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the
Enter Input : widow's, isn't there?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting
Enter Input : Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, don't you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think
Enter Input : about all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were
Enter Input : talking to her yesterday..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on
Enter Input : this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I
Enter Input : was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the
Enter Input : wines! Several people are invited. It's beyond everything!" continued
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the
Enter Input : conversation. "What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don't
Enter Input : remember. But I shan't go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in
Enter Input : passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year's salary as
Enter Input : a destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on
Enter Input : that account, hasn't she? He-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't intend to go either," said Lebeziatnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well
Enter Input : hesitate, he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who thrashed? Whom?" cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so
Enter Input : yesterday... so that's what your convictions amount to... and the woman
Enter Input : question, too, wasn't quite sound, he-he-he!" and Pyotr Petrovitch, as
Enter Input : though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's all slander and nonsense!" cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always
Enter Input : afraid of allusions to the subject. "It was not like that at all, it
Enter Input : was quite different. You've heard it wrong; it's a libel. I was simply
Enter Input : defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled
Enter Input : out all my whiskers.... It's permissable for anyone, I should hope,
Enter Input : to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on
Enter Input : principle, for it's an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply
Enter Input : pushed her back."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He-he-he!" Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But
Enter Input : that's nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the
Enter Input : woman question! You don't understand; I used to think, indeed, that
Enter Input : if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is
Enter Input : maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I
Enter Input : reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,
Enter Input : for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is
Enter Input : unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality
Enter Input : in fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is
Enter Input : fighting... there won't be later, but at present there is... confound
Enter Input : it! How muddled one gets with you! It's not on that account that I
Enter Input : am not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the
Enter Input : revolting convention of memorial dinners, that's why! Though, of course,
Enter Input : one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won't be any priests at
Enter Input : it. I should certainly go if there were."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you would sit down at another man's table and insult it and those
Enter Input : who invited you. Eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I
Enter Input : might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It's
Enter Input : a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the
Enter Input : more harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And
Enter Input : something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?
Enter Input : They might be offended at first, but afterwards they'd see I'd done them
Enter Input : a service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed
Enter Input : because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to
Enter Input : her father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally and
Enter Input : was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,
Enter Input : that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think
Enter Input : that's all nonsense and there's no need of softness; on the contrary,
Enter Input : what's wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she
Enter Input : abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a
Enter Input : letter: 'I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never
Enter Input : forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there
Enter Input : is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have
Enter Input : only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given
Enter Input : myself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly
Enter Input : because I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.
Enter Input : Do not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.'
Enter Input : That's how letters like that ought to be written!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it's only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what
Enter Input : if it were the fifteenth, that's all nonsense! And if ever I regretted
Enter Input : the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think
Enter Input : if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I
Enter Input : would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would
Enter Input : have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will," Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : interrupted, "but tell me this; do you know the dead man's daughter, the
Enter Input : delicate-looking little thing? It's true what they say about her, isn't
Enter Input : it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that
Enter Input : this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.
Enter Input : In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is
Enter Input : compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,
Enter Input : because it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she
Enter Input : was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which
Enter Input : she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future
Enter Input : society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another
Enter Input : significance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against
Enter Input : the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice
Enter Input : indeed when I look at her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's another slander," he yelled. "It was not so at all! That was all
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's invention, for she did not understand! And I never
Enter Input : made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely
Enter Input : disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her
Enter Input : protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you asked her to join your community?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell
Enter Input : you. You don't understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The
Enter Input : community is established that there should be no such rôles. In a
Enter Input : community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid
Enter Input : here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural
Enter Input : becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the
Enter Input : environment. It's all the environment and man himself is nothing. And
Enter Input : I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof
Enter Input : that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to
Enter Input : attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.
Enter Input : What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of
Enter Input : our own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our
Enter Input : convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I'm still developing Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself
Enter Input : how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her
Enter Input : that all that modesty is nonsense?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying
Enter Input : so--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude
Enter Input : you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have
Enter Input : only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question
Enter Input : of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed
Enter Input : prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that's for her
Enter Input : to decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,
Enter Input : I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but
Enter Input : as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more
Enter Input : respect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that's all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never
Enter Input : thought of that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't understand, as I've told you already! Of course, she is in
Enter Input : such a position, but it's another question. Quite another question!
Enter Input : You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider
Enter Input : deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow
Enter Input : creature. You don't know what a character she is! I am only sorry that
Enter Input : of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used
Enter Input : to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and
Enter Input : resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has
Enter Input : little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to
Enter Input : break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she
Enter Input : thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of
Enter Input : hands, that is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her
Enter Input : hand, because it's a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and
Enter Input : I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the
Enter Input : workmen's associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question
Enter Input : of coming into the room in the future society."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what's that, pray?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community
Enter Input : the right to enter another member's room, whether man or woman, at any
Enter Input : time... and we decided that he has!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov was really angry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are always thinking of something unpleasant," he cried with
Enter Input : aversion. "Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I
Enter Input : referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It's always
Enter Input : a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before
Enter Input : they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I've often
Enter Input : maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till
Enter Input : he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you
Enter Input : find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready
Enter Input : to clean out any cesspool you like. And it's not a question of
Enter Input : self-sacrifice, it's simply work, honourable, useful work which is
Enter Input : as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a
Enter Input : Pushkin, because it is more useful."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean by 'more honourable'? I don't understand such
Enter Input : expressions to describe human activity. 'More honourable,' 'nobler'--all
Enter Input : those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is
Enter Input : _of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!
Enter Input : You can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money
Enter Input : and was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The
Enter Input : "cesspool question" had already been a subject of dispute between them.
Enter Input : What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it
Enter Input : amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his
Enter Input : young friend.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and
Enter Input : annoying," blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his "independence"
Enter Input : and his "protests" did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still
Enter Input : behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'd better tell me this," Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty
Enter Input : displeasure, "can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with
Enter Input : that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think
Enter Input : they've all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of
Enter Input : steps... I want to see her, that young person."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for?" Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I
Enter Input : wanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the
Enter Input : interview. It's better you should be, indeed. For there's no knowing
Enter Input : what you might imagine."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I shan't imagine anything. I only asked and, if you've anything to say
Enter Input : to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I'll go directly and you
Enter Input : may be sure I won't be in your way."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very
Enter Input : much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in
Enter Input : such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as
Enter Input : a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her "politely
Enter Input : and affably," but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in
Enter Input : his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight
Enter Input : in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He
Enter Input : hastened to "reassure" her and made her sit down facing him at the
Enter Input : table. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes
Enter Input : lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes
Enter Input : remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?" he asked him in a whisper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....
Enter Input : Why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave
Enter Input : me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,
Enter Input : but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn't like Raskolnikov to
Enter Input : repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand!" Lebeziatnikov saw the point. "Yes, you are right.... Of
Enter Input : course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,
Enter Input : but... still, you are right. Certainly I'll stay. I'll stand here at the
Enter Input : window and not be in your way... I think you are right..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked
Enter Input : attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe
Enter Input : expression, as much as to say, "don't you make any mistake, madam."
Enter Input : Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your
Enter Input : respected mamma.... That's right, isn't it? Katerina Ivanovna stands
Enter Input : in the place of a mother to you?" Pyotr Petrovitch began with great
Enter Input : dignity, though affably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was evident that his intentions were friendly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so, yes; the place of a mother," Sonia answered, timidly and
Enter Input : hurriedly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable
Enter Input : circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in
Enter Input : spite of your mamma's kind invitation."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... I'll tell her... at once."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Wait, that's not all," Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her
Enter Input : simplicity and ignorance of good manners, "and you know me little, my
Enter Input : dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble
Enter Input : a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself
Enter Input : only. I have another object."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the
Enter Input : grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she
Enter Input : quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it
Enter Input : horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person's
Enter Input : money. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held
Enter Input : in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a
Enter Input : yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not
Enter Input : knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight
Enter Input : in the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to
Enter Input : ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so
Enter Input : express it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... preternatural..." Sonia hurriedly assented.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak
Enter Input : compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,
Enter Input : foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this
Enter Input : poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me to ask," Sonia rose to her feet, "did you say something to her
Enter Input : yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had
Enter Input : undertaken to get her one. Was that true?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not in the slightest, and indeed it's an absurdity! I merely hinted at
Enter Input : her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had
Enter Input : died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your
Enter Input : late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the
Enter Input : service at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be
Enter Input : very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in
Enter Input : that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,
Enter Input : he-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes
Enter Input : everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like
Enter Input : that... yes... You must excuse her," said Sonia, and again she got up to
Enter Input : go.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you haven't heard what I have to say."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I haven't heard," muttered Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then sit down." She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third
Enter Input : time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,
Enter Input : as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,
Enter Input : that is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get
Enter Input : up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as
Enter Input : is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous
Enter Input : of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might
Enter Input : be done."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes... God will repay you for it," faltered Sonia, gazing intently
Enter Input : at Pyotr Petrovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we
Enter Input : will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come
Enter Input : to me at seven o'clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But
Enter Input : there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and
Enter Input : for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In
Enter Input : my opinion money cannot be, indeed it's unsafe to put it into Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna's own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she
Enter Input : has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots
Enter Input : or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,
Enter Input : I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.
Enter Input : To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust of
Enter Input : bread. It's absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought
Enter Input : to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but
Enter Input : only you, for instance. Am I right?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was
Enter Input : so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very
Enter Input : sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will
Enter Input : all be... and God will reward... and the orphans..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia burst into tears.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the
Enter Input : benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me
Enter Input : personally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in
Enter Input : connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I
Enter Input : cannot do more..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully
Enter Input : unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something
Enter Input : and began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously
Enter Input : to the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,
Enter Input : and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the
Enter Input : room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he
Enter Input : walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I heard and _saw_ everything," he said, laying stress on the last verb.
Enter Input : "That is honourable, I mean to say, it's humane! You wanted to avoid
Enter Input : gratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle
Enter Input : sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the
Enter Input : evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with
Enter Input : pleasure--yes, yes, I like it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all nonsense," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,
Enter Input : looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it's not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as
Enter Input : you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,
Enter Input : such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still
Enter Input : deserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback
Enter Input : your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your
Enter Input : ill-luck yesterday," cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt
Enter Input : a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. "And, what do you want with
Enter Input : marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do
Enter Input : you cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you
Enter Input : like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't come off, that you are
Enter Input : free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I've spoken
Enter Input : my mind!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because I don't want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and
Enter Input : to bring up another man's children, that's why I want legal marriage,"
Enter Input : Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed preoccupied by something.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Children? You referred to children," Lebeziatnikov started off like
Enter Input : a warhorse at the trumpet call. "Children are a social question and a
Enter Input : question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has
Enter Input : another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they
Enter Input : suggest the institution of the family. We'll speak of children later,
Enter Input : but now as to the question of honour, I confess that's my weak point.
Enter Input : That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the
Enter Input : dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It's nonsense,
Enter Input : there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural
Enter Input : consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.
Enter Input : So that indeed it's not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an
Enter Input : absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of
Enter Input : it. I should say to my wife: 'My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now
Enter Input : I respect you, for you've shown you can protest!' You laugh! That's
Enter Input : because you are of incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound
Enter Input : it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived
Enter Input : in a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable consequence of a
Enter Input : despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is
Enter Input : open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it's unthinkable.
Enter Input : Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you
Enter Input : incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for
Enter Input : her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,
Enter Input : pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it's just the same,
Enter Input : I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for
Enter Input : herself. 'My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but even more than that I
Enter Input : desire you to respect me. See!' Am I not right?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.
Enter Input : He hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and
Enter Input : even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited
Enter Input : and rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected
Enter Input : upon it afterwards.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the
Enter Input : idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna's disordered brain.
Enter Input : Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's
Enter Input : funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to
Enter Input : honour the memory of the deceased "suitably," that all the lodgers,
Enter Input : and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know "that he was in no way their
Enter Input : inferior, and perhaps very much their superior," and that no one had the
Enter Input : right "to turn up his nose at him." Perhaps the chief element was that
Enter Input : peculiar "poor man's pride," which compels many poor people to spend
Enter Input : their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order
Enter Input : to do "like other people," and not to "be looked down upon." It is very
Enter Input : probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at
Enter Input : the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those
Enter Input : "wretched contemptible lodgers" that she knew "how to do things, how
Enter Input : to entertain" and that she had been brought up "in a genteel, she might
Enter Input : almost say aristocratic colonel's family" and had not been meant for
Enter Input : sweeping floors and washing the children's rags at night. Even the
Enter Input : poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these
Enter Input : paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible
Enter Input : nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she
Enter Input : might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have
Enter Input : been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will
Enter Input : could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her
Enter Input : mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year
Enter Input : past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.
Enter Input : The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the
Enter Input : intellect.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine
Enter Input : there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest
Enter Input : quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and
Enter Input : honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of
Enter Input : pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen. Two samovars were
Enter Input : boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help
Enter Input : of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been
Enter Input : stranded at Madame Lippevechsel's. He promptly put himself at Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna's disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before
Enter Input : running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious
Enter Input : that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called
Enter Input : her "_Pani_." She was heartily sick of him before the end, though
Enter Input : she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this
Enter Input : "serviceable and magnanimous man." It was one of Katerina Ivanovna's
Enter Input : characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.
Enter Input : Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she
Enter Input : would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance
Enter Input : and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she
Enter Input : would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the
Enter Input : person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She
Enter Input : was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from
Enter Input : continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_
Enter Input : that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the
Enter Input : peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost
Enter Input : to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and
Enter Input : fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against
Enter Input : the wall.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary
Enter Input : respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart
Enter Input : and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,
Enter Input : to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her
Enter Input : kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone
Enter Input : herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the
Enter Input : table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses
Enter Input : were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,
Enter Input : but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,
Enter Input : feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and
Enter Input : a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some
Enter Input : pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for
Enter Input : some reason: "as though the table could not have been laid except by
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna!" She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. "Could she
Enter Input : be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,
Enter Input : and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!
Enter Input : Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna's father who had been a colonel and almost
Enter Input : a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then
Enter Input : anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been
Enter Input : allowed into the kitchen."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the
Enter Input : time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided
Enter Input : inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down
Enter Input : and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was
Enter Input : fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that
Enter Input : hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except
Enter Input : the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the
Enter Input : memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned
Enter Input : up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older
Enter Input : and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most
Enter Input : respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,
Enter Input : Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,
Enter Input : noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had
Enter Input : been a friend of her first husband's, and a guest in her father's
Enter Input : house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her
Enter Input : a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : exalted anyone's connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior
Enter Input : motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to
Enter Input : the consequence of the person praised. Probably "taking his cue" from
Enter Input : Luzhin, "that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up
Enter Input : either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness
Enter Input : and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a
Enter Input : friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Among those who failed to appear were "the genteel lady and her
Enter Input : old-maidish daughter," who had only been lodgers in the house for the
Enter Input : last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar
Enter Input : in Katerina Ivanovna's room, especially when Marmeladov had come
Enter Input : back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,
Enter Input : quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole
Enter Input : family out of doors, had shouted at her that they "were not worth the
Enter Input : foot" of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, "whose
Enter Input : foot she was not worth," and who had turned away haughtily when she
Enter Input : casually met them, so that they might know that "she was more noble in
Enter Input : her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice," and might see
Enter Input : that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to
Enter Input : make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father's
Enter Input : governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly
Enter Input : stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he
Enter Input : was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it
Enter Input : appeared that he had been "not himself" for the last two days. The party
Enter Input : consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and
Enter Input : a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt
Enter Input : abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the
Enter Input : post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone
Enter Input : at Amalia Ivanovna's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was
Enter Input : drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without
Enter Input : a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without
Enter Input : even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit
Enter Input : appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought
Enter Input : with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna's
Enter Input : and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna intensely. "For whom had they made all these preparations
Enter Input : then?" To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid
Enter Input : for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the
Enter Input : furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big
Enter Input : girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like
Enter Input : well-bred children's.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with
Enter Input : increased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with
Enter Input : special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing
Enter Input : to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who
Enter Input : were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the
Enter Input : latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen
Enter Input : for the end. All were seated at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
Enter Input : cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the
Enter Input : first place, because he was the one "educated visitor, and, as everyone
Enter Input : knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university," and
Enter Input : secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having
Enter Input : been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and
Enter Input : made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In
Enter Input : spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round
Enter Input : correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising
Enter Input : cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse
Enter Input : during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at
Enter Input : the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and
Enter Input : uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of
Enter Input : her landlady.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's all that cuckoo's fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!" Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. "Look at her, she's making round
Enter Input : eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can't understand.
Enter Input : Pfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that
Enter Input : cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone
Enter Input : to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being
Enter Input : here? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially
Enter Input : those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has
Enter Input : brought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those
Enter Input : wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever
Enter Input : poked his nose in here, I've never set eyes on them. What have they come
Enter Input : here for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!" she cried
Enter Input : suddenly to one of them, "have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!
Enter Input : Have some beer! Won't you have some vodka? Look, he's jumped up and is
Enter Input : making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,
Enter Input : let them eat! They don't make a noise, anyway, though I'm really afraid
Enter Input : for our landlady's silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!" she addressed her
Enter Input : suddenly, almost aloud, "if your spoons should happen to be stolen,
Enter Input : I won't be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!" She laughed turning to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her
Enter Input : sally. "She didn't understand, she didn't understand again! Look how
Enter Input : she sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,
Enter Input : ha-ha-ha!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that
Enter Input : lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead
Enter Input : and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov
Enter Input : the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began
Enter Input : whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her
Enter Input : cheeks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,
Enter Input : for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am
Enter Input : speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she
Enter Input : has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that
Enter Input : provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and
Enter Input : has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the
Enter Input : government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody
Enter Input : knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has
Enter Input : not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners
Enter Input : required! I can't understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But
Enter Input : where's Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,
Enter Input : Sonia, where have you been? It's odd that even at your father's funeral
Enter Input : you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her
Enter Input : beside you. That's your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of
Enter Input : the cold entrée with jelly, that's the best. They'll bring the pancakes
Enter Input : directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got
Enter Input : everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That's all right. Be a good girl, Lida,
Enter Input : and, Kolya, don't fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.
Enter Input : What are you saying, Sonia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying to
Enter Input : speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most
Enter Input : respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added
Enter Input : that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as
Enter Input : he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone
Enter Input : with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her
Enter Input : and gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a
Enter Input : hurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time
Enter Input : she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed
Enter Input : absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying
Enter Input : to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get
Enter Input : mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her
Enter Input : only dress, a dark striped cotton one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to
Enter Input : Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to
Enter Input : Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch's position and standing to find himself in such
Enter Input : "extraordinary company," in spite of his devotion to her family and his
Enter Input : old friendship with her father.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have
Enter Input : not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings," she added
Enter Input : almost aloud. "But I am sure that it was only your special affection for
Enter Input : my poor husband that has made you keep your promise."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and
Enter Input : suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: "Wouldn't he
Enter Input : have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?" The old man made
Enter Input : no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,
Enter Input : though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He
Enter Input : simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the
Enter Input : general mirth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him," Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : continued, "and, of course, he is not like..." with an extremely stern
Enter Input : face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter
Enter Input : was quite disconcerted, "not like your dressed up draggletails whom
Enter Input : my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late
Enter Input : husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the
Enter Input : goodness of his heart."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!" cried the
Enter Input : commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows
Enter Input : it," Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, "but he was a kind and
Enter Input : honourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was
Enter Input : his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he
Enter Input : drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you
Enter Input : believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his
Enter Input : pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A cock? Did you say a cock?" shouted the commissariat clerk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in
Enter Input : thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him," she
Enter Input : went on, addressing Raskolnikov. "But that's not so! He respected me, he
Enter Input : respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was
Enter Input : for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to
Enter Input : feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would
Enter Input : think to myself: 'Be kind to him and he will drink again,' it was only
Enter Input : by severity that you could keep him within bounds."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often," roared the
Enter Input : commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having
Enter Input : their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!" Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna snapped at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In
Enter Input : another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the
Enter Input : visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the
Enter Input : commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently
Enter Input : trying to egg him on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me to ask what are you alluding to," began the clerk, "that is
Enter Input : to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don't care!
Enter Input : That's nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he took another drink of vodka.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from
Enter Input : politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually
Enter Input : putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia
Enter Input : intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,
Enter Input : too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with
Enter Input : terror Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,
Enter Input : was the chief reason for the 'genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment of
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that
Enter Input : the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the
Enter Input : question: "How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young
Enter Input : person_?" Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard
Enter Input : this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an
Enter Input : insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, "till she had shown those
Enter Input : draggletails that they were both..." To make matters worse someone
Enter Input : passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts
Enter Input : pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed
Enter Input : crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it
Enter Input : was "a drunken ass!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time
Enter Input : deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna's haughtiness, and to restore the
Enter Input : good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,
Enter Input : apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers "Karl
Enter Input : from the chemist's," who was driving one night in a cab, and that "the
Enter Input : cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,
Enter Input : and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his
Enter Input : heart." Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was
Enter Input : still more offended, and she retorted that her "_Vater aus Berlin_ was a
Enter Input : very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets." Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia
Enter Input : Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen to the owl!" Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her
Enter Input : good-humour almost restored, "she meant to say he kept his hands in
Enter Input : his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people's pockets.
Enter Input : (Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these
Enter Input : Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than
Enter Input : we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how 'Karl from the chemist's'
Enter Input : 'pierced his heart from fear' and that the idiot, instead of punishing
Enter Input : the cabman, 'clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.' Ah, the fool!
Enter Input : And you know she fancies it's very touching and does not suspect how
Enter Input : stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great
Enter Input : deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with
Enter Input : drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved
Enter Input : and serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!
Enter Input : (Cough-cough-cough.)"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling
Enter Input : Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open
Enter Input : a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.
Enter Input : This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she
Enter Input : launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of
Enter Input : which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told
Enter Input : him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance
Enter Input : before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This
Enter Input : certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself
Enter Input : with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming "those two stuck-up
Enter Input : draggletails" if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably
Enter Input : that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, "she might even say
Enter Input : aristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was far superior to
Enter Input : certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late." The
Enter Input : certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken
Enter Input : guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually
Enter Input : contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the
Enter Input : rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really
Enter Input : was almost the daughter of a colonel.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and
Enter Input : happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom
Enter Input : she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most
Enter Input : respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt
Enter Input : teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would
Enter Input : go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at
Enter Input : the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of
Enter Input : it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of
Enter Input : Sonia's undoubted ability to assist her, of "her gentleness, patience,
Enter Input : devotion, generosity and good education," tapping Sonia on the cheek and
Enter Input : kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was "nervous
Enter Input : and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and
Enter Input : as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
Enter Input : the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,
Enter Input : and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
Enter Input : observation, that "in the future boarding-school she would have to pay
Enter Input : particular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a
Enter Input : good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies
Enter Input : must not novels at night read."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as
Enter Input : heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying
Enter Input : "she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the
Enter Input : business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class
Enter Input : boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,
Enter Input : that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent." Amalia
Enter Input : Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only "meant her
Enter Input : good," and that "she had meant her very good," and that "it was long
Enter Input : since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna at once "set her down," saying that it was a lie to
Enter Input : say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband
Enter Input : was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those
Enter Input : ladies, but "those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_
Enter Input : ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady." Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge
Enter Input : what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her
Enter Input : "_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in
Enter Input : pockets went, and always used to say: 'Poof! poof!'" and she leapt
Enter Input : up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her
Enter Input : pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling "poof!
Enter Input : poof!" amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,
Enter Input : so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a
Enter Input : father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once
Enter Input : been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red
Enter Input : as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a
Enter Input : father, "but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat
Enter Input : and always said poof-poof-poof!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
Enter Input : was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print
Enter Input : that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father--if she
Enter Input : really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she
Enter Input : never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name
Enter Input : was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,
Enter Input : and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, "that
Enter Input : her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister." Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice
Enter Input : (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that "if she
Enter Input : dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a
Enter Input : level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her
Enter Input : head and trample it under foot." Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,
Enter Input : shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and
Enter Input : that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she
Enter Input : rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
Enter Input : There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia
Enter Input : ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted
Enter Input : something about "the yellow ticket," Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia
Enter Input : away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared
Enter Input : on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant
Enter Input : eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pyotr Petrovitch," she cried, "protect me... you at least! Make this
Enter Input : foolish woman understand that she can't behave like this to a lady in
Enter Input : misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I'll go to the
Enter Input : governor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my
Enter Input : father's hospitality protect these orphans."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me, madam.... Allow me." Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. "Your
Enter Input : papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing" (someone
Enter Input : laughed aloud) "and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting
Enter Input : squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own
Enter Input : affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...
Enter Input : Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia
Enter Input : was.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though
Enter Input : thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny
Enter Input : having enjoyed her father's hospitality. Though she had invented it
Enter Input : herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too
Enter Input : by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not
Enter Input : only was this "serious business man" strikingly incongruous with the
Enter Input : rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some
Enter Input : matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him
Enter Input : and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing
Enter Input : beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not
Enter Input : seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the
Enter Input : doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked
Enter Input : interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's a matter of
Enter Input : some importance," Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company
Enter Input : generally. "I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia
Enter Input : Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful
Enter Input : attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,"
Enter Input : he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already
Enter Input : alarmed, "immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble
Enter Input : note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where
Enter Input : it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to
Enter Input : witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be
Enter Input : compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must
Enter Input : blame yourself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were
Enter Input : still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a
Enter Input : word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, how is it to be then?" asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know.... I know nothing about it," Sonia articulated faintly at
Enter Input : last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, you know nothing?" Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some
Enter Input : seconds. "Think a moment, mademoiselle," he began severely, but still,
Enter Input : as it were, admonishing her. "Reflect, I am prepared to give you time
Enter Input : for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely
Enter Input : convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to
Enter Input : accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before
Enter Input : witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense
Enter Input : be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for
Enter Input : my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of
Enter Input : approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my
Enter Input : pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three
Enter Input : hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
Enter Input : About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three
Enter Input : notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my
Enter Input : invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly
Enter Input : embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the
Enter Input : conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness
Enter Input : to this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm
Enter Input : my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in
Enter Input : order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your
Enter Input : relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),
Enter Input : and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a
Enter Input : subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and
Enter Input : even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to
Enter Input : recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest
Enter Input : detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from
Enter Input : the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part
Enter Input : for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then
Enter Input : I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of
Enter Input : embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I
Enter Input : talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I
Enter Input : returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count
Enter Input : it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one
Enter Input : hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.
Enter Input : Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such
Enter Input : a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the
Enter Input : minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the
Enter Input : total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your
Enter Input : eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some
Enter Input : time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position
Enter Input : and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and
Enter Input : positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a
Enter Input : cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in
Enter Input : spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in
Enter Input : making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have
Enter Input : taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing
Enter Input : to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your
Enter Input : destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and
Enter Input : you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too
Enter Input : bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg
Enter Input : you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you
Enter Input : are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have taken nothing," Sonia whispered in terror, "you gave me ten
Enter Input : roubles, here it is, take it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,
Enter Input : took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?" he insisted
Enter Input : reproachfully, not taking the note.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,
Enter Input : ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against
Enter Input : the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good God!" broke from Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore
Enter Input : I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter," Luzhin said
Enter Input : softly and even kindly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief," cried Amalia
Enter Input : Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You knew it?" Luzhin caught her up, "then I suppose you had some reason
Enter Input : before this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to
Enter Input : remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in
Enter Input : movement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and
Enter Input : she rushed at Luzhin. "What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the
Enter Input : wretches, the wretches!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as
Enter Input : in a vise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it
Enter Input : to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and
Enter Input : flung it straight into Luzhin's face. It hit him in the eye and fell
Enter Input : on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : lost his temper.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hold that mad woman!" he shouted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in
Enter Input : the doorway, among them the two ladies.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!" shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. "You are an
Enter Input : idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his
Enter Input : money! Sonia a thief! Why, she'd give away her last penny!" and Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. "Did you ever see such an
Enter Input : idiot?" she turned from side to side. "And you too?" she suddenly saw
Enter Input : the landlady, "and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a
Enter Input : thief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a crinoline! She hasn't been
Enter Input : out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down
Enter Input : beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search
Enter Input : her! Since she's not left the room, the money would have to be on her!
Enter Input : Search her, search her! But if you don't find it, then excuse me, my
Enter Input : dear fellow, you'll answer for it! I'll go to our Sovereign, to our
Enter Input : Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,
Enter Input : to-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do
Enter Input : you think they wouldn't? You're wrong, I will get in! I will get in!
Enter Input : You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so
Enter Input : submissive, let me tell you! You've gone too far yourself. Search her,
Enter Input : search her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards
Enter Input : Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am ready, I'll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm
Enter Input : yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to
Enter Input : that..." Luzhin muttered, "that ought to be before the police... though
Enter Input : indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in
Enter Input : any case it's difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with
Enter Input : the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it's not the way to do
Enter Input : things.... How is it to be done?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
Enter Input : "Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,
Enter Input : here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D'you see,
Enter Input : d'you see?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside
Enter Input : out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing
Enter Input : a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin's feet. Everyone saw it, several
Enter Input : cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two
Enter Input : fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a
Enter Input : hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note
Enter Input : showing it to everyone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!" yelled Amalia Ivanovna.
Enter Input : "They must to Siberia be sent! Away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his
Enter Input : eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.
Enter Input : Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel
Enter Input : surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry
Enter Input : and hid her face in her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it wasn't I! I didn't take it! I know nothing about it," she cried
Enter Input : with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped
Enter Input : her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the
Enter Input : world.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! You see, I don't believe it!" she
Enter Input : cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her
Enter Input : arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her
Enter Input : hands and kissing them, too, "you took it! How stupid these people are!
Enter Input : Oh dear! You are fools, fools," she cried, addressing the whole room,
Enter Input : "you don't know, you don't know what a heart she has, what a girl she
Enter Input : is! She take it, she? She'd sell her last rag, she'd go barefoot to help
Enter Input : you if you needed it, that's what she is! She has the yellow passport
Enter Input : because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,
Enter Input : husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!
Enter Input : Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch, why don't you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You
Enter Input : are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend
Enter Input : her now, at least!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a
Enter Input : great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,
Enter Input : the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained
Enter Input : as a child's, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help
Enter Input : were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch
Enter Input : at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!" he cried
Enter Input : impressively, "no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an
Enter Input : instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved
Enter Input : her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous
Enter Input : idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,
Enter Input : so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to
Enter Input : confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?
Enter Input : You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how
Enter Input : could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen," he
Enter Input : addressed the whole company, "gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,
Enter Input : commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite
Enter Input : of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a
Enter Input : lesson to you for the future," he said, addressing Sonia, "and I will
Enter Input : carry the matter no further. Enough!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the
Enter Input : fire in Raskolnikov's seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging
Enter Input : Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on
Enter Input : all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was
Enter Input : wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty
Enter Input : little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia's shoulder.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How vile!" a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What vileness!" Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the
Enter Input : face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it
Enter Input : afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you dared to call me as witness?" he said, going up to Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean? What are you talking about?" muttered Luzhin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I mean that you... are a slanderer, that's what my words mean!"
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted
Enter Input : eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though
Enter Input : seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If you mean that for me,..." he began, stammering. "But what's the
Enter Input : matter with you? Are you out of your mind?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard
Enter Input : everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own
Enter Input : even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I
Enter Input : can't understand."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical
Enter Input : riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch
Enter Input : vodka, for it's against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he
Enter Input : himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble
Enter Input : note--I saw it, I was a witness, I'll take my oath! He did it, he!"
Enter Input : repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you crazy, milksop?" squealed Luzhin. "She is herself before
Enter Input : you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her
Enter Input : only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I saw it, I saw it," Lebeziatnikov repeated, "and though it is against
Enter Input : my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like
Enter Input : before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only
Enter Input : like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying
Enter Input : good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with
Enter Input : the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I
Enter Input : saw it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Luzhin turned pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What lies!" he cried impudently, "why, how could you, standing by the
Enter Input : window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You
Enter Input : are raving!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I didn't fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw
Enter Input : it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from
Enter Input : the window--that's true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble
Enter Input : note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,
Enter Input : you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I
Enter Input : was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not
Enter Input : forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand
Enter Input : all the time. I didn't think of it again until, when you were getting
Enter Input : up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped
Enter Input : it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant
Enter Input : to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you
Enter Input : and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I
Enter Input : saw it, I'll take my oath."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands
Enter Input : chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all
Enter Input : crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her
Enter Input : part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees
Enter Input : before him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A pack of nonsense!" yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, "it's all nonsense
Enter Input : you've been talking! 'An idea struck you, you didn't think, you
Enter Input : noticed'--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on
Enter Input : purpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What for? That's what I can't understand, but that what I am telling
Enter Input : you is the fact, that's certain! So far from my being mistaken, you
Enter Input : infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question
Enter Input : occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing
Enter Input : your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it
Enter Input : secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that
Enter Input : my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private
Enter Input : benevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you
Enter Input : really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,
Enter Input : too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole
Enter Input : hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people
Enter Input : are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then
Enter Input : the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,
Enter Input : when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you
Enter Input : wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand
Enter Input : should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so
Enter Input : many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it
Enter Input : indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck
Enter Input : me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she
Enter Input : noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of
Enter Input : the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.
Enter Input : But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov's to take them the
Enter Input : 'General Treatise on the Positive Method' and especially to recommend
Enter Input : Piderit's article (and also Wagner's); then I come on here and what a
Enter Input : state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and
Enter Input : reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her
Enter Input : pocket?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical
Enter Input : deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed
Enter Input : from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly
Enter Input : in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite
Enter Input : exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech
Enter Input : produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such
Enter Input : conviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt
Enter Input : that things were going badly with him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?" he shouted,
Enter Input : "that's no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that's all! And I tell you,
Enter Input : you are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against
Enter Input : me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,
Enter Input : godless, social propositions!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval
Enter Input : were heard on all sides.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, that's your line now, is it!" cried Lebeziatnikov, "that's
Enter Input : nonsense! Call the police and I'll take my oath! There's only one thing
Enter Input : I can't understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,
Enter Input : pitiful, despicable man!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,
Enter Input : will swear to it," Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he
Enter Input : stepped forward.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the
Enter Input : very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would
Enter Input : be solved.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now I can explain it all to myself," said Raskolnikov, addressing
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov. "From the very beginning of the business, I suspected
Enter Input : that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began
Enter Input : to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which
Enter Input : I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your
Enter Input : valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,
Enter Input : all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently
Enter Input : engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day
Enter Input : before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I
Enter Input : have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day
Enter Input : before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,
Enter Input : and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before
Enter Input : yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,
Enter Input : as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to
Enter Input : my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not
Enter Input : to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most
Enter Input : contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,
Enter Input : hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you
Enter Input : understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,
Enter Input : by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money
Enter Input : which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,
Enter Input : before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had
Enter Input : given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had
Enter Input : never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,
Enter Input : Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna's little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his
Enter Input : question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I
Enter Input : answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother
Enter Input : and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he
Enter Input : gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took
Enter Input : place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday
Enter Input : evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now
Enter Input : succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would
Enter Input : have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his
Enter Input : suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on
Enter Input : a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting
Enter Input : and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might
Enter Input : even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,
Enter Input : and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing
Enter Input : of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing
Enter Input : that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to
Enter Input : me. That was what he was working for! That's how I understand it. That's
Enter Input : the whole reason for it and there can be no other!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his
Enter Input : speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by
Enter Input : exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke
Enter Input : clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of
Enter Input : conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, that's it," Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, "that must be
Enter Input : it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,
Enter Input : whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna's
Enter Input : guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was
Enter Input : essential for him that you should be here! That's it, that's it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He
Enter Input : seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have
Enter Input : been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this
Enter Input : was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of
Enter Input : the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had
Enter Input : already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The
Enter Input : commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,
Enter Input : was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very
Enter Input : unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came
Enter Input : in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited
Enter Input : and were continually shouting at him: "The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!" and
Enter Input : muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained
Enter Input : attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as
Enter Input : though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her
Enter Input : eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth
Enter Input : wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr
Enter Input : Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.
Enter Input : Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
Enter Input : But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of
Enter Input : Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don't squeeze, let me pass!" he said,
Enter Input : making his way through the crowd. "And no threats, if you please! I
Enter Input : assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the
Enter Input : contrary, you'll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing
Enter Input : the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I
Enter Input : shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and
Enter Input : will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and
Enter Input : atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are
Enter Input : foolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and
Enter Input : everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I've
Enter Input : been taking, the way I've been expounding... all this fortnight!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;
Enter Input : now I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor
Enter Input : for your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to
Enter Input : let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished
Enter Input : it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew
Enter Input : straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,
Enter Input : fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room
Enter Input : and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had
Enter Input : felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than
Enter Input : anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that
Enter Input : moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,
Enter Input : gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was
Enter Input : too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without
Enter Input : murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too
Enter Input : bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first
Enter Input : terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all
Enter Input : clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
Enter Input : made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical
Enter Input : weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room
Enter Input : and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin's departure. When amidst
Enter Input : loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the
Enter Input : landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay
Enter Input : her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the
Enter Input : floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,
Enter Input : jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at
Enter Input : Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her
Enter Input : away like a feather.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature
Enter Input : attacks me! What! On the day of my husband's funeral I am turned out of
Enter Input : my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,
Enter Input : with my orphans! Where am I to go?" wailed the poor woman, sobbing and
Enter Input : gasping. "Good God!" she cried with flashing eyes, "is there no justice
Enter Input : upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!
Enter Input : There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,
Enter Input : godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I'll come back. Wait
Enter Input : for me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is
Enter Input : justice on earth!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had
Enter Input : mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the
Enter Input : disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,
Enter Input : wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention
Enter Input : of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little
Enter Input : ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the
Enter Input : room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia
Enter Input : Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing
Enter Input : everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked
Enter Input : incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had
Enter Input : happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others
Enter Input : struck up a song....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now it's time for me to go," thought Raskolnikov. "Well, Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against
Enter Input : Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own
Enter Input : heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort
Enter Input : of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal
Enter Input : feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,
Enter Input : especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview
Enter Input : with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the
Enter Input : terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the
Enter Input : thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna's, "Well,
Enter Input : Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!" he was still
Enter Input : superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over
Enter Input : Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia's lodging, he
Enter Input : felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the
Enter Input : door, asking himself the strange question: "Must he tell her who killed
Enter Input : Lizaveta?" It was a strange question because he felt at the very time
Enter Input : not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could
Enter Input : not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he
Enter Input : only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before
Enter Input : the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and
Enter Input : suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the
Enter Input : doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in
Enter Input : her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet
Enter Input : him as though she were expecting him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What would have become of me but for you?" she said quickly, meeting
Enter Input : him in the middle of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been
Enter Input : waiting for.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she
Enter Input : had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she
Enter Input : had done the day before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, Sonia?" he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, "it was
Enter Input : all due to 'your social position and the habits associated with it.' Did
Enter Input : you understand that just now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her face showed her distress.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday," she interrupted him.
Enter Input : "Please don't begin it. There is misery enough without that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I
Enter Input : wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging
Enter Input : and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere "to seek justice."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "My God!" cried Sonia, "let's go at once...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she snatched up her cape.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's everlastingly the same thing!" said Raskolnikov, irritably.
Enter Input : "You've no thought except for them! Stay a little with me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But... Katerina Ivanovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she'll come to you
Enter Input : herself since she has run out," he added peevishly. "If she doesn't find
Enter Input : you here, you'll be blamed for it...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at
Enter Input : the floor and deliberating.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you," he began, not looking
Enter Input : at Sonia, "but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would
Enter Input : have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.
Enter Input : Ah?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," she assented in a faint voice. "Yes," she repeated, preoccupied
Enter Input : and distressed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov's turning up."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia was silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And if you'd gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said
Enter Input : yesterday?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again she did not answer. He waited.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I thought you would cry out again 'don't speak of it, leave off.'"
Enter Input : Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. "What, silence
Enter Input : again?" he asked a minute later. "We must talk about something, you
Enter Input : know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a
Enter Input : certain 'problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say." (He was beginning to lose
Enter Input : the thread.) "No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had
Enter Input : known all Luzhin's intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,
Enter Input : that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and
Enter Input : yourself thrown in--since you don't count yourself for anything--Polenka
Enter Input : too... for she'll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on
Enter Input : your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether
Enter Input : Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna
Enter Input : should die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this
Enter Input : hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout
Enter Input : way.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I felt that you were going to ask some question like that," she said,
Enter Input : looking inquisitively at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why do you ask about what could not happen?" said Sonia reluctantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked
Enter Input : things? You haven't dared to decide even that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I can't know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what
Enter Input : can't be answered? What's the use of such foolish questions? How could
Enter Input : it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge
Enter Input : to decide who is to live and who is not to live?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing
Enter Input : anything," Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'd better say straight out what you want!" Sonia cried in distress.
Enter Input : "You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to
Enter Input : torture me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at
Enter Input : her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course you're right, Sonia," he said softly at last. He was suddenly
Enter Input : changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
Enter Input : Even his voice was suddenly weak. "I told you yesterday that I was not
Enter Input : coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to ask
Enter Input : forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.
Enter Input : I was asking forgiveness, Sonia...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in
Enter Input : his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred
Enter Input : for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened
Enter Input : of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he
Enter Input : met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was
Enter Input : love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real
Enter Input : feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that
Enter Input : _that_ minute had come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he
Enter Input : turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without
Enter Input : uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had
Enter Input : stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that "he must
Enter Input : not lose another minute."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter?" asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he
Enter Input : had intended to "tell" and he did not understand what was happening to
Enter Input : him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and
Enter Input : waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It
Enter Input : was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,
Enter Input : helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed
Enter Input : through Sonia's heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the matter?" she repeated, drawing a little away from him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing, Sonia, don't be frightened.... It's nonsense. It really is
Enter Input : nonsense, if you think of it," he muttered, like a man in delirium. "Why
Enter Input : have I come to torture you?" he added suddenly, looking at her. "Why,
Enter Input : really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour
Enter Input : before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and
Enter Input : feeling a continual tremor all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, how you are suffering!" she muttered in distress, looking intently
Enter Input : at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia." He suddenly smiled, a pale
Enter Input : helpless smile for two seconds. "You remember what I meant to tell you
Enter Input : yesterday?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia waited uneasily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but
Enter Input : that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She began trembling all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, here I've come to tell you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you really meant it yesterday?" she whispered with difficulty.
Enter Input : "How do you know?" she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her
Enter Input : reason.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia's face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She paused a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have they found him?" she asked timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then how do you know about _it_?" she asked again, hardly audibly and
Enter Input : again after a minute's pause.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Guess," he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A shudder passed over her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you... why do you frighten me like this?" she said, smiling like a
Enter Input : child.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know," Raskolnikov went
Enter Input : on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes
Enter Input : away. "He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her
Enter Input : accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and
Enter Input : he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You can't guess, then?" he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were
Enter Input : flinging himself down from a steeple.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no..." whispered Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Take a good look."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his
Enter Input : heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the
Enter Input : face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta's
Enter Input : face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the
Enter Input : wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking
Enter Input : as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,
Enter Input : looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and
Enter Input : holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same
Enter Input : thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same
Enter Input : terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left
Enter Input : hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to
Enter Input : get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed
Enter Input : even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear
Enter Input : showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost
Enter Input : with the same _childish_ smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you guessed?" he whispered at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good God!" broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a
Enter Input : moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands
Enter Input : and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his
Enter Input : face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she
Enter Input : tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;
Enter Input : there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when
Enter Input : she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she
Enter Input : had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for
Enter Input : instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as
Enter Input : soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen
Enter Input : this very thing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stop, Sonia, enough! don't torture me," he begged her miserably.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,
Enter Input : but this is how it happened.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her
Enter Input : hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat
Enter Input : down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden
Enter Input : she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on
Enter Input : her knees before him, she did not know why.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What have you done--what have you done to yourself?" she said in
Enter Input : despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms
Enter Input : round him, and held him tightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you
Enter Input : about that.... You don't think what you are doing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!" she
Enter Input : cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into
Enter Input : violent hysterical weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at
Enter Input : once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes
Enter Input : and hung on his eyelashes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you won't leave me, Sonia?" he said, looking at her almost with
Enter Input : hope.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no, never, nowhere!" cried Sonia. "I will follow you, I will follow
Enter Input : you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn't I
Enter Input : know you before! Why didn't you come before? Oh, dear!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here I have come."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, now! What's to be done now?... Together, together!" she repeated
Enter Input : as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. "I'll follow you to
Enter Input : Siberia!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to
Enter Input : his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps I don't want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia," he said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia looked at him quickly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man
Enter Input : the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she
Enter Input : seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She
Enter Input : knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all
Enter Input : these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not
Enter Input : believe it: "He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's the meaning of it? Where am I?" she said in complete
Enter Input : bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. "How could you,
Enter Input : you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does
Enter Input : it mean?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia," he answered wearily, almost
Enter Input : with vexation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Sonia, no," he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. "I was
Enter Input : not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that's
Enter Input : not the real thing either.... Don't torture me, Sonia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia clasped her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could
Enter Input : believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet
Enter Input : rob and murder! Ah," she cried suddenly, "that money you gave Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Sonia," he broke in hurriedly, "that money was not it. Don't worry
Enter Input : yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the
Enter Input : day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....
Enter Input : That money was mine--my own."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And _that_ money.... I don't even know really whether there was any
Enter Input : money," he added softly, as though reflecting. "I took a purse off her
Enter Input : neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...
Enter Input : but I didn't look in it; I suppose I hadn't time.... And the
Enter Input : things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next
Enter Input : morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia strained every nerve to listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?" she
Enter Input : asked quickly, catching at a straw.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know.... I haven't yet decided whether to take that money or
Enter Input : not," he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he
Enter Input : gave a brief ironical smile. "Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he mad? But she
Enter Input : dismissed it at once. "No, it was something else." She could make
Enter Input : nothing of it, nothing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know, Sonia," he said suddenly with conviction, "let me tell
Enter Input : you: if I'd simply killed because I was hungry," laying stress on
Enter Input : every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, "I should
Enter Input : be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you," he
Enter Input : cried a moment later with a sort of despair, "what would it matter to
Enter Input : you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such
Enter Input : a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've come to you
Enter Input : to-day?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Go where?" asked Sonia timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious," he smiled bitterly.
Enter Input : "We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it's only now, only this
Enter Input : moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!
Enter Input : Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one
Enter Input : thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won't leave me,
Enter Input : Sonia?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She squeezed his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?" he cried a minute
Enter Input : later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. "Here you expect
Enter Input : an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see
Enter Input : that. But what can I tell you? You won't understand and will only suffer
Enter Input : misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.
Enter Input : Why do you do it? Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come to
Enter Input : throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can
Enter Input : you love such a mean wretch?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But aren't you suffering, too?" cried Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an
Enter Input : instant softened it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great
Enter Input : deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn't have
Enter Input : come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That's
Enter Input : not the point. I must speak now, but I don't know how to begin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He paused and sank into thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, we are so different," he cried again, "we are not alike. And why,
Enter Input : why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no, it was a good thing you came," cried Sonia. "It's better I
Enter Input : should know, far better!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked at her with anguish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What if it were really that?" he said, as though reaching a conclusion.
Enter Input : "Yes, that's what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I
Enter Input : killed her.... Do you understand now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no," Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. "Only speak, speak, I shall
Enter Input : understand, I shall understand _in myself_!" she kept begging him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'll understand? Very well, we shall see!" He paused and was for some
Enter Input : time lost in meditation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if
Enter Input : Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had
Enter Input : not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his
Enter Input : career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,
Enter Input : there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had
Enter Input : to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you
Enter Input : understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had
Enter Input : been no other means? Wouldn't he have felt a pang at its being so far
Enter Input : from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I
Enter Input : worried myself fearfully over that 'question' so that I was awfully
Enter Input : ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would
Enter Input : not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck
Enter Input : him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there
Enter Input : was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,
Enter Input : he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!
Enter Input : Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following
Enter Input : his example. And that's exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,
Enter Input : Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that's just how it
Enter Input : was."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia did not think it at all funny.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You had better tell me straight out... without examples," she begged,
Enter Input : still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are right again, Sonia. Of course that's all nonsense, it's almost
Enter Input : all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely
Enter Input : anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned
Enter Input : to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a
Enter Input : student, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forced
Enter Input : for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten
Enter Input : or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or
Enter Input : clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles" (he repeated it as though it
Enter Input : were a lesson) "and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief
Enter Input : and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my
Enter Input : sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it's a hard
Enter Input : thing to pass everything by all one's life, to turn one's back upon
Enter Input : everything, to forget one's mother and decorously accept the insults
Enter Input : inflicted on one's sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to
Enter Input : burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again
Enter Input : without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman's
Enter Input : money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,
Enter Input : to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving
Enter Input : it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up
Enter Input : a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
Enter Input : Well... that's all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did
Enter Input : wrong.... Well, that's enough."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head
Enter Input : sink.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, that's not it, that's not it," Sonia cried in distress. "How could
Enter Input : one... no, that's not right, not right."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You see yourself that it's not right. But I've spoken truly, it's the
Enter Input : truth."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As though that could be the truth! Good God!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful
Enter Input : creature."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A human being--a louse!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I too know it wasn't a louse," he answered, looking strangely at
Enter Input : her. "But I am talking nonsense, Sonia," he added. "I've been talking
Enter Input : nonsense a long time.... That's not it, you are right there. There were
Enter Input : quite, quite other causes for it! I haven't talked to anyone for so
Enter Input : long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an
Enter Input : uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen
Enter Input : through his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too
Enter Input : was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow
Enter Input : comprehensible, but yet... "But how, how! Good God!" And she wrung her
Enter Input : hands in despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Sonia, that's not it," he began again suddenly, raising his head,
Enter Input : as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were
Enter Input : roused him--"that's not it! Better... imagine--yes, it's certainly
Enter Input : better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive
Enter Input : and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let's have it all out
Enter Input : at once! They've talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just
Enter Input : now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that
Enter Input : perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed
Enter Input : for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,
Enter Input : no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I
Enter Input : turned sulky and wouldn't. (Yes, sulkiness, that's the right word for
Enter Input : it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You've been in my den, you've seen
Enter Input : it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp
Enter Input : the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn't
Enter Input : go out of it! I wouldn't on purpose! I didn't go out for days together,
Enter Input : and I wouldn't work, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doing
Enter Input : nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn't, I
Enter Input : went all day without; I wouldn't ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At
Enter Input : night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn't earn money for
Enter Input : candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies
Enter Input : an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and
Enter Input : thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange
Enter Input : dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy
Enter Input : that... No, that's not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept
Enter Input : asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I
Enter Input : know they are--yet I won't be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one
Enter Input : waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I
Enter Input : understood that that would never come to pass, that men won't change and
Enter Input : that nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it.
Enter Input : Yes, that's so. That's the law of their nature, Sonia,... that's so!...
Enter Input : And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will
Enter Input : have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their
Enter Input : eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he
Enter Input : who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now
Enter Input : and so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared
Enter Input : whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he
Enter Input : was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without
Enter Input : talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his
Enter Input : faith and code.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I divined then, Sonia," he went on eagerly, "that power is only
Enter Input : vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only
Enter Input : one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first
Enter Input : time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever
Enter Input : thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is
Enter Input : that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to
Enter Input : go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted
Enter Input : _to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the
Enter Input : daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh hush, hush," cried Sonia, clasping her hands. "You turned away from
Enter Input : God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became
Enter Input : clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hush, don't laugh, blasphemer! You don't understand, you don't
Enter Input : understand! Oh God! He won't understand!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil
Enter Input : leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!" he repeated with gloomy insistence. "I
Enter Input : know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all
Enter Input : over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I've argued it all over with
Enter Input : myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how
Enter Input : sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it
Enter Input : and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don't
Enter Input : suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a
Enter Input : wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn't suppose that
Enter Input : I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether
Enter Input : I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn't the right--or that if
Enter Input : I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't
Enter Input : so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his
Enter Input : goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,
Enter Input : wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly
Enter Input : of course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that
Enter Input : battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder
Enter Input : without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn't
Enter Input : want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I did
Enter Input : the murder--that's nonsense--I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and
Enter Input : power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;
Enter Input : I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a
Enter Input : benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in
Enter Input : my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that
Enter Input : moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It
Enter Input : was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all
Enter Input : now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder
Enter Input : again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led
Enter Input : me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse
Enter Input : like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or
Enter Input : not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling
Enter Input : creature or whether I have the _right_..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To kill? Have the right to kill?" Sonia clasped her hands.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, Sonia!" he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,
Enter Input : but was contemptuously silent. "Don't interrupt me, Sonia. I want to
Enter Input : prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me
Enter Input : since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such
Enter Input : a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I've come to you
Enter Input : now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to
Enter Input : you? Listen: when I went then to the old woman's I only went to
Enter Input : _try_.... You may be sure of that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you murdered her!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to
Enter Input : commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!
Enter Input : Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself
Enter Input : once for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old
Enter Input : woman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!" he cried in a
Enter Input : sudden spasm of agony, "let me be!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as
Enter Input : in a vise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What suffering!" A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, what am I to do now?" he asked, suddenly raising his head and
Enter Input : looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you to do?" she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been
Enter Input : full of tears suddenly began to shine. "Stand up!" (She seized him by
Enter Input : the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) "Go at once,
Enter Input : this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the
Enter Input : earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say
Enter Input : to all men aloud, 'I am a murderer!' Then God will send you life again.
Enter Input : Will you go, will you go?" she asked him, trembling all over, snatching
Enter Input : his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes
Enter Input : full of fire.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?" he asked gloomily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that's what you must do."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No! I am not going to them, Sonia!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how will you go on living? What will you live for?" cried Sonia,
Enter Input : "how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what
Enter Input : will become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your
Enter Input : mother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,
Enter Input : God!" she cried, "why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by
Enter Input : himself! What will become of you now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be a child, Sonia," he said softly. "What wrong have I done
Enter Input : them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That's only a
Enter Input : phantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a
Enter Input : virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.
Enter Input : And what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to
Enter Input : take the money and hid it under a stone?" he added with a bitter smile.
Enter Input : "Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting
Enter Input : it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn't understand and they don't deserve
Enter Input : to understand. Why should I go to them? I won't. Don't be a child,
Enter Input : Sonia...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It will be too much for you to bear, too much!" she repeated, holding
Enter Input : out her hands in despairing supplication.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps I've been unfair to myself," he observed gloomily, pondering,
Enter Input : "perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I've been in too great
Enter Input : a hurry to condemn myself. I'll make another fight for it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A haughty smile appeared on his lips.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I shall get used to it," he said grimly and thoughtfully. "Listen," he
Enter Input : began a minute later, "stop crying, it's time to talk of the facts: I've
Enter Input : come to tell you that the police are after me, on my track...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach!" Sonia cried in terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are
Enter Input : frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall
Enter Input : make a struggle for it and they won't do anything to me. They've no real
Enter Input : evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but
Enter Input : to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained
Enter Input : two ways, that's to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do
Enter Input : you understand? And I shall, for I've learnt my lesson. But they will
Enter Input : certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,
Enter Input : they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will
Enter Input : arrest me to-day.... But that's no matter, Sonia; they'll let me out
Enter Input : again... for there isn't any real proof against me, and there won't be,
Enter Input : I give you my word for it. And they can't convict a man on what they
Enter Input : have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will
Enter Input : try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they
Enter Input : won't be frightened.... My sister's future is secure, however, now, I
Enter Input : believe... and my mother's must be too.... Well, that's all. Be careful,
Enter Input : though. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I will, I will."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had
Enter Input : been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at
Enter Input : Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he
Enter Input : felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a
Enter Input : strange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that
Enter Input : all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part
Enter Input : of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he
Enter Input : suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia," he said, "you'd better not come and see me when I am in
Enter Input : prison."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you a cross on you?" she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not at first understand the question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have
Enter Input : another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with
Enter Input : Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will
Enter Input : wear Lizaveta's now and give you this. Take it... it's mine! It's mine,
Enter Input : you know," she begged him. "We will go to suffer together, and together
Enter Input : we will bear our cross!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Give it me," said Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the
Enter Input : hand he held out for the cross.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not now, Sonia. Better later," he added to comfort her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, better," she repeated with conviction, "when you go to meet
Enter Input : your suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I'll put it on you,
Enter Input : we will pray and go together."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?" they heard in a very familiar and
Enter Input : polite voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've come to you, Sofya Semyonovna," he began. "Excuse me... I thought
Enter Input : I should find you," he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, "that is,
Enter Input : I didn't mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna has gone out of her mind," he blurted out suddenly, turning
Enter Input : from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia screamed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "At least it seems so. But... we don't know what to do, you see! She
Enter Input : came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps
Enter Input : beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father's former
Enter Input : chief, she didn't find him at home: he was dining at some other
Enter Input : general's.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general's,
Enter Input : and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to
Enter Input : see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what
Enter Input : happened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own
Enter Input : story, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe
Enter Input : it.... How it is she wasn't taken up, I can't understand! Now she is
Enter Input : telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it's difficult to
Enter Input : understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,
Enter Input : she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the
Enter Input : children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children
Enter Input : will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every
Enter Input : day under the general's window... 'to let everyone see well-born
Enter Input : children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.' She
Enter Input : keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida
Enter Input : to sing 'My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing
Enter Input : up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means
Enter Input : to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won't
Enter Input : listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It's beyond
Enter Input : anything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost
Enter Input : breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,
Enter Input : putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov came after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She has certainly gone mad!" he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out
Enter Input : into the street. "I didn't want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said
Enter Input : 'it seemed like it,' but there isn't a doubt of it. They say that in
Enter Input : consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity I
Enter Input : know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn't
Enter Input : listen."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did you talk to her about the tubercles?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn't have understood!
Enter Input : But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he
Enter Input : has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying. That's clear. Is it your
Enter Input : conviction that he won't?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Life would be too easy if it were so," answered Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have
Enter Input : been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the
Enter Input : insane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific
Enter Input : man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such
Enter Input : treatment. His idea was that there's nothing really wrong with the
Enter Input : physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a
Enter Input : logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He
Enter Input : gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they
Enter Input : say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far
Enter Input : success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at
Enter Input : least."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he
Enter Input : lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov
Enter Input : woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle
Enter Input : of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered
Enter Input : paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous
Enter Input : knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose
Enter Input : on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of
Enter Input : absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was
Enter Input : hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the
Enter Input : window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out
Enter Input : of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down
Enter Input : on the sofa.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now
Enter Input : that he had made her more miserable.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison
Enter Input : her life? Oh, the meanness of it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will remain alone," he said resolutely, "and she shall not come to
Enter Input : the prison!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a
Enter Input : strange thought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia," he thought suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging
Enter Input : through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At
Enter Input : first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he
Enter Input : had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place
Enter Input : as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost
Enter Input : vacantly at her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one minute," said Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.
Enter Input : He saw that she too had come to him with love.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and
Enter Input : told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a
Enter Input : stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that
Enter Input : there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such
Enter Input : horror. I don't think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must
Enter Input : be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That's
Enter Input : what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don't
Enter Input : judge you, I don't venture to judge you, and forgive me for having
Enter Input : blamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,
Enter Input : should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,
Enter Input : but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that
Enter Input : you will come very soon. Don't worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at
Enter Input : rest; but don't you try her too much--come once at least; remember that
Enter Input : she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say" (Dounia began
Enter Input : to get up) "that if you should need me or should need... all my life or
Enter Input : anything... call me, and I'll come. Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She turned abruptly and went towards the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia!" Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. "That Razumihin,
Enter Input : Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia flushed slightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well?" she asked, waiting a moment.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....
Enter Input : Good-bye, Dounia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that
Enter Input : you... give me such a parting message?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Never mind.... Good-bye."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at
Enter Input : him uneasily, and went out troubled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)
Enter Input : when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,
Enter Input : and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and
Enter Input : will feel that I stole her kiss."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And would _she_ stand that test?" he went on a few minutes later to
Enter Input : himself. "No, she wouldn't; girls like that can't stand things! They
Enter Input : never do."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he thought of Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was
Enter Input : fading. He took up his cap and went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all
Enter Input : this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And
Enter Input : if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this
Enter Input : continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession
Enter Input : of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had
Enter Input : begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute
Enter Input : about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;
Enter Input : it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a
Enter Input : foretaste of an eternity "on a square yard of space." Towards evening
Enter Input : this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or
Enter Input : something, one can't help doing something stupid! You'll go to Dounia,
Enter Input : as well as to Sonia," he muttered bitterly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Only fancy, I've been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she's
Enter Input : carried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and
Enter Input : I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making
Enter Input : the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the
Enter Input : cross-roads and in front of shops; there's a crowd of fools running
Enter Input : after them. Come along!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Sonia?" Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Simply frantic. That is, it's not Sofya Semyonovna's frantic, but
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova's frantic too. But Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They'll be
Enter Input : taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....
Enter Input : They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna's, quite close."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one
Enter Input : where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally
Enter Input : of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could
Enter Input : be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle
Enter Input : likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress
Enter Input : with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way
Enter Input : on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her
Enter Input : wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out
Enter Input : of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
Enter Input : But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew
Enter Input : more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed
Enter Input : them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began
Enter Input : explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by
Enter Input : their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the
Enter Input : crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she
Enter Input : immediately appealed to him to see what these children "from a genteel,
Enter Input : one may say aristocratic, house" had been brought to. If she heard
Enter Input : laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers
Enter Input : and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their
Enter Input : heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the
Enter Input : frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken
Enter Input : was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of
Enter Input : rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,
Enter Input : when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in
Enter Input : the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,
Enter Input : which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most
Enter Input : furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had
Enter Input : been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The
Enter Input : boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.
Enter Input : There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,
Enter Input : or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with
Enter Input : a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession.
Enter Input : Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her
Enter Input : mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her
Enter Input : mother's condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly
Enter Input : frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Leave off, Sonia, leave off," she shouted, speaking fast, panting and
Enter Input : coughing. "You don't know what you ask; you are like a child! I've
Enter Input : told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let
Enter Input : everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,
Enter Input : though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in
Enter Input : truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service." (Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly
Enter Input : believed it.) "Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,
Enter Input : Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I
Enter Input : won't go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?" she cried, seeing
Enter Input : Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. "Explain to this silly girl, please,
Enter Input : that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their
Enter Input : living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are
Enter Input : an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general
Enter Input : will lose his post, you'll see! We shall perform under his windows every
Enter Input : day, and if the Tsar drives by, I'll fall on my knees, put the children
Enter Input : before me, show them to him, and say 'Defend us father.' He is the
Enter Input : father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he'll protect us, you'll
Enter Input : see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,
Enter Input : you'll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What
Enter Input : are you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What's one to do with
Enter Input : such children?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,
Enter Input : rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried
Enter Input : to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,
Enter Input : that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like
Enter Input : an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a
Enter Input : boarding-school.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air," cried Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. "No, Rodion Romanovitch, that
Enter Input : dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,
Enter Input : Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing
Enter Input : in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my
Enter Input : name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!
Enter Input : But enough of them, now I'll provide for the children myself, I won't
Enter Input : bow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!" she pointed
Enter Input : to Sonia. "Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two
Enter Input : farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after
Enter Input : us, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing
Enter Input : at?" (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) "It's all because Kolya here
Enter Input : is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?
Enter Input : Tell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I've taught you, you know
Enter Input : some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well
Enter Input : brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren't
Enter Input : going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel
Enter Input : song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,
Enter Input : but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find
Enter Input : something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,
Enter Input : as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it
Enter Input : over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,
Enter Input : where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed
Enter Input : at once. Lida knows 'My Village' only, nothing but 'My Village,' and
Enter Input : everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,
Enter Input : have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you'd help your mother!
Enter Input : My memory's quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really
Enter Input : can't sing 'An Hussar.' Ah, let us sing in French, 'Cinq sous,' I have
Enter Input : taught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will
Enter Input : see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much
Enter Input : more touching.... You might sing 'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre,'
Enter Input : for that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the
Enter Input : aristocratic houses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_..."
Enter Input : she began singing. "But no, better sing 'Cinq sous.' Now, Kolya, your
Enter Input : hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other
Enter Input : way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : (Cough-cough-cough!) "Set your dress straight, Polenka, it's slipped
Enter Input : down on your shoulders," she observed, panting from coughing. "Now it's
Enter Input : particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may
Enter Input : see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice
Enter Input : should be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,
Enter Input : with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite
Enter Input : deformed by it.... Why, you're all crying again! What's the matter,
Enter Input : stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an
Enter Input : unbearable child!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Cinq sous, cinq sous.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A policeman again! What do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that
Enter Input : moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking
Enter Input : official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and
Enter Input : without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore
Enter Input : a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a
Enter Input : polite, even ceremonious, bow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I thank you, honoured sir," she began loftily. "The causes that have
Enter Input : induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and
Enter Input : honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).
Enter Input : You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of
Enter Input : aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating
Enter Input : grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. 'Your excellency,' I said,
Enter Input : 'protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,
Enter Input : and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his
Enter Input : only daughter.'... That policeman again! Protect me," she cried to the
Enter Input : official. "Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run
Enter Input : away from one of them. What do you want, fool?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's forbidden in the streets. You mustn't make a disturbance."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's you're making a disturbance. It's just the same as if I were
Enter Input : grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven't got one, and in
Enter Input : that way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, a license?" wailed Katerina Ivanovna. "I buried my husband
Enter Input : to-day. What need of a license?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself," began the official. "Come along;
Enter Input : I will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are
Enter Input : ill."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don't know," screamed Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna. "We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?
Enter Input : She is crying too! What's the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where
Enter Input : are you going?" she cried suddenly in alarm. "Oh, silly children! Kolya,
Enter Input : Lida, where are they off to?..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their
Enter Input : mother's mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off
Enter Input : at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
Enter Input : Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was
Enter Input : a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for
Enter Input : breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful
Enter Input : children!... Polenka! catch them.... It's for your sakes I..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She stumbled as she ran and fell down.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's cut herself, she's bleeding! Oh, dear!" cried Sonia, bending over
Enter Input : her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the
Enter Input : first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the
Enter Input : policeman who muttered, "Bother!" with a gesture of impatience, feeling
Enter Input : that the job was going to be a troublesome one.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pass on! Pass on!" he said to the crowd that pressed forward.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's dying," someone shouted.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's gone out of her mind," said another.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Lord have mercy upon us," said a woman, crossing herself. "Have they
Enter Input : caught the little girl and the boy? They're being brought back, the
Enter Input : elder one's got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had
Enter Input : not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood
Enter Input : that stained the pavement red was from her chest.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've seen that before," muttered the official to Raskolnikov and
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov; "that's consumption; the blood flows and chokes the
Enter Input : patient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...
Enter Input : nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What's to be done though?
Enter Input : She is dying."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This way, this way, to my room!" Sonia implored. "I live here!... See,
Enter Input : that house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste," she turned
Enter Input : from one to the other. "Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Thanks to the official's efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman
Enter Input : even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia's
Enter Input : room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still
Enter Input : flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were
Enter Input : followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed
Enter Input : to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who
Enter Input : were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the
Enter Input : Kapernaumovs' room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange
Enter Input : appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his
Enter Input : wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several
Enter Input : open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him
Enter Input : with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having
Enter Input : noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The
Enter Input : official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now
Enter Input : for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran
Enter Input : himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased
Enter Input : for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at
Enter Input : Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with
Enter Input : a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the
Enter Input : bed, supporting her on both sides.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are the children?" she said in a faint voice. "You've brought
Enter Input : them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,
Enter Input : looking about her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So that's how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She looked at her with a face of suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,
Enter Input : here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I've had
Enter Input : enough! The ball is over." (Cough!) "Lay me down, let me die in peace."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They laid her back on the pillow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, the priest? I don't want him. You haven't got a rouble to spare.
Enter Input : I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have
Enter Input : suffered.... And if He won't forgive me, I don't care!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,
Enter Input : turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,
Enter Input : but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and
Enter Input : difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I said to him, your excellency," she ejaculated, gasping after each
Enter Input : word. "That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,
Enter Input : make haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a
Enter Input : graceful child!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What next? That's the thing to sing.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr?_
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,
Enter Input : yes!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your
Enter Input : father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those
Enter Input : days! Oh that's the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I've
Enter Input : forgotten. Remind me! How was it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly
Enter Input : hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,
Enter Input : with a look of growing terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in
Enter Input : my breast!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your excellency!" she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and
Enter Input : a flood of tears, "protect the orphans! You have been their father's
Enter Input : guest... one may say aristocratic...." She started, regaining
Enter Input : consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once
Enter Input : recognised Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sonia, Sonia!" she articulated softly and caressingly, as though
Enter Input : surprised to find her there. "Sonia darling, are you here, too?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They lifted her up again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Enough! It's over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!"
Enter Input : she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the
Enter Input : pillow.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.
Enter Input : Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg
Enter Input : moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless
Enter Input : with her head pressed to the dead woman's wasted bosom. Polenka threw
Enter Input : herself at her mother's feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though
Enter Input : Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling
Enter Input : that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other's
Enter Input : little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened
Enter Input : their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy
Enter Input : dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And how did "the certificate of merit" come to be on the bed beside
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She is dead," he said.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you," said Svidrigaïlov,
Enter Input : coming up to them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know
Enter Input : it's a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I
Enter Input : will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,
Enter Input : and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming
Enter Input : of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I
Enter Input : will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn't she? So
Enter Input : tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is your motive for such benevolence?" asked Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah! you sceptical person!" laughed Svidrigaïlov. "I told you I had no
Enter Input : need of that money. Won't you admit that it's simply done from humanity?
Enter Input : She wasn't 'a louse,' you know" (he pointed to the corner where the
Enter Input : dead woman lay), "was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you'll
Enter Input : agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to
Enter Input : die? And if I didn't help them, Polenka would go the same way."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his
Enter Input : eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own
Enter Input : phrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How do you know?" he whispered, hardly able to breathe.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich's, the other side of the wall.
Enter Input : Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted
Enter Input : friend of mine. I am a neighbour."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. "I assure you
Enter Input : on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me
Enter Input : enormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,
Enter Input : here we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You'll
Enter Input : see that you can get on with me!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : PART VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had
Enter Input : fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there
Enter Input : was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his
Enter Input : mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with
Enter Input : intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been
Enter Input : mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date
Enter Input : of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his
Enter Input : recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what
Enter Input : other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained
Enter Input : events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At
Enter Input : times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes
Enter Input : to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,
Enter Input : of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous
Enter Input : terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes
Enter Input : seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape
Enter Input : from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential
Enter Input : facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome
Enter Input : to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the
Enter Input : neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable
Enter Input : ruin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be
Enter Input : permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov's
Enter Input : too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia's room at the moment of
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's death, the normal working of his mind seemed to
Enter Input : break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding
Enter Input : himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched
Enter Input : eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had
Enter Input : come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised
Enter Input : suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an
Enter Input : understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking
Enter Input : outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had
Enter Input : fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another
Enter Input : time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes
Enter Input : and could not at first understand how he had come there.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, he
Enter Input : had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia's lodging, where he
Enter Input : had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no
Enter Input : reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not
Enter Input : to speak of it for a time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna's body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was
Enter Input : busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At
Enter Input : their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
Enter Input : an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna's
Enter Input : children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting
Enter Input : hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
Enter Input : once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
Enter Input : on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place
Enter Input : orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something
Enter Input : too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, mentioning that "he would like to consult with him, that
Enter Input : there were things they must talk over...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,
Enter Input : dropping his voice, asked: "But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you
Enter Input : don't seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don't seem to
Enter Input : understand. Cheer up! We'll talk things over; I am only sorry, I've
Enter Input : so much to do of my own business and other people's. Ah, Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch," he added suddenly, "what all men need is fresh air, fresh
Enter Input : air... more than anything!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who
Enter Input : were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov's orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed
Enter Input : the priest into Sonia's room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,
Enter Input : slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the
Enter Input : thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive
Enter Input : and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem
Enter Input : service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and
Enter Input : disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the
Enter Input : coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it
Enter Input : were, timidly weeping.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "These last two days she hasn't said a word to me, she hasn't glanced at
Enter Input : me," Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;
Enter Input : the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, "Give rest, oh Lord...."
Enter Input : Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and
Enter Input : took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her
Enter Input : head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of
Enter Input : repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the
Enter Input : furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt
Enter Input : very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he
Enter Input : would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life
Enter Input : there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had
Enter Input : never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to
Enter Input : the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier
Enter Input : the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near
Enter Input : him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he
Enter Input : made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter
Enter Input : restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt
Enter Input : easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour
Enter Input : listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively
Enter Input : enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,
Enter Input : as though his conscience smote him. "Here I sit listening to singing,
Enter Input : is that what I ought to be doing?" he thought. Yet he felt at once
Enter Input : that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something
Enter Input : requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly
Enter Input : understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. "No, better the
Enter Input : struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some
Enter Input : challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!" he thought. He went out of
Enter Input : the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and
Enter Input : his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke
Enter Input : up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling
Enter Input : all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he
Enter Input : arrived. After some hours' sleep the fever left him, but he woke up
Enter Input : late, two o'clock in the afternoon.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna's funeral had been fixed for that
Enter Input : day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him
Enter Input : some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His
Enter Input : head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three
Enter Input : days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The door opened and Razumihin came in.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, he's eating, then he's not ill," said Razumihin. He took a chair
Enter Input : and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident
Enter Input : annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though
Enter Input : he had some special fixed determination.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen," he began resolutely. "As far as I am concerned, you may all go
Enter Input : to hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or
Enter Input : tail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions. I don't
Enter Input : want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say
Enter Input : I shouldn't stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come
Enter Input : to find out once for all whether it's a fact that you are mad? There is
Enter Input : a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit
Enter Input : I've been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,
Enter Input : repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior
Enter Input : to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them
Enter Input : as you have; so you must be mad."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "When did you see them last?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Just now. Haven't you seen them since then? What have you been doing
Enter Input : with yourself? Tell me, please. I've been to you three times already.
Enter Input : Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up
Enter Input : her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she
Enter Input : wouldn't hear a word. 'If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can
Enter Input : look after him like his mother?' she said. We all came here together, we
Enter Input : couldn't let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.
Enter Input : We came in, you weren't here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,
Enter Input : while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: 'If he's
Enter Input : gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it's
Enter Input : humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for
Enter Input : kindness.' She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.
Enter Input : 'I see,' she said, 'that he has time for _his girl_.' She means by _your
Enter Input : girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don't know. I
Enter Input : went at once to Sofya Semyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was going
Enter Input : on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and
Enter Input : Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I
Enter Input : apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that's all
Enter Input : nonsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that you
Enter Input : are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you'd not had
Enter Input : a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but
Enter Input : though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I'd
Enter Input : swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,
Enter Input : for there's some mystery, some secret about it, and I don't intend to
Enter Input : worry my brains over your secrets. So I've simply come to swear at you,"
Enter Input : he finished, getting up, "to relieve my mind. And I know what to do
Enter Input : now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you mean to do now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What business is it of yours what I mean to do?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are going in for a drinking bout."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How... how did you know?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, it's pretty plain."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin paused for a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You always have been a very rational person and you've never been mad,
Enter Input : never," he observed suddenly with warmth. "You're right: I shall drink.
Enter Input : Good-bye!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he moved to go out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it
Enter Input : was--about you, Razumihin."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?"
Enter Input : Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She did!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What did you say to her... I mean, about me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn't
Enter Input : tell her you love her, because she knows that herself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She knows that herself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, it's pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,
Enter Input : you would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your
Enter Input : keeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love
Enter Input : her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too
Enter Input : may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,
Enter Input : as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?
Enter Input : Of course, if it's all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find
Enter Input : out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense
Enter Input : and that you've made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a
Enter Input : capital fellow!..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was
Enter Input : a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to
Enter Input : time, don't worry about it. You'll know it all in time when it must be.
Enter Input : Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh
Enter Input : air, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant
Enter Input : by that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent
Enter Input : conclusion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's a political conspirator! He must be. And he's on the eve of some
Enter Input : desperate step, that's certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia
Enter Input : knows," he thought suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you," he said, weighing each
Enter Input : syllable, "and you're going to see a man who says we need more air, and
Enter Input : so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,"
Enter Input : he concluded to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What letter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too
Enter Input : much so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then
Enter Input : she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began
Enter Input : warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked
Enter Input : herself in."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She got a letter?" Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, and you didn't know? hm..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were both silent.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,
Enter Input : good-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off
Enter Input : too. I am not going to drink. There's no need now.... That's all stuff!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he
Enter Input : suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry's, that
Enter Input : old woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed
Enter Input : and given the proofs. It's one of those very workmen, the painter, only
Enter Input : fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all
Enter Input : that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs
Enter Input : while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on
Enter Input : purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the
Enter Input : young dog! One can hardly credit it; but it's his own explanation, he
Enter Input : has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he's simply
Enter Input : a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of
Enter Input : the lawyers--so there's nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course
Enter Input : people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn't keep
Enter Input : up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But
Enter Input : what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest
Enter Input : you so?" Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from
Enter Input : Porfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From Porfiry?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From Porfiry."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What... what did he say?" Raskolnikov asked in dismay.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his
Enter Input : fashion."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He explained it? Explained it himself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes; good-bye. I'll tell you all about it another time, but now
Enter Input : I'm busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another
Enter Input : time!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk
Enter Input : without wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I'm going. I'll come again
Enter Input : very soon."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's a political conspirator, there's not a doubt about it," Razumihin
Enter Input : decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. "And he's drawn his sister
Enter Input : in; that's quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna's character.
Enter Input : There are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of
Enter Input : her words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this
Enter Input : tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,
Enter Input : what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was
Enter Input : his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,
Enter Input : nasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And
Enter Input : how clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...
Enter Input : before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....
Enter Input : But what's the meaning now of that letter? There's something in that,
Enter Input : too, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,
Enter Input : and he suddenly broke into a run.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,
Enter Input : walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the
Enter Input : smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to
Enter Input : speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too
Enter Input : cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon
Enter Input : him at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry's he
Enter Input : had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay's
Enter Input : confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his
Enter Input : behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he
Enter Input : could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and
Enter Input : fundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed
Enter Input : in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his
Enter Input : mind!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but
Enter Input : somehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come
Enter Input : with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but
Enter Input : Porfiry was a different matter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it
Enter Input : _psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
Enter Input : Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that
Enter Input : Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay's
Enter Input : appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only
Enter Input : _one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled
Enter Input : passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind
Enter Input : rest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they
Enter Input : had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had
Enter Input : reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the
Enter Input : first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the
Enter Input : corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to
Enter Input : Porfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?
Enter Input : What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must
Enter Input : have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that
Enter Input : a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight
Enter Input : nor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It
Enter Input : was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,
Enter Input : at least. "I must settle Svidrigaïlov," he thought, "and as soon as
Enter Input : possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own
Enter Input : accord." And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his
Enter Input : weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it
Enter Input : later, if not now.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We shall see, we shall see," he repeated to himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry
Enter Input : himself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was
Enter Input : dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he
Enter Input : was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of
Enter Input : him. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
Enter Input : "Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached
Enter Input : so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been
Enter Input : listening at the door?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry explained,
Enter Input : laughing. "I've been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by
Enter Input : and thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won't
Enter Input : keep you long. Just let me have one cigarette."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down." Raskolnikov gave his visitor
Enter Input : a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have
Enter Input : marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man
Enter Input : will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,
Enter Input : yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him
Enter Input : without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a
Enter Input : cigarette.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Speak, speak," seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov's
Enter Input : heart. "Come, why don't you speak?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah these cigarettes!" Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having
Enter Input : lighted one. "They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I
Enter Input : can't give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and
Enter Input : a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to
Enter Input : Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He
Enter Input : positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: 'Tobacco's bad for
Enter Input : you,' he said, 'your lungs are affected.' But how am I to give it up?
Enter Input : What is there to take its place? I don't drink, that's the mischief,
Enter Input : he-he-he, that I don't. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,
Enter Input : everything is relative!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, he's playing his professional tricks again," Raskolnikov thought
Enter Input : with disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly
Enter Input : came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon
Enter Input : him then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn't
Enter Input : know?" Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. "I came into
Enter Input : this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought
Enter Input : I'd return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked
Enter Input : round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.
Enter Input : Don't you lock your door?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess
Enter Input : his state of mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!
Enter Input : I owe you an explanation and must give it to you," he continued with a
Enter Input : slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov's knee.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his
Enter Input : face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had
Enter Input : never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.
Enter Input : Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing
Enter Input : after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;
Enter Input : I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and
Enter Input : your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour
Enter Input : was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,
Enter Input : in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we
Enter Input : came to?... and it was quite indecorous."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is he up to, what does he take me for?" Raskolnikov asked himself
Enter Input : in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've decided openness is better between us," Porfiry Petrovitch went
Enter Input : on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to
Enter Input : disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.
Enter Input : "Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay
Enter Input : put a stop to it, or I don't know what we might not have come to. That
Enter Input : damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise
Enter Input : that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you
Enter Input : afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for
Enter Input : anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn't? What
Enter Input : shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely
Enter Input : sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).
Enter Input : An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,
Enter Input : Rodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for
Enter Input : a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan't lose what I want,
Enter Input : anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;
Enter Input : it's out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,
Enter Input : which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did
Enter Input : reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and
Enter Input : blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a
Enter Input : man lose all patience, though even then it's rare. I was capable of
Enter Input : realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact
Enter Input : to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not
Enter Input : merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get
Enter Input : something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising
Enter Input : results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,
Enter Input : on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that
Enter Input : time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what are you driving at now?" Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking
Enter Input : the question without thinking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is he talking about?" he wondered distractedly, "does he really
Enter Input : take me to be innocent?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What am I driving at? I've come to explain myself, I consider it my
Enter Input : duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,
Enter Input : the whole misunderstanding arose. I've caused you a great deal of
Enter Input : suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what
Enter Input : it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,
Enter Input : imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!
Enter Input : I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without
Enter Input : elements of magnanimity, though I don't agree with all your convictions.
Enter Input : I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above
Enter Input : all I don't want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt
Enter Input : attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a
Enter Input : right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you've no
Enter Input : reason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do
Enter Input : all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart
Enter Input : and conscience. I speak sincerely."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of
Enter Input : renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent
Enter Input : began to make him uneasy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail," Porfiry
Enter Input : Petrovitch went on. "Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with
Enter Input : there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to
Enter Input : me... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions
Enter Input : were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have
Enter Input : happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that
Enter Input : either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I
Enter Input : admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was
Enter Input : the first to pitch on you. The old woman's notes on the pledges and
Enter Input : the rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.
Enter Input : I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who
Enter Input : described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great
Enter Input : vividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my
Enter Input : dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a
Enter Input : hundred rabbits you can't make a horse, a hundred suspicions don't make
Enter Input : a proof, as the English proverb says, but that's only from the rational
Enter Input : point of view--you can't help being partial, for after all a lawyer
Enter Input : is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you
Enter Input : remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the
Enter Input : time, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,
Enter Input : you are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest
Enter Input : and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt
Enter Input : the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived
Enter Input : on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed
Enter Input : enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is
Enter Input : dangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary
Enter Input : amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of
Enter Input : youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your
Enter Input : article is absurd and fantastic, but there's a transparent sincerity,
Enter Input : a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It's a
Enter Input : gloomy article, but that's what's fine in it. I read your article and
Enter Input : put it aside, thinking as I did so 'that man won't go the common way.'
Enter Input : Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being
Enter Input : carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I
Enter Input : am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is
Enter Input : there in it? I reflected. There's nothing in it, that is really nothing
Enter Input : and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it's not at all the thing for
Enter Input : the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have
Enter Input : Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what
Enter Input : you like of it, but it's evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one
Enter Input : has to consider him, too, for it's a matter of life and death. Why am
Enter Input : I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my
Enter Input : malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure
Enter Input : you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn't come to search your room at the
Enter Input : time? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,
Enter Input : not officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was
Enter Input : searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I
Enter Input : thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and
Enter Input : quickly, too; if he's guilty, he's sure to come. Another man wouldn't,
Enter Input : but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the
Enter Input : subject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread
Enter Input : rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a
Enter Input : man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by
Enter Input : your anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant
Enter Input : 'I killed her.' It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if
Enter Input : he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought
Enter Input : at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over
Enter Input : and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology
Enter Input : can be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you
Enter Input : came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you
Enter Input : remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you
Enter Input : so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You
Enter Input : see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that
Enter Input : stone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere
Enter Input : in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and
Enter Input : afterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking
Enter Input : your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word
Enter Input : of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and
Enter Input : knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what
Enter Input : I was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if
Enter Input : you like, and it's more natural so, indeed. I couldn't help admitting
Enter Input : it was more natural. I was bothered! 'No, I'd better get hold of some
Enter Input : little fact' I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my
Enter Input : breath and was all in a tremor. 'Here is my little fact,' thought I, and
Enter Input : I didn't think it over, I simply wouldn't. I would have given a thousand
Enter Input : roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you
Enter Input : walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you
Enter Input : murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question
Enter Input : all the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your
Enter Input : bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on
Enter Input : you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to
Enter Input : have sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you
Enter Input : remember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a
Enter Input : thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn't believe
Enter Input : in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;
Enter Input : and how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making
Enter Input : very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised
Enter Input : at him myself, even then I didn't believe his story! You see what it is
Enter Input : to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay
Enter Input : got to do with it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had
Enter Input : yourself assured him of it...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in
Enter Input : indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through
Enter Input : him, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not
Enter Input : believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for
Enter Input : something more definite and conclusive.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mr. Razumihin!" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question
Enter Input : from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. "He-he-he! But I had to
Enter Input : put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is
Enter Input : not the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me
Enter Input : with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return
Enter Input : to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I
Enter Input : understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not
Enter Input : exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don't laugh
Enter Input : at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He
Enter Input : has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells
Enter Input : stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.
Enter Input : He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger
Enter Input : to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at
Enter Input : times, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,
Enter Input : without knowing it himself, for 'How can it be stealing, if one picks it
Enter Input : up?' And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There
Enter Input : have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his
Enter Input : village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all
Enter Input : this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what's more, he
Enter Input : wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at
Enter Input : night, read the old books, 'the true' ones, and read himself crazy.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :      [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the
Enter Input : wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I
Enter Input : learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see
Enter Input : him, and now this business came upon him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can
Enter Input : one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The
Enter Input : very word 'trial' frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall
Enter Input : see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in
Enter Input : prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,
Enter Input : made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of
Enter Input : the word 'suffering' among some of these people! It's not a question of
Enter Input : suffering for someone's benefit, but simply, 'one must suffer.' If they
Enter Input : suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time
Enter Input : there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison
Enter Input : always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself
Enter Input : crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he
Enter Input : seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him
Enter Input : no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side
Enter Input : on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to
Enter Input : a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So 'he took his
Enter Input : suffering.'
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something
Enter Input : of the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn't
Enter Input : know that I know. What, you don't admit that there are such fantastic
Enter Input : people among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun
Enter Input : influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he'll
Enter Input : come and tell me all himself. You think he'll hold out? Wait a bit,
Enter Input : he'll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to
Enter Input : come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am
Enter Input : studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me
Enter Input : very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence
Enter Input : and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,
Enter Input : knows nothing and doesn't even suspect that he doesn't know!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn't come in! This is a fantastic,
Enter Input : gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart
Enter Input : of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' when
Enter Input : comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a
Enter Input : heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,
Enter Input : but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over
Enter Input : a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the
Enter Input : crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for
Enter Input : a theory. He committed the murder and couldn't take the money, and what
Enter Input : he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn't enough for
Enter Input : him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and
Enter Input : rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to
Enter Input : recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
Enter Input : Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is
Enter Input : a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,
Enter Input : poses as injured innocence. No, that's not the work of a Nikolay, my
Enter Input : dear Rodion Romanovitch!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that
Enter Input : these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he
Enter Input : had been stabbed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then... who then... is the murderer?" he asked in a breathless voice,
Enter Input : unable to restrain himself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at
Enter Input : the question.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who is the murderer?" he repeated, as though unable to believe his
Enter Input : ears. "Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer," he added,
Enter Input : almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down
Enter Input : again without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Your lip is twitching just as it did before," Porfiry Petrovitch
Enter Input : observed almost sympathetically. "You've been misunderstanding me, I
Enter Input : think, Rodion Romanovitch," he added after a brief pause, "that's why
Enter Input : you are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal
Enter Input : openly with you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was not I murdered her," Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened
Enter Input : child caught in the act.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else," Porfiry
Enter Input : whispered sternly, with conviction.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten
Enter Input : minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers
Enter Input : through his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method
Enter Input : again. I wonder you don't get sick of it!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different
Enter Input : matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You
Enter Input : see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.
Enter Input : Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am
Enter Input : convinced without it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If so, what did you come for?" Raskolnikov asked irritably. "I ask you
Enter Input : the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don't you take
Enter Input : me to prison?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, that's your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the
Enter Input : first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How so? If you are convinced you ought...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, what if I am convinced? That's only my dream for the time. Why
Enter Input : should I put you in safety? You know that's it, since you ask me to do
Enter Input : it. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him
Enter Input : 'were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be
Enter Input : drunk, and you were drunk, too.' Well, what could I answer, especially
Enter Input : as your story is a more likely one than his? for there's nothing but
Enter Input : psychology to support his evidence--that's almost unseemly with his ugly
Enter Input : mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate
Enter Input : drunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several
Enter Input : times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the
Enter Input : second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from
Enter Input : that I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in
Enter Input : prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you
Enter Input : of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,
Enter Input : that it won't be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I've come to you
Enter Input : because..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, secondly?" Raskolnikov was listening breathless.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I
Enter Input : don't want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking
Enter Input : for you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I've come to
Enter Input : you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender
Enter Input : and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my
Enter Input : advantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part
Enter Input : or not?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov thought a minute.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but
Enter Input : psychology to go on, yet now you've gone on mathematics. Well, what if
Enter Input : you are mistaken yourself, now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even
Enter Input : then, Providence sent it me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What little fact?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven't
Enter Input : the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:
Enter Input : it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.
Enter Input : Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's not simply ridiculous, it's positively shameless. Why, even if I
Enter Input : were guilty, which I don't admit, what reason should I have to confess,
Enter Input : when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don't put too much faith in words, perhaps
Enter Input : prison will not be altogether a restful place. That's only theory and
Enter Input : my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am
Enter Input : hiding something from you? I can't lay bare everything, he-he! And how
Enter Input : can you ask what advantage? Don't you know how it would lessen your
Enter Input : sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken
Enter Input : the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I
Enter Input : swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall
Enter Input : come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these
Enter Input : psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime
Enter Input : will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it
Enter Input : was an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep
Enter Input : my word."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink
Enter Input : dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his
Enter Input : smile was sad and gentle.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No!" he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances
Enter Input : with Porfiry, "it's not worth it, I don't care about lessening the
Enter Input : sentence!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's just what I was afraid of!" Porfiry cried warmly and, as it
Enter Input : seemed, involuntarily. "That's just what I feared, that you wouldn't
Enter Input : care about the mitigation of sentence."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, don't disdain life!" Porfiry went on. "You have a great deal of
Enter Input : it still before you. How can you say you don't want a mitigation of
Enter Input : sentence? You are an impatient fellow!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A great deal of what lies before me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek
Enter Input : and ye shall find. This may be God's means for bringing you to Him. And
Enter Input : it's not for ever, the bondage...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The time will be shortened," laughed Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you
Enter Input : are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway
Enter Input : _you_ shouldn't be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ach, hang it!" Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as
Enter Input : though he did not want to speak aloud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in
Enter Input : evident despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hang it, if you like! You've lost faith and you think that I am
Enter Input : grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do
Enter Input : you understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke
Enter Input : down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something
Enter Input : base, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!
Enter Input : At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the
Enter Input : furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one
Enter Input : of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts
Enter Input : their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and
Enter Input : you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,
Enter Input : is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.
Enter Input : I know you don't believe in it--but don't be over-wise; fling yourself
Enter Input : straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid--the flood
Enter Input : will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What
Enter Input : bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before
Enter Input : you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared
Enter Input : beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use
Enter Input : some time. That's why I speak. It's as well that you only killed the
Enter Input : old woman. If you'd invented another theory you might perhaps have
Enter Input : done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,
Enter Input : perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.
Enter Input : But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great
Enter Input : expiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since
Enter Input : you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice
Enter Input : in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don't
Enter Input : believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it
Enter Input : down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov positively started.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic
Enter Input : calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that's all. A man
Enter Input : perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day
Enter Input : is over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.
Enter Input : Though, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come
Enter Input : to nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another
Enter Input : class of men? It's not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of
Enter Input : it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It's not time, but
Enter Input : yourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The
Enter Input : sun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being
Enter Input : such a Schiller? I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get round
Enter Input : you by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you'd better not
Enter Input : believe my word, perhaps you'd better never believe it altogether--I'm
Enter Input : made that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,
Enter Input : I think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "When do you mean to arrest me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my
Enter Input : dear fellow, and pray to God. It's more in your interest, believe me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And what if I run away?" asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, you won't run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable
Enter Input : dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man's thought, for
Enter Input : you've only to show him the end of your little finger and he'll be ready
Enter Input : to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you've ceased to
Enter Input : believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what
Enter Input : would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and
Enter Input : what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an
Enter Input : atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If
Enter Input : you ran away, you'd come back to yourself. _You can't get on without
Enter Input : us._ And if I put you in prison--say you've been there a month, or two,
Enter Input : or three--remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps to
Enter Input : your own surprise. You won't know an hour beforehand that you are coming
Enter Input : with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, 'to take your
Enter Input : suffering.' You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it of
Enter Input : yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never
Enter Input : mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don't laugh at it,
Enter Input : there's an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right. No, you won't run away,
Enter Input : Rodion Romanovitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don't
Enter Input : have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He, too, took his cap.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Porfiry Petrovitch, please don't take up the notion that I have
Enter Input : confessed to you to-day," Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.
Enter Input : "You're a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.
Enter Input : But I have admitted nothing, remember that!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I know that, I'll remember. Look at him, he's trembling! Don't
Enter Input : be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you
Enter Input : won't be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request
Enter Input : to make of you," he added, dropping his voice. "It's an awkward one, but
Enter Input : important. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don't believe
Enter Input : in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken
Enter Input : during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to
Enter Input : the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands
Enter Input : on yourself--(it's an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for
Enter Input : it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the
Enter Input : stone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and
Enter Input : sound decisions to you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The
Enter Input : latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he
Enter Input : calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he
Enter Input : too went hurriedly out of the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER III
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He hurried to Svidrigaïlov's. What he had to hope from that man he
Enter Input : did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once
Enter Input : recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been
Enter Input : to Porfiry's?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He
Enter Input : pondered again and again, went over Porfiry's visit; no, he hadn't been,
Enter Input : of course he hadn't.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he
Enter Input : fancied he couldn't. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,
Enter Input : he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all
Enter Input : worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to
Enter Input : say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague
Enter Input : anxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety
Enter Input : tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.
Enter Input : Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was
Enter Input : working better that morning than it had done of late.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with
Enter Input : these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to
Enter Input : manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry's? Was it worth
Enter Input : while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone
Enter Input : like Svidrigaïlov?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Oh, how sick he was of it all!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting
Enter Input : something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will
Enter Input : catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
Enter Input : Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : but some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented
Enter Input : himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg
Enter Input : her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as
Enter Input : an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment
Enter Input : especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be
Enter Input : better to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that
Enter Input : he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not
Enter Input : be of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently
Enter Input : depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such
Enter Input : stories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina
Enter Input : Ivanovna's children, but who could tell with what motive and what it
Enter Input : meant? The man always had some design, some project.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late
Enter Input : about Raskolnikov's mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so
Enter Input : painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes
Enter Input : thought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had
Enter Input : found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them
Enter Input : still? Wasn't it practically certain that he had? And what if, having
Enter Input : learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it
Enter Input : as a weapon against Dounia?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never
Enter Input : presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would
Enter Input : transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to
Enter Input : confess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps
Enter Input : to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning
Enter Input : Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in
Enter Input : Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It's true Razumihin was there to protect
Enter Input : her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty
Enter Input : to tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided
Enter Input : finally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little
Enter Input : consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but
Enter Input : if Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against
Enter Input : Dounia--then...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month
Enter Input : that he could only decide such questions in one way; "then I shall kill
Enter Input : him," he thought in cold despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of
Enter Input : the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he
Enter Input : was going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from
Enter Input : the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of
Enter Input : the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide
Enter Input : open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were
Enter Input : full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and
Enter Input : violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.
Enter Input : He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,
Enter Input : when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting
Enter Input : at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov
Enter Input : at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking
Enter Input : absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.
Enter Input : His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on
Enter Input : the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his
Enter Input : chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen
Enter Input : him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the
Enter Input : same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room. A
Enter Input : sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov's face and grew broader and
Enter Input : broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!" he shouted from the
Enter Input : window.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny
Enter Input : back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers
Enter Input : of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the
Enter Input : desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls
Enter Input : could be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood
Enter Input : an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found
Enter Input : also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl
Enter Input : of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with
Enter Input : ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some
Enter Input : servants' hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of
Enter Input : the organ.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Come, that's enough," Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov's
Enter Input : entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.
Enter Input : She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful
Enter Input : expression in her face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hey, Philip, a glass!" shouted Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't drink anything," said Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you like, I didn't mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don't want
Enter Input : anything more to-day, you can go." He poured her out a full glass, and
Enter Input : laid down a yellow note.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,
Enter Input : in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov's hand, which he
Enter Input : allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed
Enter Input : after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him
Enter Input : was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,
Enter Input : was by now an old friend and very obsequious.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at
Enter Input : home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was
Enter Input : dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was going to see you and looking for you," Raskolnikov began, "but
Enter Input : I don't know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect
Enter Input : just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay
Enter Input : Market. And this isn't the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.
Enter Input : It is strange!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why don't you say at once 'it's a miracle'?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because it may be only chance."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, that's the way with all you folk," laughed Svidrigaïlov. "You won't
Enter Input : admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say
Enter Input : that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about
Enter Input : having an opinion of their own, you can't fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I
Enter Input : don't mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to
Enter Input : have it. That's how it was you attracted my curiosity."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing else?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, that's enough, you know," Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,
Enter Input : but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having
Enter Input : what you call an opinion of my own," observed Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And
Enter Input : apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep
Enter Input : for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there
Enter Input : is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,
Enter Input : told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you
Enter Input : remember?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't remember," answered Raskolnikov with surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped
Enter Input : mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet
Enter Input : precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of
Enter Input : it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give
Enter Input : yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I'm
Enter Input : convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves
Enter Input : as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific
Enter Input : men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable
Enter Input : investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places
Enter Input : where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul
Enter Input : of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.
Enter Input : And it's the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must
Enter Input : be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there
Enter Input : now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out
Enter Input : of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it
Enter Input : sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see
Enter Input : nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and
Enter Input : talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at
Enter Input : last stand still in the middle of the road. That's not at all the thing.
Enter Input : Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good.
Enter Input : It's nothing really to do with me and I can't cure you, but, of course,
Enter Input : you understand me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Do you know that I am being followed?" asked Raskolnikov, looking
Enter Input : inquisitively at him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I know nothing about it," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, then, let us leave me alone," Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very good, let us leave you alone."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me
Enter Input : twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just
Enter Input : now when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and
Enter Input : pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your
Enter Input : doorway? I saw it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And I may have had my reasons, though you don't know them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the
Enter Input : fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a
Enter Input : full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It
Enter Input : was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,
Enter Input : with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow
Enter Input : too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was
Enter Input : something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so
Enter Input : wonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light
Enter Input : summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge
Enter Input : ring with a precious stone in it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?" said Raskolnikov
Enter Input : suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. "Even
Enter Input : though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,
Enter Input : I don't want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I
Enter Input : don't prize myself as you probably think I do. I've come to tell you at
Enter Input : once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister
Enter Input : and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has
Enter Input : been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.
Enter Input : You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the
Enter Input : second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all
Enter Input : this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,
Enter Input : for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why in such haste?" asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Everyone has his plans," Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question
Enter Input : you refuse to answer," Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. "You
Enter Input : keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with
Enter Input : suspicion. Of course it's perfectly natural in your position. But
Enter Input : though I should like to be friends with you, I shan't trouble myself
Enter Input : to convince you of the contrary. The game isn't worth the candle and I
Enter Input : wasn't intending to talk to you about anything special."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the
Enter Input : fantastic nature of your position--that's what it was! Besides you are
Enter Input : the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person
Enter Input : I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I
Enter Input : gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn't that enough?
Enter Input : Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and
Enter Input : is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me
Enter Input : not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something
Enter Input : new. Isn't that so? Isn't that so?" persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly
Enter Input : smile. "Well, can't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the
Enter Input : train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my
Enter Input : making some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What profit could you make?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all
Enter Input : my time and it's my enjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment,
Enter Input : but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only
Enter Input : I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a
Enter Input : terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you dined, by the way? I've had something and want nothing more.
Enter Input : I don't drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch
Enter Input : anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even
Enter Input : that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind
Enter Input : myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a
Enter Input : peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a
Enter Input : schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe," he
Enter Input : pulled out his watch, "I can spend an hour with you. It's half-past
Enter Input : four now. If only I'd been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry
Enter Input : officer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,
Enter Input : and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me
Enter Input : something new."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what are you, and why have you come here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the
Enter Input : cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are a gambler, I believe?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You have been a card-sharper then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I've been a card-sharper too."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Didn't you get thrashed sometimes?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It did happen. Why?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been
Enter Input : lively."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I won't contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I
Enter Input : confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite so," Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. "What of it? You
Enter Input : seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Vice! Oh, that's what you are after! But I'll answer you in order,
Enter Input : first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,
Enter Input : what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I
Enter Input : have a passion for them? It's an occupation, anyway."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "So you hope for nothing here but vice?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway
Enter Input : I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something
Enter Input : permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,
Enter Input : something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever
Enter Input : setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even
Enter Input : with years. You'll agree it's an occupation of a sort."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a dangerous one."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, that's what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like
Enter Input : everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must
Enter Input : exceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way
Enter Input : or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate
Enter Input : and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn't
Enter Input : this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent
Enter Input : man ought to put up with being bored, but yet..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And could you shoot yourself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, come!" Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. "Please don't speak of
Enter Input : it," he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown
Enter Input : in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. "I admit it's
Enter Input : an unpardonable weakness, but I can't help it. I am afraid of death and
Enter Input : I dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent
Enter Input : a mystic?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting
Enter Input : you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, don't talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound
Enter Input : them!" he cried with an air of irritation. "Let's rather talk of that...
Enter Input : though... H'm! I have not much time, and can't stay long with you,
Enter Input : it's a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's your engagement, a woman?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that's not what I want to talk
Enter Input : of."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn't
Enter Input : that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just
Enter Input : now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.
Enter Input : You preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an
Enter Input : idealist! Of course that's all as it should be and it would be
Enter Input : surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,
Enter Input : what a pity I have no time, for you're a most interesting type! And,
Enter Input : by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But what a braggart you are," Raskolnikov said with some disgust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my word, I am not," answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. "However, I
Enter Input : won't dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no
Enter Input : one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when
Enter Input : I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly
Enter Input : interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I've drunk that
Enter Input : half-glass of champagne and it's gone to my head a little. And besides,
Enter Input : there's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that
Enter Input : I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?" he asked in alarm.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,
Enter Input : as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!" Svidrigaïlov begged. "Let them bring
Enter Input : you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won't talk nonsense, about
Enter Input : myself, I mean. I'll tell you something. If you like I'll tell you how a
Enter Input : woman tried 'to save' me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to
Enter Input : your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell
Enter Input : you? It will help to spend the time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Tell me, but I trust that you..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, don't be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER IV
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself," began Svidrigaïlov, "that
Enter Input : I was in the debtors' prison here, for an immense sum, and had not
Enter Input : any expectation of being able to pay it. There's no need to go into
Enter Input : particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a
Enter Input : point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,
Enter Input : and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe
Enter Input : that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and
Enter Input : reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which
Enter Input : she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than
Enter Input : I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There
Enter Input : was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to
Enter Input : tell her straight out that I couldn't be absolutely faithful to her.
Enter Input : This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have
Enter Input : liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to
Enter Input : deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous
Enter Input : woman, you know, that's the first consideration. After many tears an
Enter Input : unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never
Enter Input : leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I
Enter Input : would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would
Enter Input : never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her
Enter Input : secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of
Enter Input : our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by
Enter Input : a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On
Enter Input : this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a
Enter Input : sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute
Enter Input : profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous
Enter Input : woman are two very different things, and that's where the trouble
Enter Input : came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain
Enter Input : preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people
Enter Input : about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
Enter Input : in anyone's. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was
Enter Input : ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very
Enter Input : ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the
Enter Input : innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that's enough, I
Enter Input : think, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife
Enter Input : of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue
Enter Input : and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to
Enter Input : attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were
Enter Input : times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn't
Enter Input : put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a
Enter Input : beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that
Enter Input : Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell
Enter Input : in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little
Enter Input : wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance
Enter Input : and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you
Enter Input : believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first
Enter Input : for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception
Enter Input : of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don't know
Enter Input : what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of
Enter Input : telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually
Enter Input : complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful
Enter Input : new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were
Enter Input : current about me.... I don't mind betting that you too have heard
Enter Input : something of the sort already?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is
Enter Input : that true?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't refer to those vulgar tales, I beg," said Svidrigaïlov with
Enter Input : disgust and annoyance. "If you insist on wanting to know about all that
Enter Input : idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you
Enter Input : treated badly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I beg you to drop the subject," Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with
Enter Input : obvious impatience.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
Enter Input : you told me about it yourself." Raskolnikov felt more and more
Enter Input : irritated.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught
Enter Input : a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained
Enter Input : himself and answered very civilly:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall
Enter Input : feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon
Enter Input : my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with
Enter Input : some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having
Enter Input : repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip
Enter Input : about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any
Enter Input : case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna's natural
Enter Input : aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she
Enter Input : did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a
Enter Input : girl's heart is moved to _pity_, it's more dangerous than anything. She
Enter Input : is bound to want to 'save him,' to bring him to his senses, and lift
Enter Input : him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and
Enter Input : usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once
Enter Input : that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.
Enter Input : I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There's no need. As you
Enter Input : know, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)
Enter Input : Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn't
Enter Input : your sister's fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as
Enter Input : the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia
Enter Input : Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure
Enter Input : martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot
Enter Input : pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or
Enter Input : fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and
Enter Input : would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and
Enter Input : visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and
Enter Input : if she can't get her torture, she'll throw herself out of a window. I've
Enter Input : heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he's said to be a sensible fellow;
Enter Input : his surname suggests it, indeed. He's probably a divinity student. Well,
Enter Input : he'd better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am
Enter Input : proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one
Enter Input : is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn't see clearly. Hang it
Enter Input : all, why is she so handsome? It's not my fault. In fact, it began on
Enter Input : my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is
Enter Input : awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you
Enter Input : this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in
Enter Input : spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There
Enter Input : happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed
Enter Input : wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another
Enter Input : village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,
Enter Input : wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
Enter Input : One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in
Enter Input : the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha
Enter Input : alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,
Enter Input : was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,
Enter Input : embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,
Enter Input : mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even
Enter Input : tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for
Enter Input : propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on
Enter Input : my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally
Enter Input : resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the
Enter Input : female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It's the well-known
Enter Input : resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the
Enter Input : truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there's the hundredth part
Enter Input : of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that
Enter Input : leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it
Enter Input : is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be
Enter Input : a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the
Enter Input : flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That's so for all
Enter Input : stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be
Enter Input : seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once
Enter Input : seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her
Enter Input : principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really
Enter Input : had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being
Enter Input : utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her
Enter Input : shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of
Enter Input : the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having
Enter Input : snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that
Enter Input : I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
Enter Input : I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my
Enter Input : treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In
Enter Input : fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was
Enter Input : innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and
Enter Input : had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I
Enter Input : explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was
Enter Input : just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of
Enter Input : flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property
Enter Input : settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine
Enter Input : now and talking too much.) I hope you won't be angry if I mention now
Enter Input : that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.
Enter Input : But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had
Enter Input : several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by
Enter Input : the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a
Enter Input : light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and
Enter Input : more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,
Enter Input : but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the
Enter Input : coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha
Enter Input : came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a
Enter Input : tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your
Enter Input : sister's eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this
Enter Input : moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.
Enter Input : I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of
Enter Input : her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think
Enter Input : that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could
Enter Input : be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,
Enter Input : but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what
Enter Input : a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake
Enter Input : anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya
Enter Input : Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that's not the word...
Enter Input : but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by
Enter Input : her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you
Enter Input : are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty
Enter Input : thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with
Enter Input : me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,
Enter Input : rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time
Enter Input : that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat
Enter Input : and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in
Enter Input : the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I
Enter Input : was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly
Enter Input : attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would
Enter Input : really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn't it?
Enter Input : Wouldn't it? I notice that you've begun to be very attentive... you
Enter Input : interesting young man...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne
Enter Input : that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he
Enter Input : resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious
Enter Input : of Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have
Enter Input : come to Petersburg with designs on my sister," he said directly to
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, nonsense," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. "Why, I
Enter Input : told you... besides your sister can't endure me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I am certain that she can't, but that's not the point."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you so sure that she can't?" Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and
Enter Input : smiled mockingly. "You are right, she doesn't love me, but you can
Enter Input : never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and
Enter Input : mistress. There's always a little corner which remains a secret to
Enter Input : the world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From some words you've dropped, I notice that you still have
Enter Input : designs--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out
Enter Input : promptly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, have I dropped words like that?" Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve
Enter Input : dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his
Enter Input : designs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What
Enter Input : are you so afraid of now?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher
Enter Input : ami_. But what nonsense.... I've drunk too much though, I see that. I
Enter Input : was almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of
Enter Input : the window. Philip brought the water.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's all nonsense!" said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it
Enter Input : to his head. "But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your
Enter Input : suspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You told me so before."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Did I? I've forgotten. But I couldn't have told you so for certain for
Enter Input : I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really
Enter Input : have a betrothed and it's a settled thing, and if it weren't that I have
Enter Input : business that can't be put off, I would have taken you to see them
Enter Input : at once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten
Enter Input : minutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it's an
Enter Input : interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?
Enter Input : Going again?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I'm not going away now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not at all? We shall see. I'll take you there, I'll show you my
Enter Input : betrothed, only not now. For you'll soon have to be off. You have to go
Enter Input : to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the
Enter Input : woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you're thinking, that she's
Enter Input : the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are
Enter Input : you listening? She arranged it all for me. You're bored, she said,
Enter Input : you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,
Enter Input : depressed person. Do you think I'm light-hearted? No, I'm gloomy. I do
Enter Input : no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a
Enter Input : time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has
Enter Input : got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and
Enter Input : depart, and she'll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our
Enter Input : class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down
Enter Input : retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three
Enter Input : years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible
Enter Input : woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn't help;
Enter Input : there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn't visit them. And
Enter Input : they've two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children
Enter Input : were not enough, and they've taken from school their youngest daughter,
Enter Input : a girl who'll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be
Enter Input : married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present
Enter Input : myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,
Enter Input : with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks
Enter Input : of that? But it's fascinating, isn't it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You
Enter Input : should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying
Enter Input : to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,
Enter Input : still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had
Enter Input : been told, no doubt. I don't know how you feel about female faces, but
Enter Input : to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears
Enter Input : of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little
Enter Input : picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb's, full little rosy
Enter Input : lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was
Enter Input : in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is
Enter Input : the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on
Enter Input : my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset
Enter Input : and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that
Enter Input : this is her husband and that this must be so. It's simply delicious! The
Enter Input : present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you
Enter Input : have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I've talked to her
Enter Input : twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that
Enter Input : positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael's Madonna. You know,
Enter Input : the Sistine Madonna's face has something fantastic in it, the face
Enter Input : of mournful religious ecstasy. Haven't you noticed it? Well, she's
Enter Input : something in that line. The day after we'd been betrothed, I bought her
Enter Input : presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and
Enter Input : another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all
Enter Input : sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna's face glowed. I sat her
Enter Input : on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she
Enter Input : flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn't want to show it.
Enter Input : We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first
Enter Input : time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and
Enter Input : vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make
Enter Input : me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would
Enter Input : sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is
Enter Input : my _respect_, and that she wants 'nothing, nothing more from me, no
Enter Input : presents.' You'll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an
Enter Input : angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush
Enter Input : of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is
Enter Input : rather fascinating! Isn't it fascinating? It's worth paying for, isn't
Enter Input : it? Well... listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites
Enter Input : your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who
Enter Input : knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about
Enter Input : virtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...
Enter Input : though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am always fond of children, very fond of them," laughed Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : "I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I
Enter Input : visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You
Enter Input : probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my
Enter Input : old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when
Enter Input : I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought
Enter Input : of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great
Enter Input : deal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young
Enter Input : people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams
Enter Input : and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are
Enter Input : amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From
Enter Input : the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be
Enter Input : in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and
Enter Input : there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you
Enter Input : have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely
Enter Input : dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one
Enter Input : _vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can't
Enter Input : fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at
Enter Input : last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began
Enter Input : whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I
Enter Input : like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,
Enter Input : 'Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn't bring children!' Well,
Enter Input : it's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or
Enter Input : not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by
Enter Input : saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and
Enter Input : that they couldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,
Enter Input : gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them
Enter Input : home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were
Enter Input : lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the
Enter Input : country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my
Enter Input : acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their
Enter Input : own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my
Enter Input : services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon
Enter Input : by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to
Enter Input : assist in the young girl's education in French and dancing. My offer was
Enter Input : accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If
Enter Input : you like, we'll go and see them, only not just now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual
Enter Input : man!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_
Enter Input : But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure
Enter Input : of hearing your outcries!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself," muttered Raskolnikov
Enter Input : angrily.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,
Enter Input : and began getting up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_," he said. "It's been a pleasure."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I should rather think it must be a pleasure!" cried Raskolnikov,
Enter Input : getting up. "No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to
Enter Input : describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in
Enter Input : his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as
Enter Input : me.... It's stimulating!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, if you come to that," Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising
Enter Input : Raskolnikov with some surprise, "if you come to that, you are a thorough
Enter Input : cynic yourself. You've plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand
Enter Input : a great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely
Enter Input : regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan't lose sight of
Enter Input : you.... Only wait a bit."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after
Enter Input : him. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him
Enter Input : for a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied
Enter Input : with something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited
Enter Input : and uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had
Enter Input : changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering
Enter Input : every moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He
Enter Input : became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They came out on to the pavement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.
Enter Input : Only _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER V
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked after him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What's this?" cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, "I thought I said..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their
Enter Input : strength.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "From all your half tipsy stories," Raskolnikov observed harshly, "I am
Enter Input : _positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but
Enter Input : are pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister
Enter Input : received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still
Enter Input : all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that
Enter Input : means nothing. I should like to make certain myself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
Enter Input : wished to make certain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Upon my word! I'll call the police!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Call away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov's
Enter Input : face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not
Enter Input : frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,
Enter Input : though I am devoured by curiosity. It's a fantastic affair. I've put it
Enter Input : off till another time, but you're enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let
Enter Input : us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,
Enter Input : to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to
Enter Input : spend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to
Enter Input : say I'm sorry not to have been at the funeral."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken
Enter Input : the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some
Enter Input : orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by
Enter Input : depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of
Enter Input : Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her
Enter Input : too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.
Enter Input : It produced an indescribable effect on her. That's why Sofya Semyonovna
Enter Input : has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is
Enter Input : staying for the time."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No matter, I'll come all the same."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come with you; here we are
Enter Input : at home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion
Enter Input : just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled
Enter Input : you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I
Enter Input : don't mind betting it's that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And to listen at doors!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, that's it, is it?" laughed Svidrigaïlov. "Yes, I should have been
Enter Input : surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!
Enter Input : Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and
Enter Input : were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps
Enter Input : I am quite behind the times and can't understand. For goodness' sake,
Enter Input : explain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You couldn't have heard anything. You're making it all up!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But I'm not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I'm
Enter Input : talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in
Enter Input : you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at
Enter Input : doors. If that's how you feel, go and inform the police that you had
Enter Input : this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are
Enter Input : convinced that one mustn't listen at doors, but one may murder old women
Enter Input : at one's pleasure, you'd better be off to America and make haste. Run,
Enter Input : young man! There may still be time. I'm speaking sincerely. Haven't you
Enter Input : the money? I'll give you the fare."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I'm not thinking of that at all," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand (but don't put yourself out, don't discuss it if you don't
Enter Input : want to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,
Enter Input : aren't they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are
Enter Input : nothing to you now, ha-ha! You'll say you are still a man and a citizen.
Enter Input : If so you ought not to have got into this coil. It's no use taking up a
Enter Input : job you are not fit for. Well, you'd better shoot yourself, or don't you
Enter Input : want to?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You
Enter Input : see, that's the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.
Enter Input : Don't you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here
Enter Input : is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she
Enter Input : gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won't be till late in
Enter Input : the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see
Enter Input : me, didn't you? Here we are. Madame Resslich's not at home. She is a
Enter Input : woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might
Enter Input : have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,
Enter Input : see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot
Enter Input : I've got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I
Enter Input : mustn't waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,
Enter Input : and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I'm going to
Enter Input : the Islands. Would you like a lift? I'll take this carriage. Ah, you
Enter Input : refuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on
Enter Input : to rain. Never mind, we'll put down the hood...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his
Enter Input : suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a
Enter Input : word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only
Enter Input : turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a
Enter Input : hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he
Enter Input : had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him
Enter Input : away from Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that
Enter Input : coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!" he cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
Enter Input : something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a
Enter Input : mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced
Enter Input : that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome
Enter Input : and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as
Enter Input : usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and
Enter Input : began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing
Enter Input : her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was
Enter Input : struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call
Enter Input : to him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the
Enter Input : direction of the Hay Market.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the
Enter Input : bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had
Enter Input : been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not
Enter Input : to speak to her brother, but to come to him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let us make haste away," Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, "I don't want
Enter Input : Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I've been
Enter Input : sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and
Enter Input : I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of
Enter Input : my letter to you and suspects something. It wasn't you who told him, of
Enter Input : course, but if not you, who then?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, we've turned the corner now," Dounia interrupted, "and my brother
Enter Input : won't see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
Enter Input : Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In the first place, I can't say it in the street; secondly, you must
Enter Input : hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....
Enter Input : Oh well, if you won't agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give
Enter Input : any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that
Enter Input : a very curious secret of your beloved brother's is entirely in my
Enter Input : keeping."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with
Enter Input : searching eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you afraid of?" he observed quietly. "The town is not the
Enter Input : country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she
Enter Input : is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother
Enter Input : to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I
Enter Input : don't want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken
Enter Input : to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like
Enter Input : this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That's the porter
Enter Input : of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he's bowing; he sees I'm
Enter Input : coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you
Enter Input : will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse
Enter Input : my putting things so coarsely. I haven't a flat to myself; Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna's room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The
Enter Input : whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?
Enter Input : Am I really so terrible?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in
Enter Input : no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
Enter Input : He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not
Enter Input : notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that
Enter Input : she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to
Enter Input : her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the
Enter Input : least afraid of you. Lead the way," she said with apparent composure,
Enter Input : but her face was very pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia's room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How
Enter Input : unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she's gone out, it
Enter Input : can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....
Enter Input : I've been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna
Enter Input : does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if
Enter Input : you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,
Enter Input : my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you
Enter Input : my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two
Enter Input : perfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look
Enter Input : into them with some attention."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was
Enter Input : looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the
Enter Input : furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,
Enter Input : for instance, that Svidrigaïlov's flat was exactly between two sets of
Enter Input : almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly
Enter Input : from the passage, but through the landlady's two almost empty rooms.
Enter Input : Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia
Enter Input : the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not
Enter Input : knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to
Enter Input : explain.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it's locked.
Enter Input : By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it
Enter Input : from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of
Enter Input : the door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she sat there talking to Rodion
Enter Input : Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for
Enter Input : two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what
Enter Input : do you think?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You listened?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can't sit down here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her
Enter Input : a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven
Enter Input : feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which
Enter Input : had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked
Enter Input : about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently
Enter Input : did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov's lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask
Enter Input : whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from
Enter Input : asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably
Enter Input : greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here is your letter," she said, laying it on the table. "Can it be true
Enter Input : what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.
Enter Input : You hint at it too clearly; you daren't deny it now. I must tell you
Enter Input : that I'd heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don't believe a
Enter Input : word of it. It's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story
Enter Input : and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to
Enter Input : prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don't believe you! I don't
Enter Input : believe you!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour
Enter Input : rushed to her face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "If you didn't believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?
Enter Input : Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Don't torment me. Speak, speak!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought
Enter Input : you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not
Enter Input : with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It's spirited of
Enter Input : you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything
Enter Input : is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You've
Enter Input : just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Surely that's not the only thing you are building on?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive
Enter Input : evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I've shown you where they sat. He made
Enter Input : a full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a
Enter Input : pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister
Enter Input : too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he
Enter Input : was murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with
Enter Input : him. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and
Enter Input : various things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,
Enter Input : the only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word
Enter Input : or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don't
Enter Input : be anxious, she won't betray him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It cannot be," muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.
Enter Input : "It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....
Enter Input : It's a lie, a lie!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It's true
Enter Input : that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid
Enter Input : them under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared
Enter Input : not make use of them."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?" cried Dounia,
Enter Input : and she jumped up from the chair. "Why, you know him, and you've seen
Enter Input : him, can he be a thief?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her
Enter Input : fear.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I've
Enter Input : heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he
Enter Input : thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have
Enter Input : believed it myself if I'd been told of it as you have, but I believe my
Enter Input : own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but
Enter Input : she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at
Enter Input : last."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What... were the causes?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here's... how shall I tell
Enter Input : you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider
Enter Input : that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a
Enter Input : solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It's galling too, of
Enter Input : course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if
Enter Input : he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his
Enter Input : whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three
Enter Input : thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging
Enter Input : in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social
Enter Input : position and his sister's and mother's position too. Above all, vanity,
Enter Input : pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities
Enter Input : too.... I am not blaming him, please don't think it; besides, it's not
Enter Input : my business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a
Enter Input : sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,
Enter Input : that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their
Enter Input : superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that
Enter Input : is. It's all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleon
Enter Input : attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a
Enter Input : great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have
Enter Input : overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied
Enter Input : that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He
Enter Input : has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he
Enter Input : could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,
Enter Input : and so he is not a man of genius. And that's humiliating for a young man
Enter Input : of any pride, in our day especially...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was
Enter Input : ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to
Enter Input : the fantastic, the chaotic. But it's a misfortune to be broad without
Enter Input : a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on
Enter Input : this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,
Enter Input : you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking
Enter Input : at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There
Enter Input : are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for
Enter Input : himself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the
Enter Input : most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost
Enter Input : ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I
Enter Input : never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But
Enter Input : we've talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to
Enter Input : interest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is
Enter Input : permitted. Razumihin brought it to me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mr. Razumihin? Your brother's article? In a magazine? Is there such an
Enter Input : article? I didn't know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I want to see Sofya Semyonovna," Dounia articulated faintly. "How do I
Enter Input : go to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps
Enter Input : she..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.
Enter Input : She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in
Enter Input : till quite late."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the
Enter Input : time.... I don't believe you! I don't believe you!" cried Dounia,
Enter Input : completely losing her head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to
Enter Input : give her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.
Enter Input : Drink a little...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It has acted violently," Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.
Enter Input : "Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will
Enter Input : save him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get
Enter Input : a ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of
Enter Input : good deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great
Enter Input : man yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where are you going?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in
Enter Input : at that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "We couldn't be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far
Enter Input : from jeering; it's simply that I'm sick of talking like this. But how
Enter Input : can you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive
Enter Input : him to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already
Enter Input : being watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving
Enter Input : him away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He
Enter Input : can still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.
Enter Input : I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to
Enter Input : consider it thoroughly. But do sit down!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How can you save him? Can he really be saved?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It all depends on you, on you, on you alone," he began with glowing
Enter Input : eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for
Enter Input : emotion.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I'll save him. I have
Enter Input : money and friends. I'll send him away at once. I'll get a passport,
Enter Input : two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable
Enter Input : people.... If you like, I'll take a passport for you... for your
Enter Input : mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love
Enter Input : you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let
Enter Input : me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, 'do that,'
Enter Input : and I'll do it. I'll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you
Enter Input : believe, I will believe. I'll do anything--anything! Don't, don't look
Enter Input : at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to
Enter Input : his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Open it! Open it!" she called, shaking the door. "Open it! Is there no
Enter Input : one there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly
Enter Input : broke into an angry mocking smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There is no one at home," he said quietly and emphatically. "The
Enter Input : landlady has gone out, and it's waste of time to shout like that. You
Enter Input : are only exciting yourself uselessly."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I have lost the key and cannot find it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This is an outrage," cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed
Enter Input : to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a
Enter Input : little table.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
Enter Input : every movement he made.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
Enter Input : He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was
Enter Input : pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you
Enter Input : may be sure I've taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The
Enter Input : Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at
Enter Input : least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.
Enter Input : For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing
Enter Input : actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How
Enter Input : should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?
Enter Input : So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.
Enter Input : It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Scoundrel!" whispered Dounia indignantly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general
Enter Input : proposition. It's my personal conviction that you are perfectly
Enter Input : right--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have
Enter Input : no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your
Enter Input : own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to
Enter Input : circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think
Enter Input : about it. Your brother's and your mother's fate are in your hands. I
Enter Input : will be your slave... all my life... I will wait here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had
Enter Input : not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she
Enter Input : knew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it
Enter Input : and laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aha! So that's it, is it?" he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.
Enter Input : "Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You've made things
Enter Input : wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the
Enter Input : revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!
Enter Input : And how I've hunted for it! The shooting lessons I've given you in the
Enter Input : country have not been thrown away."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,
Enter Input : wretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began
Enter Input : to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I
Enter Input : swear I'll kill you." She was frantic.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But your brother? I ask from curiosity," said Svidrigaïlov, still
Enter Input : standing where he was.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Inform, if you want to! Don't stir! Don't come nearer! I'll shoot! You
Enter Input : poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!" She held the
Enter Input : revolver ready.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know
Enter Input : you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....
Enter Input : It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would
Enter Input : have been the cause."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are lying! I hated you always, always...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened
Enter Input : to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember
Enter Input : that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's a lie," there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, "that's a
Enter Input : lie and a libel!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A lie? Well, if you like, it's a lie. I made it up. Women ought not
Enter Input : to be reminded of such things," he smiled. "I know you will shoot, you
Enter Input : pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the
Enter Input : distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was
Enter Input : white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had
Enter Input : never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment
Enter Input : she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of
Enter Input : anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The
Enter Input : bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and
Enter Input : laughed softly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What's this?
Enter Input : Blood?" he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed
Enter Input : in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just
Enter Input : grazed the skin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in
Enter Input : terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what
Enter Input : she was doing and what was going on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, you missed! Fire again, I'll wait," said Svidrigaïlov softly,
Enter Input : still smiling, but gloomily. "If you go on like that, I shall have time
Enter Input : to seize you before you cock again."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me be," she cried in despair. "I swear I'll shoot again. I... I'll
Enter Input : kill you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don't...
Enter Input : then." His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot
Enter Input : again: it missed fire.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You haven't loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge
Enter Input : there. Get it ready, I'll wait."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild
Enter Input : determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia
Enter Input : saw that he would sooner die than let her go. "And... now, of course she
Enter Input : would kill him, at two paces!" Suddenly she flung away the revolver.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "She's dropped it!" said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep
Enter Input : breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only
Enter Input : the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
Enter Input : It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,
Enter Input : which he could not himself have defined.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not
Enter Input : resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.
Enter Input : He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to
Enter Input : utter a sound.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me go," Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was
Enter Input : quite different.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Then you don't love me?" he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And... and you can't? Never?" he whispered in despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Never!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly
Enter Input : he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
Enter Input : Another moment passed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here's the key."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table
Enter Input : behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Take it! Make haste!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to
Enter Input : take the key.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Make haste! Make haste!" repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning
Enter Input : or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that
Enter Input : "make haste."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it
Enter Input : quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she
Enter Input : ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he
Enter Input : slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A
Enter Input : strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of
Enter Input : despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.
Enter Input : He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.
Enter Input : The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly
Enter Input : caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket
Enter Input : three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still
Enter Input : two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He
Enter Input : thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went
Enter Input : out.

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VI
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He spent that evening till ten o'clock going from one low haunt to
Enter Input : another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "villain and tyrant,"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "began kissing Katia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and
Enter Input : the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these
Enter Input : clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the
Enter Input : left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure
Enter Input : garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky
Enter Input : three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a
Enter Input : "Vauxhall," which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was
Enter Input : served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
Enter Input : A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed
Enter Input : German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The
Enter Input : clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for
Enter Input : a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no
Enter Input : possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was
Enter Input : that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in
Enter Input : selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his
Enter Input : companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon
Enter Input : belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem
Enter Input : troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of
Enter Input : the garden. It was about six o'clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine
Enter Input : all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than
Enter Input : anything.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over
Enter Input : the sky about ten o'clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain
Enter Input : came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the
Enter Input : earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each
Enter Input : flash lasted while one could count five.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the
Enter Input : bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,
Enter Input : putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,
Enter Input : but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the
Enter Input : rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room
Enter Input : without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She
Enter Input : was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,
Enter Input : looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at
Enter Input : once in indescribable terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.
Enter Input : She timidly prepared to listen.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna," said Svidrigaïlov, "and
Enter Input : as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some
Enter Input : arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to
Enter Input : you, you need not tell me." (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) "Those
Enter Input : people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your
Enter Input : brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them
Enter Input : I've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had
Enter Input : better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take
Enter Input : them! Well now, that's settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the
Enter Input : value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for
Enter Input : yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one
Enter Input : knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on
Enter Input : living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no
Enter Input : need for it now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my
Enter Input : stepmother," said Sonia hurriedly, "and if I've said so little... please
Enter Input : don't consider..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's enough! that's enough!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,
Enter Input : but I don't need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don't think me
Enter Input : ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste words
Enter Input : over it. I haven't time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch
Enter Input : has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia." (Sonia looked
Enter Input : wildly at him, and started.) "Don't be uneasy, I know all about it from
Enter Input : himself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone. It was good advice
Enter Input : when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much
Enter Input : better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and
Enter Input : you will follow him. That's so, isn't it? And if so, you'll need money.
Enter Input : You'll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same
Enter Input : as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
Enter Input : what's owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so
Enter Input : heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and not
Enter Input : yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.
Enter Input : You can't get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned
Enter Input : about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don't say
Enter Input : anything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money to
Enter Input : anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye." (He got up.) "My
Enter Input : greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you'd better put the money
Enter Input : for the present in Mr. Razumihin's keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of
Enter Input : course you do. He's not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...
Enter Input : when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she
Enter Input : did not dare and did not know how to begin.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,
Enter Input : Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to
Enter Input : others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.
Enter Input : Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure
Enter Input : to."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague
Enter Input : apprehension.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,
Enter Input : he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still
Enter Input : persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where
Enter Input : the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky
Enter Input : Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit
Enter Input : at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be
Enter Input : very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very
Enter Input : intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had
Enter Input : probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing
Enter Input : vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the
Enter Input : conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct
Enter Input : question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she
Enter Input : were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov
Enter Input : would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and
Enter Input : almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only
Enter Input : by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other
Enter Input : occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady
Enter Input : Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his
Enter Input : betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she
Enter Input : had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important
Enter Input : affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her
Enter Input : fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from
Enter Input : him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present
Enter Input : before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his
Enter Input : immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that
Enter Input : purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went
Enter Input : off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,
Enter Input : the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the
Enter Input : other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced
Enter Input : by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,
Enter Input : laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon
Enter Input : come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a
Enter Input : sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though
Enter Input : he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be
Enter Input : immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He
Enter Input : went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but
Enter Input : the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of
Enter Input : the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was
Enter Input : a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great
Enter Input : wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start
Enter Input : off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that
Enter Input : there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he
Enter Input : was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,
Enter Input : and all these people of high society didn't think of what was said of
Enter Input : them and didn't stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that
Enter Input : on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a
Enter Input : word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and
Enter Input : the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the
Enter Input : cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said
Enter Input : to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up
Enter Input : whispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,
Enter Input : amazed and rather sorrowful.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the
Enter Input : way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring
Enter Input : wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black
Enter Input : waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.
Enter Input : But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and
Enter Input : went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long
Enter Input : time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the
Enter Input : wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side
Enter Input : of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that
Enter Input : there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly
Enter Input : large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was
Enter Input : not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place
Enter Input : that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,
Enter Input : blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were
Enter Input : lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked
Enter Input : a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,
Enter Input : scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a
Enter Input : close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under
Enter Input : the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow
Enter Input : looked inquiringly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is there tea?" asked Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, sir."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What else is there?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Veal, vodka, savouries."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bring me tea and veal."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And you want nothing else?" he asked with apparent surprise.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing, nothing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It must be a nice place," thought Svidrigaïlov. "How was it I didn't
Enter Input : know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have
Enter Input : had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stay
Enter Input : here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a
Enter Input : room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;
Enter Input : it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained
Enter Input : chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they
Enter Input : were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty
Enter Input : that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general
Enter Input : colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short
Enter Input : by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under
Enter Input : the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into
Enter Input : thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout
Enter Input : in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from
Enter Input : the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and
Enter Input : almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw
Enter Input : light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The
Enter Input : room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of
Enter Input : them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing
Enter Input : in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to
Enter Input : preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached
Enter Input : the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He
Enter Input : declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn
Enter Input : him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it
Enter Input : all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the
Enter Input : air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't. He sometimes
Enter Input : turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not
Enter Input : the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A
Enter Input : candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly
Enter Input : empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs
Enter Input : of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away
Enter Input : indifferently and sat down on the bed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking
Enter Input : him again whether he didn't want anything more, and again receiving a
Enter Input : negative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a
Enter Input : glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began
Enter Input : to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the
Enter Input : blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. "It would have been better
Enter Input : to be well for the occasion," he thought with a smile. The room was
Enter Input : close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard
Enter Input : a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of
Enter Input : leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He
Enter Input : felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. "It must be a garden
Enter Input : under the window," he thought. "There's a sound of trees. How I dislike
Enter Input : the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a
Enter Input : horrid feeling." He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed
Enter Input : Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little
Enter Input : Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. "I never have
Enter Input : liked water," he thought, "even in a landscape," and he suddenly smiled
Enter Input : again at a strange idea: "Surely now all these questions of taste and
Enter Input : comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an
Enter Input : animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought
Enter Input : to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,
Enter Input : ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why
Enter Input : haven't I put out the candle?" he blew it out. "They've gone to bed next
Enter Input : door," he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. "Well, now, Marfa
Enter Input : Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the very
Enter Input : time and place for you. But now you won't come!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on
Enter Input : Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin's
Enter Input : keeping. "I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to
Enter Input : tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He's gone through a
Enter Input : good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got over
Enter Input : his nonsense. But now he's _too_ eager for life. These young men
Enter Input : are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please
Enter Input : himself, it's nothing to do with me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's image rose before him,
Enter Input : and a shudder ran over him. "No, I must give up all that now," he
Enter Input : thought, rousing himself. "I must think of something else. It's queer
Enter Input : and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly
Enter Input : desired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad
Enter Input : sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that's
Enter Input : a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!
Enter Input : But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me
Enter Input : somehow...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia's image
Enter Input : rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,
Enter Input : she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that
Enter Input : he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand
Enter Input : to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that
Enter Input : instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his
Enter Input : heart...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly
Enter Input : something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He
Enter Input : started. "Ugh! hang it! I believe it's a mouse," he thought, "that's the
Enter Input : veal I left on the table." He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the
Enter Input : blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over
Enter Input : his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking
Enter Input : with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
Enter Input : He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
Enter Input : He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without
Enter Input : leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and
Enter Input : suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one
Enter Input : instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down
Enter Input : his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket
Enter Input : as before. The wind was howling under the window. "How disgusting," he
Enter Input : thought with annoyance.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the
Enter Input : window. "It's better not to sleep at all," he decided. There was a cold
Enter Input : damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the
Enter Input : blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of
Enter Input : anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,
Enter Input : incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his
Enter Input : mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or
Enter Input : the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees
Enter Input : roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling
Enter Input : on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,
Enter Input : warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country
Enter Input : cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with
Enter Input : flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was
Enter Input : surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with
Enter Input : rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed
Enter Input : particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant
Enter Input : narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was
Enter Input : reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came
Enter Input : into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,
Enter Input : the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
Enter Input : The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows
Enter Input : were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were
Enter Input : chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table
Enter Input : covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was
Enter Input : covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of
Enter Input : flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a
Enter Input : white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as
Enter Input : though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was
Enter Input : a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of
Enter Input : her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her
Enter Input : pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle
Enter Input : beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
Enter Input : She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed
Enter Input : herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish
Enter Input : soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn
Enter Input : from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on
Enter Input : a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the
Enter Input : window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously
Enter Input : into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with
Enter Input : his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been
Enter Input : something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,
Enter Input : probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of
Enter Input : rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as
Enter Input : in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of
Enter Input : objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,
Enter Input : gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed
Enter Input : by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. "Ah, the
Enter Input : signal! The river is overflowing," he thought. "By morning it will be
Enter Input : swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and
Enter Input : cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain
Enter Input : and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is
Enter Input : it now?" And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on
Enter Input : the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go out at once
Enter Input : straight to the park. I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,
Enter Input : so that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on
Enter Input : one's head."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his
Enter Input : waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,
Enter Input : into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep
Enter Input : somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay
Enter Input : him for the room and leave the hotel. "It's the best minute; I couldn't
Enter Input : choose a better."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
Enter Input : anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner
Enter Input : between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object
Enter Input : which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little
Enter Input : girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her
Enter Input : clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big
Enter Input : black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been
Enter Input : crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child's face
Enter Input : was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. "How can she have come here?
Enter Input : She must have hidden here and not slept all night." He began questioning
Enter Input : her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby
Enter Input : language, something about "mammy" and that "mammy would beat her," and
Enter Input : about some cup that she had "bwoken." The child chattered on without
Enter Input : stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a
Enter Input : neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service
Enter Input : of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken
Enter Input : a cup of her mother's and was so frightened that she had run away the
Enter Input : evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the
Enter Input : rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and
Enter Input : spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness
Enter Input : and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his
Enter Input : arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing
Enter Input : her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as
Enter Input : wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had
Enter Input : undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in
Enter Input : the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he
Enter Input : sank into dreary musing again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What folly to trouble myself," he decided suddenly with an oppressive
Enter Input : feeling of annoyance. "What idiocy!" In vexation he took up the candle
Enter Input : to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
Enter Input : "Damn the child!" he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again
Enter Input : to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.
Enter Input : The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,
Enter Input : and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed
Enter Input : brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. "It's a flush
Enter Input : of fever," thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as
Enter Input : though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were
Enter Input : hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long
Enter Input : black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a
Enter Input : sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little
Enter Input : girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in
Enter Input : a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to
Enter Input : control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,
Enter Input : a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite
Enter Input : unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the
Enter Input : shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they
Enter Input : turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited
Enter Input : him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that
Enter Input : laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. "What,
Enter Input : at five years old?" Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. "What does
Enter Input : it mean?" And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding
Enter Input : out her arms.... "Accursed child!" Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand
Enter Input : to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not
Enter Input : been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've had nightmare all night!" He got up angrily, feeling utterly
Enter Input : shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could
Enter Input : see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,
Enter Input : put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his
Enter Input : pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his
Enter Input : pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few
Enter Input : lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his
Enter Input : elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some
Enter Input : flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on
Enter Input : the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began
Enter Input : trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.
Enter Input : At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he
Enter Input : started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he
Enter Input : was in the street.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the
Enter Input : slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing
Enter Input : the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,
Enter Input : the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the
Enter Input : bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think
Enter Input : of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.
Enter Input : The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with
Enter Input : their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and
Enter Input : he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read
Enter Input : each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and
Enter Input : came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with
Enter Input : its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead
Enter Input : drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower
Enter Input : stood up on the left. "Bah!" he shouted, "here is a place. Why should
Enter Input : it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness
Enter Input : anyway...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where
Enter Input : there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of
Enter Input : the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,
Enter Input : wrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his
Enter Input : head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His
Enter Input : face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly
Enter Input : printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes
Enter Input : without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man
Enter Input : not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a
Enter Input : word.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What do you want here?" he said, without moving or changing his
Enter Input : position.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Nothing, brother, good morning," answered Svidrigaïlov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "This isn't the place."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am going to foreign parts, brother."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To foreign parts?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "To America."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "America."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his
Enter Input : eyebrows.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I say, this is not the place for such jokes!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why shouldn't it be the place?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Because it isn't."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Well, brother, I don't mind that. It's a good place. When you are
Enter Input : asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He put the revolver to his right temple.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You can't do it here, it's not the place," cried Achilles, rousing
Enter Input : himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VII
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The same day, about seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on
Enter Input : his way to his mother's and sister's lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev's
Enter Input : house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from
Enter Input : the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still
Enter Input : hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:
Enter Input : his decision was taken.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Besides, it doesn't matter, they still know nothing," he thought, "and
Enter Input : they are used to thinking of me as eccentric."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a
Enter Input : night's rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the
Enter Input : inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all
Enter Input : the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a
Enter Input : decision.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not
Enter Input : at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by
Enter Input : the hand and drew him into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here you are!" she began, faltering with joy. "Don't be angry with
Enter Input : me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not
Enter Input : crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I've got
Enter Input : into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I've been like that ever
Enter Input : since your father's death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you
Enter Input : must be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I was in the rain yesterday, mother...." Raskolnikov began.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, no," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, "you thought I
Enter Input : was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don't be
Enter Input : anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I've learned the ways
Enter Input : here and truly I see for myself that they are better. I've made up my
Enter Input : mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to
Enter Input : give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,
Enter Input : or what ideas you are hatching; so it's not for me to keep nudging your
Enter Input : elbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why
Enter Input : am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your
Enter Input : article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch
Enter Input : brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: 'There,
Enter Input : foolish one,' I thought, 'that's what he is busy about; that's the
Enter Input : solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may
Enter Input : have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I
Enter Input : worry him and upset him.' I read it, my dear, and of course there was a
Enter Input : great deal I did not understand; but that's only natural--how should I?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Show me, mother."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous
Enter Input : as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and
Enter Input : bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he
Enter Input : sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only
Enter Input : a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed
Enter Input : with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding
Enter Input : months. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you
Enter Input : will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the
Enter Input : world of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You
Enter Input : don't know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,
Enter Input : how could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but
Enter Input : believing it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to
Enter Input : magazines--the first time poems (I've got the manuscript and will show
Enter Input : you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it
Enter Input : out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren't! I was
Enter Input : breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your
Enter Input : clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish
Enter Input : I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and
Enter Input : talent. No doubt you don't care about that for the present and you are
Enter Input : occupied with much more important matters...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia's not at home, mother?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, Rodya. I often don't see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri
Enter Input : Prokofitch comes to see me, it's so good of him, and he always talks
Enter Input : about you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don't say that
Enter Input : Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has
Enter Input : her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and
Enter Input : I never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia
Enter Input : has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don't
Enter Input : know what it will all lead to. You've made me so happy by coming now,
Enter Input : Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I'll tell
Enter Input : her: 'Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all
Enter Input : this time?' You mustn't spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,
Enter Input : but if you can't, it doesn't matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,
Enter Input : that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what
Enter Input : you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you'll
Enter Input : come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you've come now to
Enter Input : comfort your mother, I see that."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Here I am again! Don't mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I
Enter Input : sitting here?" she cried, jumping up. "There is coffee and I don't offer
Enter Input : you any. Ah, that's the selfishness of old age. I'll get it at once!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother, don't trouble, I am going at once. I haven't come for that.
Enter Input : Please listen to me."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are
Enter Input : told about me, will you always love me as you do now?" he asked suddenly
Enter Input : from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and
Enter Input : not weighing them.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?
Enter Input : Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn't believe
Enter Input : anyone, I should refuse to listen."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've come to assure you that I've always loved you and I am glad
Enter Input : that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out," he went on with the same
Enter Input : impulse. "I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you
Enter Input : must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all
Enter Input : you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn't care about you, was
Enter Input : all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that's enough:
Enter Input : I thought I must do this and begin with this...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her
Enter Input : bosom and weeping gently.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't know what is wrong with you, Rodya," she said at last. "I've
Enter Input : been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see
Enter Input : that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that's why you are
Enter Input : miserable. I've foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking
Enter Input : about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister
Enter Input : lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I
Enter Input : caught something, but I couldn't make it out. I felt all the morning
Enter Input : as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting
Enter Input : something, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You
Enter Input : are going away somewhere?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "That's what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need
Enter Input : me. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya
Enter Input : Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon
Enter Input : her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.
Enter Input : But... where... are you going?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Good-bye, mother."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, to-day?" she cried, as though losing him for ever.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I can't stay, I must go now...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And can't I come with you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will
Enter Input : reach Him."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That's right, that's
Enter Input : right. Oh, God, what are we doing?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that
Enter Input : he was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful
Enter Input : months his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her
Enter Input : feet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not
Enter Input : question him this time. For some days she had realised that something
Enter Input : awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had
Enter Input : come for him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, my darling, my first born," she said sobbing, "now you are just
Enter Input : as when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and
Enter Input : kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us
Enter Input : simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we
Enter Input : wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I've been crying
Enter Input : lately, it's that my mother's heart had a foreboding of trouble. The
Enter Input : first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived
Enter Input : here, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day
Enter Input : when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had
Enter Input : come. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You'll come again?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... I'll come."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodya, don't be angry, I don't dare to question you. I know I mustn't.
Enter Input : Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Very far."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What God sends... only pray for me." Raskolnikov went to the door, but
Enter Input : she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked
Enter Input : with terror.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Enough, mother," said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Not for ever, it's not yet for ever? You'll come, you'll come
Enter Input : to-morrow?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I will, I will, good-bye." He tore himself away at last.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all
Enter Input : before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the
Enter Input : stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him
Enter Input : intently. "Can anyone have come to see me?" he wondered. He had a
Enter Input : disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She
Enter Input : was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had
Enter Input : been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from
Enter Input : the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,
Enter Input : betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at
Enter Input : once that she knew.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Am I to come in or go away?" he asked uncertainly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.
Enter Input : We thought that you would be sure to come there."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this
Enter Input : moment to be able to control myself."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He glanced at her mistrustfully.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Where were you all night?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I don't remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind
Enter Input : once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that
Enter Input : I wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn't make up my mind," he
Enter Input : whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and
Enter Input : I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in mother's arms; I
Enter Input : haven't faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don't know
Enter Input : how it is, Dounia, I don't understand it."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Have you been at mother's? Have you told her?" cried Dounia,
Enter Input : horror-stricken. "Surely you haven't done that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I didn't tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.
Enter Input : She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it
Enter Input : already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don't know why I did
Enter Input : go. I am a contemptible person, Dounia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren't
Enter Input : you?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of
Enter Input : drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that
Enter Input : if I had considered myself strong till now I'd better not be afraid of
Enter Input : disgrace," he said, hurrying on. "It's pride, Dounia."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Pride, Rodya."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad
Enter Input : to think that he was still proud.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?" he
Enter Input : asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, Rodya, hush!" cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two
Enter Input : minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the
Enter Input : other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got
Enter Input : up.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's late, it's time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I
Enter Input : don't know why I am going to give myself up."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Big tears fell down her cheeks.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You doubted it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She threw her arms round him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Aren't you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?" she
Enter Input : cried, holding him close and kissing him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Crime? What crime?" he cried in sudden fury. "That I killed a vile
Enter Input : noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing
Enter Input : her was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor
Enter Input : people. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking
Enter Input : of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? 'A
Enter Input : crime! a crime!' Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,
Enter Input : now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It's simply
Enter Input : because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,
Enter Input : perhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?" cried
Enter Input : Dounia in despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Which all men shed," he put in almost frantically, "which flows and has
Enter Input : always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which
Enter Input : men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of
Enter Input : mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to
Enter Input : do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds
Enter Input : to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply
Enter Input : clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now
Enter Input : that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that
Enter Input : stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to
Enter Input : take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have
Enter Input : been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...
Enter Input : I couldn't carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,
Enter Input : that's what's the matter! And yet I won't look at it as you do. If I had
Enter Input : succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I'm trapped."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "But that's not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Ah, it's not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to
Enter Input : understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.
Enter Input : The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I've never,
Enter Input : never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever
Enter Input : from seeing that what I did was a crime. I've never, never been stronger
Enter Input : and more convinced than now."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered
Enter Input : his last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia's eyes and he saw such
Enter Input : anguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he
Enter Input : had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,
Enter Input : the cause...
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven
Enter Input : if I am guilty). Good-bye! We won't dispute. It's time, high time to go.
Enter Input : Don't follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you
Enter Input : go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It's my last request
Enter Input : of you. Don't leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that
Enter Input : she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with
Enter Input : her! Razumihin will be with you. I've been talking to him.... Don't cry
Enter Input : about me: I'll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a
Enter Input : murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won't disgrace you,
Enter Input : you will see; I'll still show.... Now good-bye for the present," he
Enter Input : concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia's
Enter Input : eyes at his last words and promises. "Why are you crying? Don't cry,
Enter Input : don't cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I'd
Enter Input : forgotten!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took
Enter Input : from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was
Enter Input : the portrait of his landlady's daughter, who had died of fever, that
Enter Input : strange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the
Enter Input : delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave
Enter Input : it to Dounia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her," he said
Enter Input : thoughtfully. "To her heart I confided much of what has since been so
Enter Input : hideously realised. Don't be uneasy," he returned to Dounia, "she was
Enter Input : as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great
Enter Input : point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to
Enter Input : be broken in two," he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.
Enter Input : "Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?
Enter Input : They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What's the object of these
Enter Input : senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I
Enter Input : am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty
Enter Input : years' penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I
Enter Input : consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood
Enter Input : looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.
Enter Input : She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look
Enter Input : at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for
Enter Input : the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,
Enter Input : he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the
Enter Input : corner abruptly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I am wicked, I see that," he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a
Enter Input : moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. "But why are they so fond
Enter Input : of me if I don't deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved
Enter Input : me and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have
Enter Input : happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so
Enter Input : meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word
Enter Input : that I am a criminal? Yes, that's it, that's it, that's what they are
Enter Input : sending me there for, that's what they want. Look at them running to and
Enter Input : fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at
Enter Input : heart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they'd be
Enter Input : wild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could
Enter Input : be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
Enter Input : And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual
Enter Input : bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should
Enter Input : he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be
Enter Input : so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that
Enter Input : question since the previous evening, but still he went.
Enter Input :

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : CHAPTER VIII
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When he went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark. All day
Enter Input : Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been
Enter Input : waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov's words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the
Enter Input : conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.
Enter Input : Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her
Enter Input : brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his
Enter Input : confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;
Enter Input : she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,
Enter Input : but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and
Enter Input : at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point
Enter Input : of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at
Enter Input : Dounia. Dounia's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively
Enter Input : and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room had
Enter Input : remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her
Enter Input : brother's room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come
Enter Input : there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread
Enter Input : of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent
Enter Input : the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both
Enter Input : were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each
Enter Input : thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to
Enter Input : her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...
Enter Input : Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to
Enter Input : make him live?" she thought at last in despair.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
Enter Input : intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
Enter Input : unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to
Enter Input : feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned
Enter Input : pale.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes," said Raskolnikov, smiling. "I have come for your cross, Sonia. It
Enter Input : was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
Enter Input : now it's come to that?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
Enter Input : shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
Enter Input : words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid
Enter Input : meeting her eyes.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. There is one
Enter Input : fact.... But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it. But
Enter Input : do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish
Enter Input : faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid
Enter Input : questions, which I shall have to answer--they'll point their fingers at
Enter Input : me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I'd
Enter Input : rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
Enter Input : him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I've become
Enter Input : too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my
Enter Input : sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It's
Enter Input : a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the
Enter Input : crosses?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or
Enter Input : concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after
Enter Input : one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress
Enter Input : wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and
Enter Input : over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It's the symbol of my taking up the cross," he laughed. "As though I
Enter Input : had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant
Enter Input : one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's--you will wear yourself, show
Enter Input : me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like
Enter Input : these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old
Enter Input : woman's neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I
Enter Input : ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what
Enter Input : matters; I'm somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,
Enter Input : Sonia, so that you might know... that's all--that's all I came for. But
Enter Input : I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I
Enter Input : am going to prison and you'll have your wish. Well, what are you crying
Enter Input : for? You too? Don't. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. "Why
Enter Input : is she grieving too?" he thought to himself. "What am I to her? Why does
Enter Input : she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She'll
Enter Input : be my nurse."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Cross yourself, say at least one prayer," Sonia begged in a timid
Enter Input : broken voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But he wanted to say something quite different.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put
Enter Input : it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which
Enter Input : Marmeladov had spoken, "the family shawl." Raskolnikov thought of that
Enter Input : looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he
Enter Input : was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was
Enter Input : frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia
Enter Input : meant to go with him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I'll go
Enter Input : alone," he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved
Enter Input : towards the door. "What's the use of going in procession?" he muttered
Enter Input : going out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said
Enter Input : good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt
Enter Input : surged in his heart.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Was it right, was it right, all this?" he thought again as he went down
Enter Input : the stairs. "Couldn't he stop and retract it all... and not go?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn't ask
Enter Input : himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he
Enter Input : had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of
Enter Input : the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted
Enter Input : at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another
Enter Input : thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike
Enter Input : him then.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on
Enter Input : business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was
Enter Input : _going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away
Enter Input : just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I've sunk! No,
Enter Input : I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart
Enter Input : ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some
Enter Input : friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what
Enter Input : I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But
Enter Input : on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it
Enter Input : went to the Hay Market.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and
Enter Input : could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. "In
Enter Input : another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this
Enter Input : bridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember
Enter Input : this!" slipped into his mind. "Look at this sign! How shall I read those
Enter Input : letters then? It's written here 'Campany,' that's a thing to remember,
Enter Input : that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look
Enter Input : at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial
Enter Input : it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be
Enter Input : interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am
Enter Input : becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how
Enter Input : people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against
Enter Input : me, does he know whom he pushed? There's a peasant woman with a baby,
Enter Input : begging. It's curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might
Enter Input : give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here's a five copeck
Enter Input : piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my
Enter Input : good woman!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "God bless you," the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be
Enter Input : in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have
Enter Input : given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he
Enter Input : would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and
Enter Input : disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There
Enter Input : was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,
Enter Input : stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short
Enter Input : jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,
Enter Input : though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he
Enter Input : was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly
Enter Input : came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suddenly recalled Sonia's words, "Go to the cross-roads, bow down to
Enter Input : the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say
Enter Input : aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.'" He trembled, remembering
Enter Input : that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially
Enter Input : of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively
Enter Input : clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came
Enter Input : over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and
Enter Input : spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the
Enter Input : tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and
Enter Input : kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed
Enter Input : down a second time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's boozed," a youth near him observed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was a roar of laughter.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "He's going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children
Enter Input : and his country. He's bowing down to all the world and kissing the great
Enter Input : city of St. Petersburg and its pavement," added a workman who was a
Enter Input : little drunk.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Quite a young man, too!" observed a third.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "And a gentleman," someone observed soberly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, "I am
Enter Input : a murderer," which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,
Enter Input : died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking
Enter Input : round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a
Enter Input : glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt
Enter Input : that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he
Enter Input : saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding
Enter Input : from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had
Enter Input : followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt
Enter Input : and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow
Enter Input : him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his
Enter Input : heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third
Enter Input : storey. "I shall be some time going up," he thought. He felt as though
Enter Input : the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time
Enter Input : left for consideration.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
Enter Input : stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and
Enter Input : the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been
Enter Input : here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but
Enter Input : still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to
Enter Input : collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. "But why? what for?" he
Enter Input : wondered, reflecting. "If I must drink the cup what difference does it
Enter Input : make? The more revolting the better." He imagined for an instant the
Enter Input : figure of the "explosive lieutenant," Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually
Enter Input : going to him? Couldn't he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?
Enter Input : Couldn't he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings?
Enter Input : At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the "explosive
Enter Input : lieutenant"! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.
Enter Input : There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a
Enter Input : peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov walked into the next room. "Perhaps I still need not speak,"
Enter Input : passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
Enter Input : settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was
Enter Input : seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No one in?" Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Whom do you want?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the
Enter Input : Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I've forgotten! 'At
Enter Input : your service!'" a familiar voice cried suddenly.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He
Enter Input : had just come in from the third room. "It is the hand of fate," thought
Enter Input : Raskolnikov. "Why is he here?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You've come to see us? What about?" cried Ilya Petrovitch. He
Enter Input : was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle
Enter Input : exhilarated. "If it's on business you are rather early.[*] It's only a
Enter Input : chance that I am here... however I'll do what I can. I must admit, I...
Enter Input : what is it, what is it? Excuse me...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input :      [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
Enter Input :      sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
Enter Input :      police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
Enter Input :      coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Raskolnikov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn't imagine I'd forgotten? Don't think I
Enter Input : am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that's it, isn't it?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Rodion Romanovitch."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I
Enter Input : made many inquiries about you. I assure you I've been genuinely grieved
Enter Input : since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me
Enter Input : afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and
Enter Input : so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific
Enter Input : man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have
Enter Input : the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it's a genuine passion!
Enter Input : Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be
Enter Input : gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,
Enter Input : what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but
Enter Input : what's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that! I was even
Enter Input : meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd... But I
Enter Input : am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your
Enter Input : family have come?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, my mother and sister."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly
Enter Input : cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with
Enter Input : you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting
Enter Input : fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!
Enter Input : I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on
Enter Input : account of your family's arriving?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find
Enter Input : Zametov here."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, yes! Of course, you've made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is
Enter Input : not here. Yes, we've lost Zametov. He's not been here since yesterday...
Enter Input : he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a
Enter Input : feather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected something
Enter Input : from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.
Enter Input : He wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk and
Enter Input : boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it's a very
Enter Input : different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your
Enter Input : career is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure. For
Enter Input : you, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an
Enter Input : ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned
Enter Input : research--that's where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....
Enter Input : Have you read Livingstone's Travels?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "No."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,
Enter Input : and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I
Enter Input : ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me
Enter Input : openly, openly!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "N-no..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!
Enter Input : Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say
Enter Input : _friendship_ is quite another? No, you're wrong! It's not friendship,
Enter Input : but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of
Enter Input : love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound
Enter Input : to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.
Enter Input : Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad
Enter Input : reputation, over a glass of champagne... that's all your Zametov is good
Enter Input : for! While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty
Enter Input : feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and
Enter Input : have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is
Enter Input : he, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then
Enter Input : these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya
Enter Input : Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a
Enter Input : stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He
Enter Input : looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I mean those crop-headed wenches," the talkative Ilya Petrovitch
Enter Input : continued. "Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory
Enter Input : one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am
Enter Input : I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!" Ilya
Enter Input : Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. "It's an immoderate
Enter Input : zeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough. Why abuse
Enter Input : it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why
Enter Input : did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common
Enter Input : they are, you can't fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill
Enter Input : themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard
Enter Input : about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what
Enter Input : was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Svidrigaïlov," someone answered from the other room with drowsy
Enter Input : listlessness.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov started.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!" he cried.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes... I knew him.... He hadn't been here long."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, that's so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and
Enter Input : all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left
Enter Input : in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his
Enter Input : faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they
Enter Input : say. How did you come to know him?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had
Enter Input : no suspicion?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling
Enter Input : him.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here..."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Yes, I must go," muttered Raskolnikov. "Excuse my troubling you...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It's a pleasure to see you and I
Enter Input : am glad to say so."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I only wanted... I came to see Zametov."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "I... am very glad... good-bye," Raskolnikov smiled.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
Enter Input : what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself
Enter Input : with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed
Enter Input : past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in
Enter Input : the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a
Enter Input : rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.
Enter Input : There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.
Enter Input : She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of
Enter Input : poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips
Enter Input : worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned
Enter Input : and went back to the police office.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before
Enter Input : him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What's the matter?"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.
Enter Input : He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say
Enter Input : something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the
Enter Input : face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both
Enter Input : looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "It was I..." began Raskolnikov.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Drink some water."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,
Enter Input : but distinctly said:
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with
Enter Input : an axe and robbed them._"
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov repeated his statement.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : EPILOGUE
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : I
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of
Enter Input : the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,
Enter Input : in the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class
Enter Input : convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a
Enter Input : year and a half has passed since his crime.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered
Enter Input : exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor
Enter Input : misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit
Enter Input : the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the
Enter Input : secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which
Enter Input : was found in the murdered woman's hand. He described minutely how he
Enter Input : had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its
Enter Input : contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described how
Enter Input : Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said
Enter Input : to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay
Enter Input : and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards
Enter Input : gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
Enter Input : Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
Enter Input : The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the
Enter Input : judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he
Enter Input : had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making
Enter Input : use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the
Enter Input : trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had
Enter Input : never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed
Enter Input : incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and
Enter Input : seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,
Enter Input : some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
Enter Input : damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man
Enter Input : should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made
Enter Input : a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers
Enter Input : more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really
Enter Input : not looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when he
Enter Input : hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that
Enter Input : the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental
Enter Input : derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of
Enter Input : gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary
Enter Input : insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover
Enter Input : Raskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by
Enter Input : Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.
Enter Input : All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not
Enter Input : quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another
Enter Input : element in the case.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the
Enter Input : criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question
Enter Input : as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he
Enter Input : answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was
Enter Input : his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to
Enter Input : provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand
Enter Input : roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder
Enter Input : through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by
Enter Input : privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he
Enter Input : answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost
Enter Input : coarse....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,
Enter Input : perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,
Enter Input : but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange
Enter Input : and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.
Enter Input : There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition
Enter Input : of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he
Enter Input : had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his
Enter Input : abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the
Enter Input : murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man
Enter Input : commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the
Enter Input : confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by
Enter Input : the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,
Enter Input : and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no
Enter Input : suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did
Enter Input : much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner's
Enter Input : favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and
Enter Input : proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor
Enter Input : consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting
Enter Input : him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit
Enter Input : old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral
Enter Input : when he died. Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they
Enter Input : had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two
Enter Input : little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was
Enter Input : investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts
Enter Input : made an impression in his favour.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating
Enter Input : circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a
Enter Input : term of eight years only.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Dounia
Enter Input : and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the
Enter Input : trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so
Enter Input : as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time
Enter Input : to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna's
Enter Input : illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial
Enter Input : derangement of her intellect.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she
Enter Input : had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening
Enter Input : Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother's
Enter Input : questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her
Enter Input : mother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia
Enter Input : on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and
Enter Input : reputation.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never
Enter Input : asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the
Enter Input : contrary, she had her own version of her son's sudden departure; she
Enter Input : told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting
Enter Input : that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya
Enter Input : had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be
Enter Input : in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be
Enter Input : brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured
Enter Input : Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his
Enter Input : article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was
Enter Input : continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed
Enter Input : with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was
Enter Input : obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken
Enter Input : her suspicions.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange
Enter Input : silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of
Enter Input : getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived
Enter Input : on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of
Enter Input : great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother
Enter Input : suspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and was
Enter Input : afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any
Enter Input : case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of
Enter Input : her faculties.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave
Enter Input : such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her
Enter Input : without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and
Enter Input : suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood
Enter Input : lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive
Enter Input : her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely
Enter Input : silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that
Enter Input : the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her
Enter Input : brother's telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her
Enter Input : sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the
Enter Input : fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?
Enter Input : Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be
Enter Input : succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would
Enter Input : begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his
Enter Input : future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,
Enter Input : pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),
Enter Input : but she still went on talking.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin
Enter Input : and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last
Enter Input : the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the
Enter Input : separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in
Enter Input : his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least
Enter Input : of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving
Enter Input : up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every
Enter Input : natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There
Enter Input : they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would
Enter Input : begin a new life. They all wept at parting.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great
Enter Input : deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried
Enter Input : so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his
Enter Input : mother's illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly
Enter Input : reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the
Enter Input : party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word
Enter Input : passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it
Enter Input : would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his
Enter Input : sister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future
Enter Input : together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their
Enter Input : mother's illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last
Enter Input : set off.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and
Enter Input : sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.
Enter Input : During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
Enter Input : Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she
Enter Input : could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.
Enter Input : Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order
Enter Input : to take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;
Enter Input : both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till
Enter Input : then they rested their hopes on Sonia.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia's
Enter Input : marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more
Enter Input : melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how
Enter Input : Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father
Enter Input : and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two
Enter Input : little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria
Enter Input : Alexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was
Enter Input : continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with
Enter Input : strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public
Enter Input : conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would
Enter Input : begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the
Enter Input : student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did
Enter Input : not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid
Enter Input : excitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's name
Enter Input : and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the
Enter Input : address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted
Enter Input : on going to see her.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes
Enter Input : begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One
Enter Input : morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,
Enter Input : that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must
Enter Input : expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,
Enter Input : began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and
Enter Input : put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and
Enter Input : helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual
Enter Input : fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
Enter Input : taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.
Enter Input : It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she
Enter Input : dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her
Enter Input : son's terrible fate than they had supposed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, though
Enter Input : a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached
Enter Input : Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month
Enter Input : to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At
Enter Input : first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on
Enter Input : they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for
Enter Input : from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate
Enter Input : brother's life. Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact
Enter Input : detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's
Enter Input : surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no
Enter Input : conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of
Enter Input : any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the
Enter Input : simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,
Enter Input : what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her
Enter Input : and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The
Enter Input : picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness
Enter Input : and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but
Enter Input : facts.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,
Enter Input : especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not
Enter Input : ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave
Enter Input : him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and
Enter Input : that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last
Enter Input : of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly
Enter Input : affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although
Enter Input : he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off
Enter Input : from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;
Enter Input : that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,
Enter Input : had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely
Enter Input : seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he
Enter Input : had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his
Enter Input : work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent
Enter Input : about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that
Enter Input : at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have
Enter Input : his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,
Enter Input : declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote
Enter Input : further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she
Enter Input : had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were
Enter Input : crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a
Enter Input : rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that
Enter Input : he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply
Enter Input : from inattention and indifference.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,
Enter Input : had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and
Enter Input : rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and
Enter Input : almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when
Enter Input : she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him
Enter Input : on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was
Enter Input : brought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to
Enter Input : see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the
Enter Input : sheds on the banks of the Irtish.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some
Enter Input : acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there
Enter Input : was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an
Enter Input : indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the
Enter Input : authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task
Enter Input : was lightened and so on.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and
Enter Input : uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,
Enter Input : that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days
Enter Input : at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote
Enter Input : that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of
Enter Input : the hospital.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : II
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not
Enter Input : the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes
Enter Input : that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!
Enter Input : he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at
Enter Input : least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to
Enter Input : him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a
Enter Input : student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited
Enter Input : to his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed
Enter Input : of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?
Enter Input : Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he
Enter Input : was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with
Enter Input : his contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his
Enter Input : fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was
Enter Input : wounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he
Enter Input : could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even
Enter Input : shame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated
Enter Input : conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except
Enter Input : a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just
Enter Input : because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief
Enter Input : through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to
Enter Input : "the idiocy" of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a
Enter Input : continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before
Enter Input : him. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he
Enter Input : would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to
Enter Input : live for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live
Enter Input : in order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to
Enter Input : give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.
Enter Input : Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted
Enter Input : more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he
Enter Input : had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that
Enter Input : would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the
Enter Input : awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would
Enter Input : have been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.
Enter Input : But he did not repent of his crime.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he
Enter Input : had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.
Enter Input : But now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his
Enter Input : actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque
Enter Input : as they had seemed at the fatal time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "In what way," he asked himself, "was my theory stupider than others
Enter Input : that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has
Enter Input : only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced
Enter Input : by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.
Enter Input : Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "Why does my action strike them as so horrible?" he said to himself. "Is
Enter Input : it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at
Enter Input : rest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law
Enter Input : was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the
Enter Input : law... and that's enough. Of course, in that case many of the
Enter Input : benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of
Enter Input : inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But
Enter Input : those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn't, and so I
Enter Input : had no right to have taken that step."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact
Enter Input : that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why
Enter Input : had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the
Enter Input : desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not
Enter Input : Svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,
Enter Input : at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had
Enter Input : perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and
Enter Input : his convictions. He didn't understand that that consciousness might be
Enter Input : the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future
Enter Input : resurrection.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he
Enter Input : could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at
Enter Input : his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and
Enter Input : prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in
Enter Input : prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of
Enter Input : them, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for
Enter Input : a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away
Enter Input : in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and
Enter Input : longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the
Enter Input : green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he
Enter Input : saw still more inexplicable examples.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not
Enter Input : want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome
Enter Input : and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that
Enter Input : surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much
Enter Input : that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was
Enter Input : the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They
Enter Input : seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at
Enter Input : him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his
Enter Input : isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons
Enter Input : were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political
Enter Input : prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as
Enter Input : ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.
Enter Input : He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the
Enter Input : Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former
Enter Input : officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
Enter Input : He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at
Enter Input : last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised
Enter Input : and laughed at his crime.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're a gentleman," they used to say. "You shouldn't hack about with
Enter Input : an axe; that's not a gentleman's work."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his
Enter Input : gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out
Enter Input : one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : "You're an infidel! You don't believe in God," they shouted. "You ought
Enter Input : to be killed."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to
Enter Input : kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at
Enter Input : him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;
Enter Input : his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard
Enter Input : succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would
Enter Input : have been bloodshed.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so
Enter Input : fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met
Enter Input : them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet
Enter Input : everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,
Enter Input : knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no
Enter Input : particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents
Enter Input : of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between
Enter Input : them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their
Enter Input : relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their
Enter Input : instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives
Enter Input : and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited
Enter Input : Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they
Enter Input : all took off their hats to her. "Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you
Enter Input : are our dear, good little mother," coarse branded criminals said to that
Enter Input : frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was
Enter Input : delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round
Enter Input : to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in
Enter Input : fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her
Enter Input : for help in their illnesses.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When
Enter Input : he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish
Enter Input : and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a
Enter Input : terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of
Enter Input : Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts
Enter Input : of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were
Enter Input : endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once
Enter Input : mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual
Enter Input : and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never
Enter Input : had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their
Enter Input : moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples
Enter Input : went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand
Enter Input : one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched
Enter Input : looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung
Enter Input : his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to
Enter Input : consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom
Enter Input : to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They
Enter Input : gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march
Enter Input : the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken
Enter Input : and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting
Enter Input : and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in
Enter Input : the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was
Enter Input : summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,
Enter Input : because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they
Enter Input : could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed
Enter Input : on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something
Enter Input : quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,
Enter Input : fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All
Enter Input : men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and
Enter Input : moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole
Enter Input : world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and
Enter Input : a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these
Enter Input : men, no one had heard their words and their voices.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so
Enter Input : miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.
Enter Input : The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring
Enter Input : days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel
Enter Input : paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during
Enter Input : his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was
Enter Input : difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially
Enter Input : in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the
Enter Input : windows of the ward.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On
Enter Input : waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the
Enter Input : distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.
Enter Input : Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and
Enter Input : moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day
Enter Input : after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was
Enter Input : discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that
Enter Input : Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that
Enter Input : her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,
Enter Input : Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,
Enter Input : that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and
Enter Input : see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he
Enter Input : went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster
Enter Input : and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only
Enter Input : three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the
Enter Input : fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and
Enter Input : laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river
Enter Input : bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the
Enter Input : wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before
Enter Input : him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
Enter Input : In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black
Enter Input : specks, the nomads' tents. There there was freedom, there other men were
Enter Input : living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand
Enter Input : still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.
Enter Input : Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into
Enter Input : contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited
Enter Input : and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up
Enter Input : noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the
Enter Input : morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the
Enter Input : green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and
Enter Input : paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand
Enter Input : with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand
Enter Input : to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would
Enter Input : repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always
Enter Input : seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout
Enter Input : her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply
Enter Input : grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance
Enter Input : at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were
Enter Input : alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to
Enter Input : seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round
Enter Input : her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she
Enter Input : turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same
Enter Input : moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her
Enter Input : eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and
Enter Input : that at last the moment had come....
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They
Enter Input : were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the
Enter Input : dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were
Enter Input : renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the
Enter Input : heart of the other.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to
Enter Input : wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before
Enter Input : them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his
Enter Input : being, while she--she only lived in his life.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,
Enter Input : Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied
Enter Input : that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him
Enter Input : differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered
Enter Input : him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound
Enter Input : to be so. Wasn't everything now bound to be changed?
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her
Enter Input : and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.
Enter Input : But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what
Enter Input : infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,
Enter Input : _all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence
Enter Input : and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an
Enter Input : external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not
Enter Input : think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have
Enter Input : analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped
Enter Input : into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself
Enter Input : out in his mind.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.
Enter Input : The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the
Enter Input : raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry
Enter Input : him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with
Enter Input : books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject
Enter Input : and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it
Enter Input : himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without
Enter Input : a word. Till now he had not opened it.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: "Can
Enter Input : her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at
Enter Input : least...."
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken
Enter Input : ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was
Enter Input : almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At
Enter Input : the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready
Enter Input : to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not
Enter Input : know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would
Enter Input : have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great
Enter Input : suffering.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual
Enter Input : renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing
Enter Input : from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.
Enter Input : That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is
Enter Input : ended.

Enter Input : spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
Enter Input : increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
Enter Input : freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

Enter Input : status with the IRS.
Enter Input : 
Enter Input : The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
Enter Input : charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
Enter Input : States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
Enter Input : considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

Enter Input : where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
Enter Input : SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

Enter Input : 
Enter Input : International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
